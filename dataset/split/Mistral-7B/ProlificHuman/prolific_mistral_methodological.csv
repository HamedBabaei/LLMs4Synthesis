The fluorescence intensity of N-CDs decreases with the temperature increasing, while it can recover to the initial one with the temperature decreasing. It is an accurate linear response of fluorescence intensity to temperature, which may be attributed to the synergistic effect of abundant oxygen-containing functional groups and hydrogen bonds. Further experiments also demonstrate that N-CDs can serve as effective in vitro and in vivo fluorescence-based nanothermometer.",10.1021/acsami.5b08782,Carbon Dot Nanothermometry: Intracellular Photoluminescence Lifetime Thermal Sensing,"Nanoscale biocompatible photoluminescence (PL) thermometers that can be used to accurately and reliably monitor intracellular temperatures have many potential applications in biology and medicine. Ideally, such nanothermometers should be functional at physiological pH across a wide range of ionic strengths, probe concentrations, and local environments. Here, we show that water-soluble N,S-co-doped carbon dots (CDs) exhibit temperature-dependent photoluminescence lifetimes and can serve as highly sensitive and reliable intracellular nanothermometers. PL intensity measurements indicate that these CDs have many advantages over alternative semiconductor- and CD-based nanoscale temperature sensors. Importantly, their PL lifetimes remain constant over wide ranges of pH values (5-12), CD concentrations (1.5 × 10-5 to 0.5 mg/mL), and environmental ionic strengths (up to 0.7 mol·L-1 NaCl). Moreover, they are biocompatible and nontoxic, as demonstrated by cell viability and flow cytometry analyses using NIH/3T3 and HeLa cell lines. N,S-CD thermal sensors also exhibit good water dispersibility, superior photo- and thermostability, extraordinary environment and concentration independence, high storage stability, and reusability-their PL decay curves at temperatures between 15 and 45 °C remained unchanged over seven sequential experiments. In vitro PL lifetime-based temperature sensing performed with human cervical cancer HeLa cells demonstrated the great potential of these nanosensors in biomedicine. Overall, N,S-doped CDs exhibit excitation-independent emission with strongly temperature-dependent monoexponential decay, making them suitable for both in vitro and in vivo luminescence lifetime thermometry.",10.1021/acsnano.6b06670,Intracellular ratiometric temperature sensing using fluorescent carbon dots,A self-referencing dual fluorescing carbon dot-based nanothermometer can ratiometrically sense thermal events in HeLa cells with very high sensitivity.,10.1039/c8na00255j,"Dual functional highly luminescence B, N Co-doped carbon nanodots as nanothermometer and Fe3+/Fe2+ sensor","AbstractDual functional fluorescence nanosensors have many potential applications in biology and medicine. Monitoring temperature with higher precision at localized small length scales or in a nanocavity is a necessity in various applications. As well as the detection of biologically interesting metal ions using low-cost and sensitive approach is of great importance in bioanalysis. In this paper, we describe the preparation of dual-function highly fluorescent B, N-co-doped carbon nanodots (CDs) that work as chemical and thermal sensors. The CDs emit blue fluorescence peaked at 450 nm and exhibit up to 70% photoluminescence quantum yield with showing excitation-independent fluorescence. We also show that water-soluble CDs display temperature-dependent fluorescence and can serve as highly sensitive and reliable nanothermometers with a thermo-sensitivity 1.8% °C−1, and wide range thermo-sensing between 0–90 °C with excellent recovery. Moreover, the fluorescence emission of CDs are selectively quenched after the addition of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions while show no quenching with adding other common metal cations and anions. The fluorescence emission shows a good linear correlation with concentration of Fe2+ and Fe3+ (R2 = 0.9908 for Fe2+ and R2 = 0.9892 for Fe3+) with a detection limit of of 80.0 ± 0.5 nM for Fe2+ and 110.0 ± 0.5 nM for Fe3+. Considering the high quantum yield and selectivity, CDs are exploited to design a nanoprobe towards iron detection in a biological sample.

Fluorescent carbon dots, such as N-doped and N,S-co-doped ones, exhibit strong temperature-dependent photoluminescence properties, making them suitable for intracellular nanothermometry (1, 2). The methodologies in these studies involve synthesizing carbon dots with specific doping elements and functional groups to enhance their thermal sensitivity and biocompatibility. For instance, N-doped carbon dots show a linear response of fluorescence intensity to temperature due to the synergistic effect of oxygen-containing functional groups and hydrogen bonds (1). On the other hand, N,S-co-doped carbon dots maintain their photoluminescence lifetimes constant over wide ranges of pH values, ionic strengths, and environmental conditions, making them suitable for both in vitro and intracellular temperature sensing (2). Furthermore, some studies also demonstrate the potential of carbon dots as dual-functional sensors, combining thermal sensing with other applications such as metal ion detection (3). Overall, these methodologies contribute to the research problem by providing accurate and reliable nanothermometers based on carbon dots, which can be used for various biomedical applications.

1087,Environmental Sciences,Earth Sciences,Predicting soil properties with Multiple Linear Regression (MLR),Spatial prediction of organic carbon in German agricultural topsoil using machine learning algorithms,"Abstract. As the largest terrestrial carbon pool, soil organic carbon (SOC) has the
potential to influence and mitigate climate change; thus, SOC monitoring is of high importance
in the frameworks of various international treaties. Therefore, high-resolution SOC maps are required. Machine learning (ML) offers new
opportunities to develop these maps due to its ability to data mine large
datasets. The aim of this study was to apply three algorithms commonly used
in digital soil mapping – random forest (RF), boosted regression trees
(BRT), and support vector machine for regression (SVR) – on the first German
agricultural soil inventory to model the agricultural topsoil (0–30 cm) SOC
content and develop a two-model approach to address the high variability in
SOC in German agricultural soils. Model performance is often limited by the
size and quality of the soil dataset available for calibration and
validation. Therefore, the impact of enlarging the training dataset was tested
by including data from the European Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey
for agricultural sites in Germany. Nested cross-validation was implemented
for model evaluation and parameter tuning. Grid search and the differential
evolution algorithm were also applied to ensure that each algorithm was
appropriately tuned . The SOC content of the German agricultural soil
inventory was highly variable, ranging from 4 to 480 g kg−1. However, only 4 % of all soils contained more than 87 g kg−1 SOC and were considered organic or degraded organic soils. The
results showed that SVR produced the best performance, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 32 g kg−1 when the algorithms were trained on the full dataset. However, the
average RMSE of all algorithms decreased by 34 % when mineral and organic
soils were modelled separately, with the best result from SVR presenting an RMSE of
21 g kg−1. The model performance was enhanced by up to 1 % for
mineral soils and by up to 2 % for organic soils. Despite the ability of machine
learning algorithms, in general, and SVR, in particular, to model SOC on a
national scale, the study showed that the most important aspect for
improving the model performance was to separate the modelling of mineral and
organic soils.",10.5194/soil-8-587-2022,Multivariate mapping of soil with structural equation modelling: Multivariate soil mapping using SEM,"In a previous study we introduced structural equation modelling (SEM) for digital soil mapping in the Argentine Pampas. An attractive property of SEM is that it incorporates pedological knowledge explicitly through a mathematical implementation of a conceptual model. Many soil processes operate within the soil profile; therefore, SEM might be suitable for simultaneous prediction of soil properties for multiple soil layers. In this way, relations between soil properties in different horizons can be included that might result in more consistent predictions. The objectives of this study were therefore to apply SEM to multi‐layer and multivariate soil mapping, and to test SEM functionality for suggestions to improve the modelling. We applied SEM to model and predict the lateral and vertical distribution of the cation exchange capacity (CEC), organic carbon (OC) and clay content of three major soil horizons, A, B and C, for a 23 000‐km2 region in the Argentine Pampas. We developed a conceptual model based on pedological hypotheses. Next, we derived a mathematical model and calibrated it with environmental covariates and soil data from 320 soil profiles. Cross‐validation of predicted soil properties showed that SEM explained only marginally more of the variance than a linear regression model. However, assessment of the covariation showed that SEM reproduces the covariance between variables much more accurately than linear regression. We concluded that SEM can be used to predict several soil properties in multiple layers by considering the interrelations between soil properties and layers.",10.1111/ejss.12446,Assessing soil organic carbon stocks under current and potential forest cover using digital soil mapping and spatial generalisation,"Forest soils are important components in the global C-cycle. Regional soil organic carbon (SOC) stock assessments are hampered by low spatial densities of routine soil inventories. In this study, we estimated the SOC stock in the upper meter of forest in the region of Flanders (N. Belgium) using four digital soil mapping techniques, i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR), boosted regression trees (BRT), artificial neural networks (ANN) and least-squares support vector machines (LS-SVM), and compared them with the results of a multi-level spatial generalisation (MLSG) approach.

Applied to a collection of 276 soil profiles, we identified the highest groundwater level, clay fraction, tree genus and soil type as key predictors of the SOC stock in the upper 100 cm under forests. Overall, BRT was the most informative as it obtained the best fit (training R2 of 0.68, cross-validated R2 of 0.22) and provided insights in the soil system by showing average predictor effects in partial dependence plots. With BRT, the total stock in the upper meter of forest soil (153,544 ha) was estimated to be 26.99 Mt OC, or 17.58 kg m−2 on average. MLSG provided an estimate for only 90% of the forest area and resulted in a larger average stock of 18.22 kg m−2 due to larger predictions for Histosols. As a null model, i.e. assuming that the potential natural dominant tree genus would occur according to the present soil conditions, the SOC stock in the current forest area was estimated at 30.00 Mt OC, or 21.26 kg OC m−2 on average. When the complete non-built-up territory (1,168,850 ha) would be forested analogously, 255.28 Mt OC would be stored, which is more than double the amount of predictions under the actual land cover. The results highlight the importance to conserve and restore carbon hotspots like alluvial forests. New soil inventories should focus on these and other data-scarce land units. Future modelling approaches can benefit from explicitly taking the soil type and tree genus into account as predictors.status: publishe",10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.02.010,Combining Variable Selection and Multiple Linear Regression for Soil Organic Matter and Total Nitrogen Estimation by DRIFT-MIR Spectroscopy,"The successful estimation of soil organic matter (SOM) and soil total nitrogen (TN) contents with mid-infrared (MIR) reflectance spectroscopy depends on selecting appropriate variable selection techniques and multivariate methods for regression analysis. This study aimed to explore the potential of combining a multivariate method and spectral variable selection for soil SOM and TN estimation using MIR spectroscopy. Five hundred and ten topsoil samples were collected from Quzhou County, Hebei Province, China, and their SOM and TN contents and reflectance spectra were measured using DRIFT-MIR spectroscopy (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform in the mid-infrared range, MIR, wavenumber: 4000–400 cm−1; wavelength: 2500–25,000 nm). Two multivariate methods (partial least-squares regression, PLSR; multiple linear regression, MLR) combined with two variable selection techniques (stability competitive adaptive reweighted sampling, sCARS; bootstrapping soft shrinkage approach, BOSS) were used for model calibration. The MLR model combined with the sCARS method yielded the most accurate estimation result for both SOM (Rp2 = 0.72 and RPD = 1.89) and TN (Rp2 = 0.84 and RPD = 2.50). Out of the 2382 wavenumbers in a full spectrum, sCARS determined that only 31 variables were important for SOM estimation (accounting for 1.30% of all variables) and 27 variables were important for TN estimation (accounting for 1.13% of all variables). The results demonstrated that sCARS was a highly efficient approach for extracting information on wavenumbers and mitigating redundant wavenumbers. In addition, the current study indicated that MLR, which is simpler than PLSR, when combined with spectral variable selection, can achieve high-precision prediction of SOM and TN content. As such, DRIFT-MIR spectroscopy coupled with MLR and sCARS is a good alternative for estimating the SOM and TN of soils.",10.3390/agronomy12030638,Multi-predictor mapping of soil organic carbon in the alpine tundra: a case study for the central Ecuadorian páramo,"Abstract
Background
Soil organic carbon (SOC) affects essential biological, biochemical, and physical soil functions such as nutrient cycling, water retention, water distribution, and soil structure stability. The Andean páramo known as such a high carbon and water storage capacity ecosystem is a complex, heterogeneous and remote ecosystem complicating field studies to collect SOC data. Here, we propose a multi-predictor remote quantification of SOC using Random Forest Regression to map SOC stock in the herbaceous páramo of the Chimborazo province, Ecuador.

Results
Spectral indices derived from the Landsat-8 (L8) sensors, OLI and TIRS, topographic, geological, soil taxonomy and climate variables were used in combination with 500 in situ SOC sampling data for training and calibrating a suitable predictive SOC model. The final predictive model selected uses nine predictors with a RMSE of 1.72% and a R2 of 0.82 for SOC expressed in weight %, a RMSE of 25.8 Mg/ha and a R2 of 0.77 for the model in units of Mg/ha. Satellite-derived indices such as VARIG, SLP, NDVI, NDWI, SAVI, EVI2, WDRVI, NDSI, NDMI, NBR and NBR2 were not found to be strong SOC predictors. Relevant predictors instead were in order of importance: geological unit, soil taxonomy, precipitation, elevation, orientation, slope length and steepness (LS Factor), Bare Soil Index (BI), average annual temperature and TOA Brightness Temperature.

Conclusions
Variables such as the BI index derived from satellite images and the LS factor from the DEM increase the SOC mapping accuracy. The mapping results show that over 57% of the study area contains high concentrations of SOC, between 150 and 205 Mg/ha, positioning the herbaceous páramo as an ecosystem of global importance. The results obtained with this study can be used to extent the SOC mapping in the whole herbaceous ecosystem of Ecuador offering an efficient and accurate methodology without the need for intensive in situ sampling.",10.1186/s13021-021-00195-2,"These abstracts describe various studies related to soil properties, including estimating soil organic carbon stocks using digital soil mapping techniques, assessing the relationship between soil exchange capacity and organic carbon content, developing a conceptual model for predicting soil properties using pedological hypotheses, and exploring the potential of combining variable selection and multiple linear regression for soil organic matter and total nitrogen estimation using mid-infrared reflectance spectroscopy. The studies highlight the importance of accurate soil property assessments for understanding ecosystem functions and informing land management decisions. They also demonstrate the potential of using various modeling techniques, such as digital soil mapping, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and multiple linear regression, to predict soil properties based on environmental covariates and spectral data.

This leads to challenges being encountered with some land covers classes, especially in wetlands classes. In this study, satellite images from the Sentinel 2B by ESA (European Space Agency) were used to classify the land cover of Al‑Hawizeh marsh/Iraq‑Iran border. Three classification methods were used aimed at comparing their accuracy, using multispectral satellite images with a spatial resolution of 10 m. The classification process was performed using three different algorithms, namely: Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The classification algorithms were carried out using ENVI 5.1 software to detect six land cover classes: deep water marsh, shallow water marsh, marsh vegetation (aquatic vegetation), urban area (built‑up area), agriculture area, and barren soil. The results showed that the MLC method applied to Sentinel 2B images provides a higher overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient compared to the ANN and SVM methods. Overall accuracy values for MLC, ANN, and SVM methods were 85.32%, 70.64%, and 77.01% respectively.",10.7494/geom.2021.15.1.5,Identification of Winter Land Use in Temperate Agricultural Landscapes based on Sentinel-1 and 2 Times-Series,"Land cover and land use monitoring, particularly during winter season, is still a major environmental and scientific issue in agricultural areas. From an environmental point of view, the presence and type of vegetation cover in winter have an impact on pollutant transport to water bodies. From a methodological point of view, characterizing spatio-temporal dynamics of winter land cover and land use at a field scale remains a challenge due to the diversity of farming strategies and practices. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of optical and SAR time-series to improve the monitoring of winter land use in an area of 130 km2. For that purpose, Sentinel-1 and 2 time-series were classified using SVM and RF algorithms. Winter land use was identified with an overall accuracy of 81% and a kappa index of 0.77 from a combination of Sentinel-1 and 2 images.",10.1109/igarss.2018.8517673,Land-Cover and Land-Use Classification Based on Multitemporal Sentinel-2 Data,"In this paper, we focus on the analysis of multitemporal Sentinel-2 data for land-cover and land-use classification. Given a set of representative training areas, we use a Random Forest classifier for the semantic labeling of the considered scene with respect to seven classes. As the classifier allows assessing the relevance of involved features for the classification task, we also estimate the relevance of the spectral channels for different dates. The derived results clearly reveal the benefit of a multitemporal analysis of Sentinel-2 data, since it also addresses seasonal changes in the acquired data.",10.1109/igarss.2018.8519301,Sentinel-2 Data for Land Use Mapping: Comparing Different Supervised Classifications in Semi-Arid Areas,"Mapping and monitoring land use (LU) changes is one of the most effective ways to understand and manage land transformation. The main objectives of this study were to classify LU using supervised classification methods and to assess the effectiveness of various machine learning methods. The current investigation was conducted in the Nord-Est area of Tunisia, and an optical satellite image covering the study area was acquired from Sentinel-2. For LU mapping, we tested three machine learning models algorithms: Random Forest (RF), K-Dimensional Trees K-Nearest Neighbors (KDTree-KNN) and Minimum Distance Classification (MDC). According to our research, the RF classification provided a better result than other classification models. RF classification exhibited the best values of overall accuracy, kappa, recall, precision and RMSE, with 99.54%, 0.98%, 0.98%, 0.98% and 0.23%, respectively. However, low precision was observed for the MDC method (RMSE = 1.15). The results were more intriguing since they highlighted the value of the bare soil index as a covariate for LU mapping. Our results suggest that Sentinel-2 combined with RF classification is efficient for creating a LU map.",10.3390/agriculture12091429,The effect of fusing Sentinel-2 bands on land-cover classification,"ABSTRACT The Sentinel-2 satellite currently provides freely available multispectral bands at relatively high spatial resolution but does not acquire the panchromatic band. To improve the resolution of 20 m bands to 10 m, existing pansharpening methods (Brovey transform [BT], intensity–hue–saturation [IHS], principal component analysis [PCA], the variational method [P + XS], and the wavelet method) required adjustment, which was achieved using higher resolution multispectral bands in the role of a panchromatic band to fuse bands at a lower spatial resolution. After preprocessing, six bands at lower resolution were divided into two groups because some image fusion methods (e.g. BT, IHS) are limited to a maximum of three input bands of a lower resolution at a time. With respect to the spectral range, the higher resolution band for the first group was synthesized from bands 4 and 8, and band 8 was selected for the second group. Given that one of the main remote sensing applications is land-cover classification, the classification accuracy of the fusion methods was assessed as well as the comparison with reference bands and pixels. The supervised classification methods were Maximum Likelihood Classifier, artificial neural networks, and object-based image analysis. The classification scheme contained five classes: water, built-up, bare soil, low vegetation, and forest. The results showed that most of the fusion methods, particularly P + XS and PCA, improved the overall classification accuracy, especially for the classes of forest, low vegetation, and bare soil and in the detection of coastlines. The least satisfying results were obtained from the wavelet method.",10.1080/01431161.2017.1392640,"In recent studies, researchers have explored using Sentinel-2 data for land use and land cover (LULC) mapping. Three methods were compared in the first study for mapping LULC in marshland areas using Sentinel-2 images from the European Space Agency (ESA). Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms were employed, with MLC providing a higher overall accuracy and kappa coefficient than ANN and SVM (1).

Another study focused on identifying winter land use in agricultural landscapes using Sentinel-1 and 2 time-series. Combining Sentinel-1 and 2 images, the researchers achieved an overall accuracy of 81% and a kappa index of 0.77 for winter land use identification (2).

A third study emphasized the benefits of multitemporal Sentinel-2 data analysis for LULC classification. Using a Random Forest classifier, the study revealed that assessing the relevance of spectral channels for different dates significantly improved the accuracy of LULC mapping (3).

The fourth study compared various supervised classification methods using Sentinel-2 data in semi-arid areas. The Random Forest (RF) classification method outperformed other models, providing the best overall accuracy, kappa, recall, precision, and RMSE values for land use mapping (4).

Lastly, a study investigated the effect of fusing Sentinel-2 bands on LULC classification. Using various pansharpening methods, the results showed that most fusion methods improved overall classification accuracy, particularly for forest, low vegetation, and bare soil classes, while the least satisfying results were obtained from the wavelet method (5).

We specifically focus on the role of day care center and school closures, which may be regarded as a “disruptive exogenous shock” to family life. We make use of a novel representative survey of parental well-being collected in May and June 2020 in Germany, when schools and day care centers were closed but while other measures had been relaxed and new infections were low. In our descriptive analysis, we compare well-being during this period with a pre-crisis period for different groups. In a difference-in-differences design, we compare the change for individuals with children to the change for individuals without children, accounting for unrelated trends as well as potential survey mode and context effects. We find that the crisis lowered the relative well-being of individuals with children, especially for individuals with young children, for women, and for persons with lower secondary schooling qualifications. Our results suggest that public policy measures taken to contain Covid-19 can have large effects on family well-being, with implications for child development and parental labor market outcomes.",10.1007/s11150-020-09529-4,Individual differences and changes in subjective wellbeing during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has considerably impacted many people's lives. This study examined changes in subjective wellbeing between December 2019 and May 2020 and how stress appraisals and coping strategies relate to individual differences and changes in subjective wellbeing during the early stages of the pandemic. Data were collected at 4 time points from 979 individuals in Germany. Results showed that, on average, life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect did not change significantly between December 2019 and March 2020 but decreased between March and May 2020. Across the latter timespan, individual differences in life satisfaction were positively related to controllability appraisals, active coping, and positive reframing, and negatively related to threat and centrality appraisals and planning. Positive affect was positively related to challenge and controllable-by-self appraisals, active coping, using emotional support, and religion, and negatively related to threat appraisal and humor. Negative affect was positively related to threat and centrality appraisals, denial, substance use, and self-blame, and negatively related to controllability appraisals and emotional support. Contrary to expectations, the effects of stress appraisals and coping strategies on changes in subjective wellbeing were small and mostly nonsignificant. These findings imply that the COVID-19 pandemic represents not only a major medical and economic crisis, but also has a psychological dimension, as it can be associated with declines in key facets of people's subjective wellbeing. Psychological practitioners should address potential declines in subjective wellbeing with their clients and attempt to enhance clients' general capability to use functional stress appraisals and effective coping strategies.

The data is from 2 surveys of 1,143 adults from RAND Corporation's nationally representative American Life Panel, the first administered between April-June, 2019 and the second during the initial peak of the pandemic in the United States in April, 2020. Depressive symptoms during the pandemic were higher than population norms before the pandemic. Depressive symptoms increased from before to during COVID-19 and life satisfaction decreased. Individuals with higher education experienced a greater increase in depressive symptoms and a greater decrease in life satisfaction from before to during COVID-19 in comparison to those with lower education. Supplemental analysis illustrates that income had a curvilinear relationship with changes in well-being, such that individuals at the highest levels of income experienced a greater decrease in life satisfaction from before to during COVID-19 than individuals with lower levels of income. We draw on conservation of resources theory and the theory of fundamental social causes to examine four key mechanisms (perceived financial resources, perceived control, interpersonal resources, and COVID-19-related knowledge/news consumption) underlying the relationship between SES and well-being during COVID-19.

Objectives
To investigate early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic related to (a) levels of worry, risk perception, and social distancing; (b) longitudinal effects on well-being; and (c) effects of worry, risk perception, and social distancing on well-being.


Methods
We analyzed annual changes in four aspects of well-being over 5 years (2015–2020): life satisfaction, financial satisfaction, self-rated health, and loneliness in a subsample (n = 1,071, aged 65–71) from a larger survey of Swedish older adults. The 2020 wave, collected March 26–April 2, included measures of worry, risk perception, and social distancing in response to COVID-19.


Results
(a) In relation to COVID-19: 44.9% worried about health, 69.5% about societal consequences, 25.1% about financial consequences; 86.4% perceived a high societal risk, 42.3% a high risk of infection, and 71.2% reported high levels of social distancing. (b) Well-being remained stable (life satisfaction and loneliness) or even increased (self-rated health and financial satisfaction) in 2020 compared to previous years. (c) More worry about health and financial consequences was related to lower scores in all four well-being measures. Higher societal worry and more social distancing were related to higher well-being.


Discussion
In the early stage of the pandemic, Swedish older adults on average rated their well-being as high as, or even higher than, previous years. However, those who worried more reported lower well-being. Our findings speak to the resilience, but also heterogeneity, among older adults during the pandemic. Further research, on a broad range of health factors and long-term psychological consequences, is needed.",10.1093/geronb/gbaa084,"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted individuals' well-being across various sociodemographic groups and contexts. Three studies from Germany and the United States provide insights into this issue by examining changes in subjective well-being and its determinants during the early stages of the pandemic (Studies 1, 3, and 5).

In Study 1, researchers investigated worry, risk perception, social distancing, and their effects on well-being among Swedish older adults. They found that while overall well-being remained stable or even improved in 2020 compared to previous years, those who reported more worry about health and financial consequences experienced lower well-being (Study 5).

Another study from the United States focused on mental health during state-wide lockdowns, revealing a significant negative impact on mental health overall, with women being disproportionately affected (Study 4).

A third study examined changes in depressive symptoms and life satisfaction among individuals in the United States by socioeconomic status (SES) before and during the pandemic. Results showed that individuals with higher education experienced a greater increase in depressive symptoms and decrease in life satisfaction compared to those with lower education (Study 3).

Additionally, Study 2 from the United States investigated gender differences in mental health impacts of lockdown measures, revealing a larger negative effect on women's mental health.

These studies highlight the importance of understanding the complex relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and well-being across various populations and contexts. Further research is needed to explore long-term psychological consequences and a broader range of health factors.",4,,4,,5,,5,,3,,4,,4,,2,,2,,4,,4,,5,,4,,4,,3,,4,,5,,2,,2,none,1,multiple serious inaccuracies,2,none,2,none,3,none,4,none,2,none,4,none,2,none
1151,Computational Linguistics,Linguistics,Multilingual named entity recognition,Multilingual named entity recognition using parallel data and metadata from wikipedia,In this paper we propose a method to automatically label multi-lingual data with named entity tags. We build on prior work utilizing Wikipedia metadata and show how to effectively combine the weak annotations stemming from Wikipedia metadata with information obtained through English-foreign language parallel Wikipedia sentences. The combination is achieved using a novel semi-CRF model for foreign sentence tagging in the context of a parallel English sentence. The model outperforms both standard annotation projection methods and methods based solely on Wikipedia metadata.,,Named Entity Recognition in Wikipedia,"Named entity recognition (NER) is used in many domains beyond the newswire text that comprises current gold-standard corpora. Recent work has used Wikipedia's link structure to automatically generate near gold-standard annotations. Until now, these resources have only been evaluated on newswire corpora or themselves. 
 
We present the first NER evaluation on a Wikipedia gold standard (WG) corpus. Our analysis of cross-corpus performance on WG shows that Wikipedia text may be a harder NER domain than newswire. We find that an automatic annotation of Wikipedia has high agreement with WG and, when used as training data, outperforms newswire models by up to 7.7%.",,WEXEA: Wikipedia EXhaustive Entity Annotation,"Building predictive models for information extraction from text, such as named entity recognition or the extraction of semantic relationships between named entities in text, requires a large corpus of annotated text. Wikipedia is often used as a corpus for these tasks where the annotation is a named entity linked by a hyperlink to its article. However, editors on Wikipedia are only expected to link these mentions in order to help the reader to understand the content, but are discouraged from adding links that do not add any benefit for understanding an article. Therefore, many mentions of popular entities (such as countries or popular events in history), or previously linked articles, as well as the article’s entity itself, are not linked. In this paper, we discuss WEXEA, a Wikipedia EXhaustive Entity Annotation system, to create a text corpus based on Wikipedia with exhaustive annotations of entity mentions, i.e. linking all mentions of entities to their corresponding articles. This results in a huge potential for additional annotations that can be used for downstream NLP tasks, such as Relation Extraction. We show that our annotations are useful for creating distantly supervised datasets for this task. Furthermore, we publish all code necessary to derive a corpus from a raw Wikipedia dump, so that it can be reproduced by everyone.",,Mining Wiki Resources for Multilingual Named Entity Recognition,"In this paper, we describe a system by which the multilingual characteristics of Wikipedia can be utilized to annotate a large corpus of text with Named Entity Recognition (NER) tags requiring minimal human intervention and no linguistic expertise. This process, though of value in languages for which resources exist, is particularly useful for less commonly taught languages. We show how the Wikipedia format can be used to identify possible named entities and discuss in detail the process by which we use the Category structure inherent to Wikipedia to determine the named entity type of a proposed entity. We further describe the methods by which English language data can be used to bootstrap the NER process in other languages. We demonstrate the system by using the generated corpus as training sets for a variant of BBN's Identifinder in French, Ukrainian, Spanish, Polish, Russian, and Portuguese, achieving overall F-scores as high as 84.7% on independent, human-annotated corpora, comparable to a system trained on up to 40,000 words of human-annotated newswire.",,WikiNEuRal: Combined Neural and Knowledge-based Silver Data Creation for Multilingual NER,"Multilingual Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key intermediate task which is needed in many areas of NLP. In this paper, we address the well-known issue of data scarcity in NER, especially relevant when moving to a multilingual scenario, and go beyond current approaches to the creation of multilingual silver data for the task. We exploit the texts of Wikipedia and introduce a new methodology based on the effective combination of knowledge-based approaches and neural models, together with a novel domain adaptation technique, to produce high-quality training corpora for NER. We evaluate our datasets extensively on standard benchmarks for NER, yielding substantial improvements of up to 6 span-based F1-score points over previous state-of-the-art systems for data creation.",10.18653/v1/2021.findings-emnlp.215,"This synthesis focuses on multilingual named entity recognition (NER) methods presented in five research papers. Paper one proposes a method using Wikipedia metadata and parallel sentences to label multi-lingual data with named entity tags, outperforming standard annotation projection methods and those based solely on Wikipedia metadata (1). Paper two evaluates NER performance on Wikipedia gold standard (WG) corpus, revealing its challenges compared to newswire text and demonstrating the effectiveness of automatic annotations in improving model performance (2).

Papers three and five introduce systems, WEXEA and WikiNEuRal, respectively, for creating exhaustive entity annotations on Wikipedia. WEXEA aims to link all mentions of entities to their corresponding articles, resulting in a large corpus for downstream NLP tasks like relation extraction (3). WikiNEuRal combines knowledge-based approaches and neural models with domain adaptation techniques to generate high-quality multilingual silver data for NER, yielding substantial improvements over previous state-of-the-art systems (5).

Paper four describes a system utilizing Wikipedia's Category structure to identify possible named entities and determine their types, requiring minimal human intervention and no linguistic expertise. It demonstrates the system's effectiveness by achieving high F-scores in various languages using the generated corpus as training sets for Identifinder (4). Overall, these studies contribute to advancing multilingual NER through innovative methods leveraging Wikipedia resources.

1152,First/Second Language Acquisition,Linguistics,Effects of the violation of joint attention on mapping processes,Learning words in nonostensive contexts.,"Four word learning studies with 24-month-old children are reported. In Studies 1 and 2, an adult used a novel word to announce her intention to perform an action or to find an object. It was found that a knowledge of what action or object was impending ― established through scripted events before the word's introduction ― was not necessary for children to learn the words. Studies 3 and 4 focused on what word learning cues children might be using in these contexts. In Study 3, it was found that children learned a novel verb for an intentional and not an accidental action. In Study 4, it was found that children learned a novel noun for an object the adult was searching for, not ones she had rejected while searching",10.1037/0012-1649.30.5.639,Two-year-olds learn words for absent objects and actions,"Two studies of word learning in 24-month-old children are reported, one involving an object word (Study 1) and one involving an action word (Study 2). In both studies, non-verbal scripts of playing with novel objects/actions in particular ways were established before the child was exposed to any language models. Following this pre-training, children heard an experimenter announce her intention to either find an object or perform an action. In the referent condition, children then saw the intended referent (object or action) immediately after hearing the language model. Children in the absent referent condition experienced the same non-verbal scripts and language models, but never saw the referent object or action after hearing the language model: at the appropriate juncture in the script they were told that the toy barn in which the target object had been previously located was “locked”, or that the toy character who had previously performed the target action was missing. Comparisons with two control conditions indicated that children were able to learn words for a novel object and a novel action in both the referent and absent referent conditions and, moreover, that learning was equivalent in these two conditions. These results show quite clearly that early lexical acquisition does not depend on temporal contiguity between word and referent—or indeed any perceptual pairing between word and referent at all—but rather it relies on children's active understandings of a speaker's referential intentions in particular discourse contexts.",10.1111/j.2044-835x.1996.tb00695.x,Phonotactic Constraints on Infant Word Learning: PHONOTACTIC CONSTRAINTS ON INFANT WORD LEARNING,"How do infants use their knowledge of native language sound patterns when learning words? There is ample evidence of infants' precocious acquisition of native language sound structure during the first years of life, but much less evidence concerning how they apply this knowledge to the task of associating sounds with meanings in word learning. To address this question, 18-month-olds were presented with two phonotactically legal object labels (containing sound sequences that occur frequently in English) or two phonotactically illegal object labels (containing sound sequences that never occur in English), paired with novel objects. Infants were then tested using a looking-while-listening measure. The results revealed that infants looked at the correct objects after hearing the legal labels, but not the illegal labels. Furthermore, vocabulary size was related to performance. Infants with larger receptive vocabularies displayed greater differences between learning of legal and illegal labels than infants with smaller vocabularies. These findings provide evidence that infants' knowledge of native language sound patterns influences their word learning.",10.1111/j.1532-7078.2010.00046.x,The Interplay of Cross-Situational Word Learning and Sentence-Level Constraints,"A variety of mechanisms contribute to word learning. Learners can track co-occurring words and referents across situations in a bottom-up manner (cross-situational word learning, CSWL). Equally, they can exploit sentential contexts, relying on top-down information such as verb-argument relations and world knowledge, offering immediate constraints on meaning (word learning based on sentence-level constraints, SLCL). When combined, CSWL and SLCL potentially modulate each other's influence, revealing how word learners deal with multiple mechanisms simultaneously: Do they use all mechanisms? Prefer one? Is their strategy context dependent? Three experiments conducted with adult learners reveal that learners prioritize SLCL over CSWL. CSWL is applied in addition to SLCL only if SLCL is not perfectly disambiguating, thereby complementing or competing with it. These studies demonstrate the importance of investigating word-learning mechanisms simultaneously, revealing important characteristics of their interaction in more naturalistic learning environments.",10.1111/cogs.12178,Infants' ability to consult the speaker for clues to word reference,"ABSTRACTThis research examines whether infants actively seek information from a speaker regarding the referent of the speaker's utterance. Forty-eight infants (in three age groups: 1;2–1;3, 1;4–1;5, and 1;6–1;7) heard novel labels for novel objects in two situations: follow-in labelling (the experimenter looked at and labelled the toy of the infant's focus) vs. discrepant labelling (the experimenter looked at and labelled a different toy than that of the infant's focus). Subsequently, half of the infants were asked comprehension questions (e.g. ‘Where's the peri?’). The other half were asked preference questions (e.g. ‘Where's the one you like?’), to ensure that their comprehension performance was not merely the result of preferential responding. The comprehension results revealed developmental change in both (a) infants' ability to establish new word-object mappings (infants aged 1;2–1;3 failed to establish stable word-object links even in follow-in labelling), and (b) infants' ability to pinpoint the correct referent during discrepant labelling (only infants aged 1;6–1;7 succeeded). Thus the period between 1;2 and 1;7 represents a time of change in infants' ability to establish new word-object mappings: infants are becoming increasingly adept at acquiring new labels under minimal learning conditions.",10.1017/s0305000900008345,"In a series of studies, researchers explored the effects of joint attention violation on mapping processes during early word learning (1, 2). Studies 1 and 2 from paper 1 demonstrated that children could learn novel words in non-ostensive contexts without requiring temporal contiguity or perceptual pairing between word and referent (1). Meanwhile, studies in paper 2 showed that children were able to learn words for absent objects and actions based on the speaker's referential intentions (2).

Paper 3 provided evidence that infants' knowledge of native language sound patterns influences their word learning through phonotactic constraints (3). Infants displayed greater differences in learning legal versus illegal labels, with larger vocabularies leading to better performance.

Study findings from paper 4 revealed that learners prioritize sentence-level constraints over cross-situational word learning but apply the latter when necessary for disambiguation (4). These studies emphasized the importance of investigating multiple mechanisms in naturalistic learning environments.

Lastly, research in paper 5 examined infants' ability to consult a speaker for clues regarding referents and revealed developmental changes in their ability to establish new word-object mappings between 1;2 and 1;7 (5). Infants aged 1;2–1;3 struggled with establishing stable word-object links, while those aged 1;6–1;7 successfully identified the correct referent during discrepant labeling.

In summary, these studies collectively demonstrate that children's early word learning is not dependent on temporal contiguity or perceptual pairing between words and referents (1, 2). Instead, they rely on their understanding of a speaker's intentions in specific contexts and their knowledge of native language sound patterns to learn new words (1-3).",3,,2,,4,,4,,4,"The materials are skillfully combined, making use of the right markers and connectors to weave a coherent story.

In addition, we introduce FairAccess as a fully decentralized pseudonymous and privacy preserving authorization management framework that enables users to own and control their data. To implement our model, we use and adapt the blockchain into a decentralized access control manager.

We make use of the cloud storage scenario and choose the cloud file as a data unit to detect user operations for collecting provenance data.

Various studies on optimization of black phosphorus field-effect transistors, PN junctions, photodetectors, and other applications have been demonstrated. Although chemical sensing based on black phosphorus devices was theoretically predicted, there is still no experimental verification of such an important study of this material. In this article, we report on chemical sensing of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) using field-effect transistors based on multilayer black phosphorus. Black phosphorus sensors exhibited increased conduction upon NO2 exposure and excellent sensitivity for detection of NO2 down to 5 ppb. Moreover, when the multilayer black phosphorus field-effect transistor was exposed to NO2 concentrations of 5, 10, 20, and 40 ppb, its relative conduction change followed the Langmuir isotherm for molecules adsorbed on a surface. Additionally, on the basis of an exponential conductance change, the rate constants for adsorption and desorption of NO2 on black phosphorus were extracted for different NO2 concentrations, and they were in the range of 130-840 s.

The resulting neck-width of the synthesized nanomesh was about ∼20 nm and was comprised of the gap between polystyrene (PS) spheres that was formed during the reactive ion etching (RIE) process. The neck-width and the periodicities of the graphene nanomesh (GNM) could be easily controlled depending on the duration/power of the RIE and the size of the PS nanospheres. The fabricated GNM transistor device exhibited promising electronic properties featuring a high drive current and an I(ON)/I(OFF) ratio of about 6, significantly higher than its film counterpart. Similarly, when applied as a chemiresistor gas sensor at room temperature, the graphene nanomesh sensor showed excellent sensitivity toward NO(2) and NH(3), significantly higher than their film counterparts.

However, there are still significant challenges for NO2 sensing at low detection limits, especially in the presence of other interfering gases. The NO2 selectivity of current gas-sensing technologies is significantly traded-off with their sensitivity and reversibility as well as fabrication and operating costs. In this work, we present an important progress for selective and reversible NO2 sensing by demonstrating an economical sensing platform based on the charge transfer between physisorbed NO2 gas molecules and two-dimensional (2D) tin disulfide (SnS2) flakes at low operating temperatures. The device shows high sensitivity and superior selectivity to NO2 at operating temperatures of less than 160 °C, which are well below those of chemisorptive and ion conductive NO2 sensors with much poorer selectivity. At the same time, excellent reversibility of the sensor is demonstrated, which has rarely been observed in other 2D material counterparts. Such impressive features originate from the planar morphology of 2D SnS2 as well as unique physical affinity and favorable electronic band positions of this material that facilitate the NO2 physisorption and charge transfer at parts per billion levels. The 2D SnS2-based sensor provides a real solution for low-cost and selective NO2 gas sensing.",10.1021/acsnano.5b04343,Sensing Behavior of Atomically Thin-Layered MoS2 Transistors,"Most of recent research on layered chalcogenides is understandably focused on single atomic layers.

To probe this issue further, we have prepared large-area MoS2 sheets ranging from single to multiple layers on 300 nm SiO2/Si substrates using the micromechanical exfoliation method. The thickness and layering of the sheets were identified by optical microscope, invoking recently reported specific optical color contrast, and further confirmed by AFM and Raman spectroscopy. The MoS2 transistors with different thicknesses were assessed for gas-sensing performances with exposure to NO2, NH3, and humidity in different conditions such as gate bias and light irradiation. The results show that, compared to the single-layer counterpart, transistors of few MoS2 layers exhibit excellent sensitivity, recovery, and ability to be manipulated by gate bias and green light.

The proportion of problem solving participants depressed at six months was 17% less than that for controls, giving a number needed to treat of 6; the mean difference in Beck depression inventory score was −2.63 (95% confidence interval −4.95 to −0.32), and there were significant improvements in SF-36 scores. For depression prevention, the difference in proportions of depressed participants was 14% (number needed to treat of 7); the mean difference in Beck depression inventory score was −1.50 (−4.16 to 1.17), and there were significant improvements in SF-36 scores. Such differences were not observed at 12 months. Neither specific diagnosis nor treatment with antidepressants affected outcome. Conclusions: When offered to adults with depressive disorders in the community, problem solving treatment was more acceptable than the course on prevention of depression. Both interventions reduced caseness and improved subjective function.",10.1136/bmj.321.7274.1450,Randomised controlled trial comparing problem solving treatment with amitriptyline and placebo for major depression in primary care,"Abstract Objective: To determine whether, in the treatment of major depression in primary care, a brief psychological treatment (problem solving) was (a) as effective as antidepressant drugs and more effective than placebo; (b) feasible in practice; and (c) acceptable to patients. Design: Randomised controlled trial of problem solving treatment, amitriptyline plus standard clinical management, and drug placebo plus standard clinical management. Each treatment was delivered in six sessions over 12 weeks. Setting: Primary care in Oxfordshire. Subjects: 91 patients in primary care who had major depression. Main outcome measures: Observer and self reported measures of severity of depression, self reported measure of social outcome, and observer measure of psychological symptoms at six and 12 weeks; self reported measure of patient satisfaction at 12 weeks. Numbers of patients recovered at six and 12 weeks. Results: At six and 12 weeks the difference in score on the Hamilton rating scale for depression between problem solving and placebo treatments was significant (5.3 (95% confidence interval 1.6 to 9.0) and 4.7 (0.4 to 9.0) respectively), but the difference between problem solving and amitriptyline was not significant (1.8 (−1.8 to 5.5) and 0.9 (−3.3 to 5.2) respectively). At 12 weeks 60% (18/30) of patients given problem solving treatment had recovered on the Hamilton scale compared with 52% (16/31) given amitriptyline and 27% (8/30) given placebo. Patients were satisfied with problem solving treatment; all patients who completed treatment (28/30) rated the treatment as helpful or very helpful. The six sessions of problem solving treatment totalled a mean therapy time of 3 1/2 hours. Conclusions: As a treatment for major depression in primary care, problem solving treatment is effective, feasible, and acceptable to patients. Key messages Key messages Patient compliance with antidepressant treatment is often poor, so there is a need for a psychological treatment This study found that problem solving is an effective psychological treatment for major depression in primary care—as effective as amitriptyline and more effective than placebo Problem solving is a feasible treatment in primary care, being effective when given over six sessions by a general practitioner Problem solving treatment is acceptable to patients",10.1136/bmj.310.6977.441,Telephone psychotherapy and telephone care management for primary care patients starting antidepressant treatment: a randomized controlled trial,"CONTEXT
Both antidepressant medication and structured psychotherapy have been proven efficacious, but less than one third of people with depressive disorders receive effective levels of either treatment.


OBJECTIVE
To compare usual primary care for depression with 2 intervention programs: telephone care management and telephone care management plus telephone psychotherapy.


DESIGN
Three-group randomized controlled trial with allocation concealment and blinded outcome assessment conducted between November 2000 and May 2002.


SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS
A total of 600 patients beginning antidepressant treatment for depression were systematically sampled from 7 group-model primary care clinics; patients already receiving psychotherapy were excluded.


INTERVENTIONS
Usual primary care; usual care plus a telephone care management program including at least 3 outreach calls, feedback to the treating physician, and care coordination; usual care plus care management integrated with a structured 8-session cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy program delivered by telephone.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Blinded telephone interviews at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months assessed depression severity (Hopkins Symptom Checklist Depression Scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire), patient-rated improvement, and satisfaction with treatment. Computerized administrative data examined use of antidepressant medication and outpatient visits.


RESULTS
Treatment participation rates were 97% for telephone care management and 93% for telephone care management plus psychotherapy. Compared with usual care, the telephone psychotherapy intervention led to lower mean Hopkins Symptom Checklist Depression Scale depression scores (P =.02), a higher proportion of patients reporting that depression was ""much improved"" (80% vs 55%, P<.001), and a higher proportion of patients ""very satisfied"" with depression treatment (59% vs 29%, P<.001). The telephone care management program had smaller effects on patient-rated improvement (66% vs 55%, P =.04) and satisfaction (47% vs 29%, P =.001); effects on mean depression scores were not statistically significant.


CONCLUSIONS
For primary care patients beginning antidepressant treatment, a telephone program integrating care management and structured cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy can significantly improve satisfaction and clinical outcomes. These findings suggest a new public health model of psychotherapy for depression including active outreach and vigorous efforts to improve access to and motivation for treatment.",10.1001/jama.292.8.935,Telephone-based treatment for family practice patients with mild depression,"The need for treating milder forms of depression has recently been of increased interest. This was a randomized, controlled study to evaluate the effects of telephone-based problem-solving therapy for mild depression. Comparison groups were a treatment-as-usual group and another group receiving stress-management training by telephone. From 1,742 family practice patients screened for depression, 54 with mild depression entered the study. Treatment was provided by experienced family practice nurses, trained and supervised in the treatments. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was administered before and after the intervention period, and the Beck Depression Inventory and Duke Health Profile were administered at the end of the intervention period. Of the 36 subjects assigned to the problem-solving and stress-management groups, half dropped out early in the study. Five from the treatment-as-usual group were lost to follow-up. In the remaining subjects, there was a significant decrease in depression scores. There were no significant differences in the amount of decrease between the groups on any scores. The small sample and high dropout rate limit the interpretation of the findings. However, since all subjects tended to improve, regardless of treatment received, mild levels of depression may generally remit even without focal intervention, and watchful waiting may be a reasonable alternative for management.",10.2466/pr0.94.3.785-792,Acute and one-year outcome of a randomised controlled trial of brief cognitive therapy for major depressive disorder in primary care,"BackgroundThe consensus statement on the treatment of depression (Paykel & Priest, 1992) advocates the use of cognitive therapy techniques as an adjunct to medication.MethodThis paper describes a randomised controlled trial of brief cognitive therapy (BCT) plus ‘treatment as usual’ versus treatment as usual in the management of 48 patients with major depressive disorder presenting in primary care.ResultsAt the end of the acute phase, significantly more subjects (P < 0.05) met recovery criteria in the intervention group (n=15) compared with the control group (n=8). When initial neuroticism scores were controlled for, reductions in Beck Depression Inventory and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores favoured the BCT group throughout the 12 months of follow-up.ConclusionsBCT may be beneficial, but given the time constraints, therapists need to be more rather than less skilled in cognitive therapy. This, plus methodological limitations, leads us to advise caution before applying this approach more widely in primary care.",10.1192/bjp.171.2.131,"These studies suggest that psychological interventions such as problem solving treatment and cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy delivered through telephone can be effective for major depression in primary care settings. Telephone interventions can improve patient satisfaction, clinical outcomes, and motivation for treatment. However, it is important to note that some studies have a high dropout rate and small sample sizes, which limit the interpretation of findings. Overall, these studies suggest that telephone-based interventions could be a valuable addition to usual primary care for depression, particularly for those with milder forms of depression or those who may not respond well to antidepressant medication alone. Further research is needed to determine the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these interventions in larger and more diverse populations.",4,,4,,3,,3,,4,,3,,3,,5,,3,,2,,2,,1,,3,,2,,3,,3,,4,,3,,1,none,3,none,1,none,2,none,1,none,2,none,4,none,2,none,5,none

We present mBART—a sequence-to-sequence denoising auto-encoder pre-trained on large-scale monolingual corpora in many languages using the BART objective (Lewis et al., 2019 ). mBART is the first method for pre-training a complete sequence-to-sequence model by denoising full texts in multiple languages, whereas previous approaches have focused only on the encoder, decoder, or reconstructing parts of the text. Pre-training a complete model allows it to be directly fine-tuned for supervised (both sentence-level and document-level) and unsupervised machine translation, with no task- specific modifications. We demonstrate that adding mBART initialization produces performance gains in all but the highest-resource settings, including up to 12 BLEU points for low resource MT and over 5 BLEU points for many document-level and unsupervised models. We also show that it enables transfer to language pairs with no bi-text or that were not in the pre-training corpus, and present extensive analysis of which factors contribute the most to effective pre-training. 1",10.1162/tacl_a_00343,Big Bird: Transformers for Longer Sequences,"Transformers-based models, such as BERT, have been one of the most successful deep learning models for NLP. Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having $O(1)$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also propose novel applications to genomics data.",,"BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension","We present BART, a denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence models. BART is trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture which, despite its simplicity, can be seen as generalizing BERT (due to the bidirectional encoder), GPT (with the left-to-right decoder), and other recent pretraining schemes. We evaluate a number of noising approaches, finding the best performance by both randomly shuffling the order of sentences and using a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token. BART is particularly effective when fine tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa on GLUE and SQuAD, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 3.5 ROUGE. BART also provides a 1.1 BLEU increase over a back-translation system for machine translation, with only target language pretraining. We also replicate other pretraining schemes within the BART framework, to understand their effect on end-task performance.",10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.703,GLIDE: Towards Photorealistic Image Generation and Editing with Text-Guided Diffusion Models,"Diffusion models have recently been shown to generate high-quality synthetic images, especially when paired with a guidance technique to trade off diversity for fidelity. We explore diffusion models for the problem of text-conditional image synthesis and compare two different guidance strategies: CLIP guidance and classifier-free guidance. We find that the latter is preferred by human evaluators for both photorealism and caption similarity, and often produces photorealistic samples. Samples from a 3.5 billion parameter text-conditional diffusion model using classifier-free guidance are favored by human evaluators to those from DALL-E, even when the latter uses expensive CLIP reranking. Additionally, we find that our models can be fine-tuned to perform image inpainting, enabling powerful text-driven image editing. We train a smaller model on a filtered dataset and release the code and weights at https://github.com/openai/glide-text2im.",10.48550/arXiv.2112.10741,Switch Transformers: Scaling to Trillion Parameter Models with Simple and Efficient Sparsity,"In deep learning, models typically reuse the same parameters for all inputs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models defy this and instead select diﬀerent parameters for each incoming example. The result is a sparsely-activated model—with an outrageous number of parameters—but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs, and training instability. We address these with the introduction of the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques mitigate the instabilities, and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the ﬁrst time, with lower precision (bﬂoat16) formats. We design models based oﬀ T5-Base and T5-Large (Raﬀel et al., 2019) to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the “Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus”, and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model. 1 present in each. These benchmarks consist of tasks requiring sentiment analysis (SST-2), word sense disambiguation (WIC), sentence similarty (MRPC, STS-B, QQP), natural language inference (MNLI, QNLI, RTE, CB), question answering (MultiRC, RECORD, BoolQ), coreference resolution (WNLI, WSC) and sentence completion (COPA) and sentence acceptability (CoLA). The CNNDM (Hermann et al., 2015) and BBC XSum (Narayan et al., 2018) data sets are used to measure the ability to summarize articles. Question answering is probed with the SQuAD data set (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) and the ARC Reasoning Challenge (Clark et al., 2018). And as in Roberts et al. (2020), we evaluate the knowledge of our models by ﬁne-tuning on three closed-book question answering data sets: Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), Web Questions (Berant et al., 2013) and Trivia QA (Joshi et al., 2017). Closed-book refers to questions posed with no supplemental reference or context material. To gauge the model’s common sense reasoning we evaluate it on the Winogrande Schema Challenge (Sakaguchi et al., 2020). And ﬁnally, we test our model’s natural language inference capabilities on the Adversarial NLI Benchmark (Nie et al., 2019). embeddings based on the incoming token representations to a given layer. Our work studies a speciﬁc model in a class of methods that do conditional computation, where computation decisions are made dynamically based on the input. Cho and Bengio (2014) proposed adaptively selecting weights based on certain bit patterns occuring in the model hidden-states. Eigen et al. (2013) built stacked expert layers with dense matrix multiplications and ReLU activations and showed promising results on jittered MNIST and monotone speech. In computer vision Puigcerver et al. (2020) manually route tokens based on semantic classes during upstream pre-training and then select the relevant experts to be used according to the downstream task.",,"This paper presents five different research projects conducted by OpenAI, a leading artificial intelligence research laboratory.
