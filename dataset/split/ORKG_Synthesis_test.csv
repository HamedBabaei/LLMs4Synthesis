1003,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics",Physics,UV Visible spectroscopy in highly charged ions (HCI),"Visible spectrum of highly charged ions: The forbidden optical lines of Kr, Xe, and Ba ions in  the Ar I to Kr I isoelectronic sequence","We present experimental data on visible transitions in highly charged ions observed in the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) electron beam ion traps, including results from lines within the ground-state configuration and the first excited configuration. Measurements of lines produced by Kr (q = 11+ to 22+), Xe (q = 18+ to 35+), and Ba (q = 28+ to 36+) ions, corresponding mainly to 3sl 3pm 3dn configurations, were carried out. The ionization stages were determined experimentally by sweeping the electron beam energy over the ionization threshold of each species. We propose possible identifications for the lines with the help of simple atomic structure calculations. However, most observed lines remained unidentified, demonstrating that the understanding of visible spectra from highly charged ions, even if obtained under nearly ""ideal"" experimental conditions, is still in its infancy. These spectral data may be useful for the diagnostics of magnetically confined plasmas and may set the stage for future measurements of radiative lifetimes. In our experiments, we used the emission from visible lines to image the intersection of the electron beam with a beam of neutral atoms injected into the trap at a right angle as well as the ion cloud in the trap. Under some conditions, the diameter of the ion cloud may be an order of magnitude larger than that of the electron beam.

This fills in a gap in previous measurements along this isoelectronic sequence, as well as extending previous work to the highest Z yet. With the addition of our results, measurements of this line now cover a sufficient range of Z to allow an interpolation of reliable wavelength estimates for the unmeasured members of the isoelectronic sequence from Z=52 to 83. We provide a table of these wavelengths for each member of the sequence in this range, and compare the measured wavelengths to recent calculations. Our results show that a long-standing discrepancy between prediction and experiment disappears in the high-Z limit.

The accuracy achieved in such experiments has been central to the study of nuclear size effects and quantum electrodynamic contributions, which are drastically magnified in highly charged ions, thus enabling the study of the underlying fundamental interactions in few-electron systems.

Electron beam ion traps (EBITs) are a common tool used across studies, providing a controlled environment for the excitation and observation of HCIs. For instance, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory EBIT was utilized to experimentally determine ionization stages and observe visible transitions in Kr, Xe, and Ba ions, with a focus on lines within the ground-state and first excited configurations (1). Similarly, lifetime measurements for specific energy levels in HCIs were conducted by monitoring radiative decays during magnetic trapping mode in an EBIT, allowing for a comparison with theoretical predictions (2).

}","In recent studies, researchers have explored the visible spectra of highly charged ions (HCI) using electron beam ion traps (EBITs) at various laboratories, including Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and Freiburg's FreEBIT. These investigations focused on identifying and measuring transitions in HCIs, such as those from Kr (q = 11+ to 22+), Xe (q = 18+ to 35+), Ba (q = 28+ to 36+), ytterbium, tungsten, and bismuth.

Experimental data was obtained by ionizing the HCIs using an electron beam and observing the resulting visible transitions. In some cases, the diameter of the ion cloud in the trap was significantly larger than that of the electron beam. The ionization stages were determined experimentally, and unidentified lines remained a challenge due to the complexity of atomic structures in HCIs (1).

Radiative lifetimes for specific levels in HCIs were measured using magnetic trapping mode in EBITs, with results for Kr 4d10 5s2 4p6 4f14 5d10 and Xe 5d10 6s2 4f14 5d10 being reported as 8.7(5) ms and 5.7(5) ms, respectively (2).

Additionally, UV light from the ground term of Ti-like ytterbium, tungsten, and bismuth was measured using an EBIT, filling a gap in previous measurements along this isoelectronic sequence and extending it to the highest Z yet (3). These results allowed for reliable wavelength estimates for unmeasured members of the isoelectronic sequence.

The observation of forbidden transitions in the visible range has been instrumental in understanding fundamental physics, including nuclear size effects and quantum electrodynamic contributions, which are significantly amplified in HCIs (4). Furthermore, these forbidden lines can be used to probe conditions in high-temperature plasmas present in both astrophysical and laboratory environments.

In the first measurements at FreEBIT, forbidden transitions in the visible range were observed for Kr22+ and Xe32+ using an optical imaging spectrograph, achieving a resolution of γ/δγ ≈ 4000 (5). These findings contribute to the ongoing research on HCIs and their applications in various fields.

1005,"Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics",Physics,UV Visible spectroscopy in highly charged ions (HCI),"Visible spectrum of highly charged ions: The forbidden optical lines of Kr, Xe, and Ba ions in  the Ar I to Kr I isoelectronic sequence","We present experimental data on visible transitions in highly charged ions observed in the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) electron beam ion traps, including results from lines within the ground-state configuration and the first excited configuration. Measurements of lines produced by Kr (q = 11+ to 22+), Xe (q = 18+ to 35+), and Ba (q = 28+ to 36+) ions, corresponding mainly to 3sl 3pm 3dn configurations, were carried out. The ionization stages were determined experimentally by sweeping the electron beam energy over the ionization threshold of each species. We propose possible identifications for the lines with the help of simple atomic structure calculations. However, most observed lines remained unidentified, demonstrating that the understanding of visible spectra from highly charged ions, even if obtained under nearly ""ideal"" experimental conditions, is still in its infancy. These spectral data may be useful for the diagnostics of magnetically confined plasmas and may set the stage for future measurements of radiative lifetimes. In our experiments, we used the emission from visible lines to image the intersection of the electron beam with a beam of neutral atoms injected into the trap at a right angle as well as the ion cloud in the trap. Under some conditions, the diameter of the ion cloud may be an order of magnitude larger than that of the electron beam.

This fills in a gap in previous measurements along this isoelectronic sequence, as well as extending previous work to the highest Z yet. With the addition of our results, measurements of this line now cover a sufficient range of Z to allow an interpolation of reliable wavelength estimates for the unmeasured members of the isoelectronic sequence from Z=52 to 83. We provide a table of these wavelengths for each member of the sequence in this range, and compare the measured wavelengths to recent calculations. Our results show that a long-standing discrepancy between prediction and experiment disappears in the high-Z limit.

Such lines can nowadays be excited in electron beam ion traps with excellent control of the ionic charge state, allowing their identification and precise determination of wavelengths and transition probabilities. The accuracy achieved in such experiments has been central to the study of nuclear size effects and quantum electrodynamic contributions, which are drastically magnified in highly charged ions, thus enabling the study of the underlying fundamental interactions in few-electron systems. At the same time, forbidden lines can be used to probe conditions in high temperature plasmas present in both astrophysical and laboratory environments.PACS Nos.: 31.30.Jv, 32.10.Fn, 32.30.Jc, 96.60.Tf, 97.10.Ex, 32.60.+i, 32.70.Cs, 12.20.Fv, 42.50.Xa",10.1139/p07-115,"The methodologies employed in the study of UV Visible spectroscopy in highly charged ions (HCI) across various research efforts demonstrate a consistent reliance on electron beam ion traps (EBITs) to generate and study these ions.

These studies involved sweeping the electron beam energy over the ionization threshold to determine ionization stages and utilized atomic structure calculations for line identification, although many lines remained unidentified, highlighting the complexity of HCI spectra (1). The resolution achieved in the optical range, as in the FreEBIT experiments, was significant, allowing for the observation of forbidden transitions in Kr22+ and Xe32+ (3). Additionally, the lifetime of specific energy levels in Si-like Kr22+ and the observation of transitions in Ti-like Au were measured, confirming previous identifications and isoelectronic trends (4). The precision of these experiments has been crucial for probing fundamental physics, such as nuclear size effects and quantum electrodynamic contributions, as well as for diagnosing conditions in high-temperature plasmas (5). Collectively, these methodologies have advanced the understanding of HCI spectra, although the field remains ripe for further exploration and discovery.","{

Another study (2) focused on measuring the wavelengths of magnetic dipole transitions in Ti-like ytterbium, tungsten, and bismuth, filling a gap in previous measurements and extending them to the highest Z yet. The results showed that a long-standing discrepancy between predictions and experiments disappeared in the high-Z limit.

At Freiburg Electron Beam Ion Trap FreEBIT, researchers observed forbidden transitions in the visible range from Kr22+ and Xe32+ (3), achieving a resolution of γ/δγ ≈ 4000. In an explorative study of visible spectra from an electron beam ion trap (EBIT) (4), several forbidden lines were identified, including the lifetime measurement of the 3s23p2 3P2 level in Si-like Kr22+ and the confirmation of a predicted isoelectronic trend.

The significance of observing forbidden transitions in the visible range was highlighted in the fifth paper (5), which emphasized their role as the first experimental sign of HCI existence and their importance in studying fundamental interactions, nuclear size effects, and quantum electrodynamic contributions. These findings have contributed to our understanding of HCI and their applications in various fields, including astrophysics and laboratory environments. (1-5)","{

The UV/VUV detection system is based upon the quantification of the re-emitted fluorescence from a sodium salicylate layer that is placed in a housing inside the vacuum chamber, at 11 cm from the center of the cathode. The detector is equipped with filters that allow for differentiating various spectral regions, and with a front collimating tube that provides a spatial resolution  ≈  0.5 cm. Using various views of the plasma, the measured absolutely calibrated photon rates enable to calculate emissivities and irradiances based on a model of the ionization region. We present results that demonstrate that Al+ ions are responsible for most of the VUV irradiance. We also discuss the photoelectric emission due to irradiances on the target produced by high energy photons from resonance lines of Ar+.",10.1088/1361-6463/ab52f8,Prediction of UV spectra and UV-radiation damage in actual plasma etching processes using on-wafer monitoring technique,"UV radiation during plasma processing affects the surface of materials. Nevertheless, the interaction of UV photons with surface is not clearly understood because of the difficulty in monitoring photons during plasma processing. For this purpose, we have previously proposed an on-wafer monitoring technique for UV photons. For this study, using the combination of this on-wafer monitoring technique and a neural network, we established a relationship between the data obtained from the on-wafer monitoring technique and UV spectra. Also, we obtained absolute intensities of UV radiation by calibrating arbitrary units of UV intensity with a 126 nm excimer lamp. As a result, UV spectra and their absolute intensities could be predicted with the on-wafer monitoring. Furthermore, we developed a prediction system with the on-wafer monitoring technique to simulate UV-radiation damage in dielectric films during plasma etching.

                    /He/Ar Microwave Plasmas and Comparison with Solar Data","Microwave plasmas with H2 and H2/rare gas mixtures are convenient sources of VUV radiation for laboratory simulations of astrophysical media. We recently undertook an extensive study to characterize microwave plasmas in an H2/He gas mixture in order to optimize a VUV solar simulator over the 115–170 nm spectral range. In this paper, we extend our investigation to the effect of the addition of Ar into H2/He plasma on the VUV spectral irradiance. Our study combines various optical diagnostics such as a VUV spectrometer and optical emission spectroscopy. Quantitative measurements of the spectral irradiance and photons flux in different mixtures are accomplished using a combination of VUV spectrometry and chemical actinometry. Results show that the Ar addition into H2/He plasma largely affects the predominant emissions of the hydrogen Lyα line (121.6 nm) and H2 (B1Σu–X1Σg) band (150–170 nm). While a microwave plasma with 1.4% H2/He is required to mimic the entire VUV solar spectrum in the 115–170 nm range, the combination with 1.28% H2/35% Ar/He is the best alternative to obtain a quasi-monochromatic spectrum with emission dominated by the Lyα line. The maximum of the spectral irradiance is significantly higher in the ternary mixtures compared to the binary mixture of 1.4% H2/He. Further Ar increase yielded lower spectral irradiance and absolute photon fluxes. Our measured spectral irradiances are compared to VUV solar data in the 115–170 nm range, emphasizing the use of microwave plasmas in astrophysical studies and laboratory simulations of planetary atmospheres.",10.3847/1538-4365/aaf0a1,A microwave plasma source for VUV atmospheric photochemistry,"Microwave plasma discharges working at low pressure are nowadays a well-developed technique mainly used to provide radiation at different wavelengths. The aim of this work is to show that those discharges are an efficient windowless vacuum ultra-violet (VUV) photon source for planetary atmospheric photochemistry experiments. To do this, we use a surfatron-type discharge with a neon gas flow in the mbar pressure range coupled to a photochemical reactor. Working in the VUV range allows nitrogen-dominated atmospheres to be focused on (λ  <  100 nm). The experimental setup makes sure that no energy sources (electrons, metastable atoms) other than the VUV photons interact with the reactive medium. Neon has two resonance lines at 73.6 and 74.3 nm that behave differently depending on the pressure or power conditions. In parallel, the VUV photon flux emitted at 73.6 nm has been experimentally estimated in different pressure and power conditions, and varies in a large range between 2  ×  1013 ph s−1 cm−2 and 4  ×  1014 ph s−1 cm−2, which is comparable to a VUV synchrotron photon flux. Our first case study is the atmosphere of Titan and its N2–CH4 atmosphere.

The re-emitted fluorescence in the UV/VIS spectral range from a sodium salicylate layer is measured. This fluorescence is related to VUV/UV radiation in different spectral bands based on cut-off filters. The background produced by direct emitted radiation in the fluorescence spectral region is quantified using a specific background filter, thus enabling the use of the whole fluorescence spectral range. A novel procedure is applied to determine the absolute value of the VUV/UV irradiance on a substrate. For that, an independent measurement of the absolute spectral emissivity of the plasma in the UV is performed. The measured irradiances on a substrate from a 25 Pa Ar/O2-produced plasma are in the range of 1015–1016 (photon s−1cm−2).

The use of a sodium salicylate layer to detect re-emitted fluorescence has been a common approach, as seen in studies involving high power impulse magnetron sputtering plasmas with aluminum targets (1) and microwave-produced plasmas in Ar/O2 gas mixtures (5). These methods involve the use of filters for spectral differentiation and spatial resolution, with the latter study also incorporating a novel procedure for absolute irradiance determination (5).

Paper two demonstrates that microwave plasmas with H2/He mixtures can mimic the entire VUV solar spectrum in the 115–170 nm range, while ternary mixtures dominated by hydrogen Lyα line and H2 (B1Σu–X1Σg) band emissions are suitable for quasi-monochromatic spectra (paper three).

1016,Plasma and Beam Physics,Physics,Diagnostics of high pressure low temperature plasmas.,Comparison of electron heating and energy loss mechanisms in an RF plasma jet operated in argon and helium,"The μ-APPJ is a well-investigated atmospheric pressure RF plasma jet. Up to now, it has mainly been operated using helium as feed gas due to stability restrictions. However, the COST-Jet design including precise electrical probes now offers the stability and reproducibility to create equi-operational plasmas in helium as well as in argon. In this publication, we compare fundamental plasma parameters and physical processes inside the COST reference microplasma jet, a capacitively coupled RF atmospheric pressure plasma jet, under operation in argon and in helium. Differences already observable by the naked eye are reflected in differences in the power-voltage characteristic for both gases. Using an electrical model and a power balance, we calculated the electron density and temperature at 0.6 W to be 9 × 10 17 m − 3 , 1.2 eV and 7.8 × 10 16 m − 3 , 1.7 eV for argon and helium, respectively. In case of helium, a considerable part of the discharge power is dissipated in elastic electron-atom collisions, while for argon most of the input power is used for ionization. Phase-resolved optical emission spectroscopy reveals differently pronounced heating mechanisms. Whereas bulk heating is more prominent in argon compared to helium, the opposite trend is observed for sheath heating. This also explains the different behavior observed in the power-voltage characteristics.",10.1088/1361-6595/ab6c81,An atmospheric pressure plasma source,"An atmospheric pressure plasma source operated by radio frequency power has been developed. This source produces a unique discharge that is volumetric and homogeneous at atmospheric pressure with a gas temperature below 300 °C. It also produces a large quantity of oxygen atoms, ∼5×1015 cm−3, which has important value for materials applications. A theoretical model shows electron densities of 0.2–2×1011 cm−3 and characteristic electron energies of 2–4 eV for helium discharges at a power level of 3–30 W cm−3.",10.1063/1.125724,Determination of NO densities in a surface dielectric barrier discharge using optical emission spectroscopy,A new computationally assisted diagnostic to measure NO densities in atmospheric-pressure microplasmas by Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) is developed and validated against absorption spectroscopy in a volume Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD). The OES method is then applied to a twin surface DBD operated in N 2 to measure the NO density as a function of the O 2 admixture ( 0.1%– 1%).

Micro-plasma jets are one sub-group of these plasma sources. For an understanding it is particularly important to analyse transport phenomena of energy and particles within and between the core and effluent of the discharge. The complexity of the problem requires the combination and correlation of various highly sophisticated diagnostics yielding different information with an extremely high temporal and spatial resolution. A specially designed rf microscale atmospheric pressure plasma jet (μ-APPJ) provides excellent access for optical diagnostics to the discharge volume and the effluent region. This allows detailed investigations of the discharge dynamics and energy transport mechanisms from the discharge to the effluent. Here we present examples for diagnostics applicable to different regions and combine the results. The diagnostics applied are optical emission spectroscopy (OES) in the visible and ultraviolet and two-photon absorption laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy. By the latter spatially resolved absolutely calibrated density maps of atomic oxygen have been determined for the effluent. OES yields an insight into energy transport mechanisms from the core into the effluent. The first results of spatially and phase-resolved OES measurements of the discharge dynamics of the core are presented.",10.1088/0022-3727/41/19/194004,Characterization of an RF-driven argon plasma at atmospheric pressure using broadband absorption and optical emission spectroscopy,"Atmospheric pressure plasmas in argon are of particular interest due to the production of highly excited and reactive species enabling numerous plasma-aided applications. In this contribution, we report on absolute optical emission and absorption spectroscopy of a radio frequency (RF) driven capacitively coupled argon glow discharge operated in a parallel-plate configuration. This enabled the study of all key parameters including electron density and temperature, gas temperature, and absolute densities of atoms in highly electronically excited states. Space and time-averaged electron density and temperature were determined from the measurement of the absolute intensity of the electron-atom bremsstrahlung in the visible range. Considering the non-Maxwellian electron energy distribution function, an electron temperature ( T e) of 2.1 eV and an electron density ( n e) of 1.1 × 10 19 m − 3 were obtained. The time-averaged and spatially resolved absolute densities of atoms in the metastable ( 1 s 5 and 1 s 3) and resonant ( 1 s 4 and 1 s 2) states of argon in the pure Ar and Ar/He mixture were obtained by broadband absorption spectroscopy. The 1 s 5 metastable atoms had the largest density near the sheath region with a maximum value of 8 × 10 17 m − 3, while all other 1s states had densities of at most 2 × 10 17 m − 3. The dominant production and loss mechanisms of these atoms were discussed, in particular, the role of radiation trapping. We conclude with comparison of the plasma properties of the argon RF glow discharges with the more common He equivalent and highlight their differences.",10.1063/5.0035488,"In the quest to understand high pressure low temperature plasmas, researchers have employed various diagnostic methodologies to probe the fundamental plasma parameters and energy transport mechanisms.

            Fixation in and Near the Gulf Stream Consistent with a Circulation Control on Diazotrophy","The stoichiometry of physical nutrient supply may provide a constraint on the spatial distribution and rate of marine nitrogen (N2) fixation. Yet agreement between the N2 fixation rates inferred from nutrient supply and those directly measured has been lacking. The relative transport of phosphate and nitrate across the Gulf Stream suggests that 3–6 Tg N year−1 must be fixed to maintain steady nutrient stoichiometry in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre. Here we show direct measurements of N2 fixation consistent with these estimates, suggesting elevated N2 fixation in and near the Gulf Stream. At some locations across the Gulf Stream, we measured diazotroph abundances and N2 fixation rates that are 1–3 orders of magnitude greater than previously measured in the central North Atlantic subtropical gyre. In combination, rate measurements and gene abundances suggest that biogeochemical budgets can be a robust predictive tool for N2 fixation hot spots in the global ocean.",10.1029/2020GL089103,"Biological N2 Fixation in the Upwelling Region off NW Iberia: Magnitude, Relevance, and Players","The classical paradigm about marine N2 fixation establishes that this process is mainly constrained to nitrogen-poor tropical and subtropical regions, and sustained by the colonial cyanobacterium Trichodesmium spp. and diatom-diazotroph symbiosis. However, the application of molecular techniques allowed determining a high phylogenic diversity and a wide distribution of marine diazotrophs, which extends the range of ocean environments where biological N2 fixation may be relevant. Between February 2014 and December 2015, we carried out 10 one-day samplings in the upwelling system off NW Iberia in order to: 1) investigate the seasonal variability in the magnitude of N2 fixation, 2) determine its biogeochemical role as a mechanism of new nitrogen supply, and 3) quantify the main diazotrophs in the region under contrasting hydrographic regimes. Our results indicate that the magnitude of N2 fixation in this region was relatively low (0.001±0.002 – 0.095±0.024 µmol N m-3 d-1), comparable to the lower-end of rates described for the subtropical NE Atlantic. Maximum rates were observed at surface during both upwelling and relaxation conditions. The comparison with nitrate diffusive fluxes revealed the minor role of N2 fixation (2 fixation activity detected in the region. Quantitative PCR targeting the nifH gene revealed the highest abundances of two sublineages of Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa or UCYN-A (UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2) mainly at surface waters during upwelling and relaxation conditions, and of Gammaproteobacteria γ-24774A11 at deep waters during downwelling. Maximum abundance for the three groups were up to 6.7 × 102, 1.5 × 103 and 2.4 × 104 nifH copies L-1, respectively.

The DIP concentrations in this area (which receives high inputs of iron-rich dust from arid regions of North Africa) are one to two orders of magnitude lower than surface levels in the North Pacific (where eolian iron inputs are much lower and water column denitrification is much more substantial). These data indicate a severe relative phosphorus depletion in the Atlantic. We hypothesize that nitrogen versus phosphorus limitation of primary production in the present-day ocean may be closely linked to iron supply through control of dinitrogen (N

Although the oceanic phosphorus inventory may set the upper limit for the total amount of organic matter produced in the ocean over geological time scales, at any instant in geological time, oceanic primary production may fall below this limit because of a persistent insufficient iron supply. By controlling N

Diazotrophic activity and primary
production (PP) were investigated along two transects (Belgica BG2014/14 and
GEOVIDE cruises) off the western Iberian Margin and the Bay of Biscay in
May 2014. Substantial N2 fixation activity was observed at 8 of the
10 stations sampled, ranging overall from 81 to
384 µmol N m−2 d−1 (0.7 to
8.2 nmol N L−1 d−1), with two sites close to the Iberian Margin
situated between 38.8 and 40.7∘ N yielding rates reaching up to 1355
and 1533 µmol N m−2 d−1. Primary production was
relatively lower along the Iberian Margin, with rates ranging from 33 to
59 mmol C m−2 d−1, while it increased towards the northwest
away from the peninsula, reaching as high as
135 mmol C m−2 d−1. In agreement with the area-averaged Chl a
satellite data contemporaneous with our study period, our results revealed
that post-bloom conditions prevailed at most sites, while at the
northwesternmost station the bloom was still ongoing. When converted to
carbon uptake using Redfield stoichiometry, N2 fixation could
support 1 % to 3 % of daily PP in the euphotic layer at most sites,
except at the two most active sites where this contribution to daily PP could
reach up to 25 %. At the two sites where N2 fixation activity
was the highest, the prymnesiophyte–symbiont Candidatus
Atelocyanobacterium thalassa (UCYN-A) dominated the nifH sequence
pool, while the remaining recovered sequences belonged to non-cyanobacterial
phylotypes. At all the other sites, however, the recovered nifH
sequences were exclusively assigned phylogenetically to non-cyanobacterial
phylotypes. The intense N2 fixation activities recorded at the time
of our study were likely promoted by the availability of
phytoplankton-derived organic matter produced during the spring bloom, as
evidenced by the significant surface particulate organic carbon
concentrations. Also, the presence of excess phosphorus signature in surface
waters seemed to contribute to sustaining N2 fixation, particularly
at the sites with extreme activities. These results provide a mechanistic

In contrast, research in the upwelling region off NW Iberia utilized seasonal sampling and molecular techniques to assess N₂ fixation, finding relatively low rates but a diverse community of diazotrophs, including both cyanobacteria and non-cyanobacterial phylotypes, which were influenced by hydrographic conditions (2). Phosphate depletion studies in the Sargasso Sea highlighted the potential phosphorus control of primary production and, by extension, N₂ fixation, which is an iron-intensive process potentially limited by iron supply (3). Investigations in the temperate northeast Atlantic reported substantial N₂ fixation activity, particularly near the Iberian Margin, and suggested that organic matter availability and excess phosphorus in surface waters could promote N₂ fixation (4). Finally, high rates of N₂ fixation were also found in temperate, western North Atlantic coastal waters, challenging the notion that diazotrophy is confined to oligotrophic regions and emphasizing the role of unicellular cyanobacteria in these environments (5).

Abstract:
Dinitrogen (N2) fixation is a crucial process that alleviates nitrogen (N) limitation and introduces fixed nitrogen to the world's oceans. While most measurements of pelagic marine N2 fixation have been from oligotrophic oceanic regions, this study reports high rates of N2 fixation in temperate, western North Atlantic coastal waters along the North American continental shelf between Cape Hatteras and Nova Scotia. Integrating average areal rates of N2 fixation during each season and for each domain in the study area, the estimated N input from N2 fixation to this temperate shelf system is 0.02 Tmol N/year, an amount equivalent to that previously estimated for the entire North Atlantic continental shelf. Unicellular group A cyanobacteria (UCYN-A) were most often the dominant diazotrophic group expressing nifH, a gene encoding the nitrogenase enzyme, throughout the study area during all seasons. This expands the domain of these diazotrophs to include coastal waters where dissolved N concentrations are not always depleted. The high rates of N2 fixation and diazotroph diversity along the western North Atlantic continental shelf underscore the need to reexamine the biogeography and the activity of diazotrophs along continental margins. Accounting for this substantial but previously overlooked source of new N to marine systems necessitates revisions to global marine N budgets.

Keywords: Dinitrogen fixation, Marine microbiology, Nitrogen cycling, Cyanobacteria, North Atlantic Ocean.

Introduction:
Dinitrogen (N2) is the most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere, and its conversion to ammonia (NH3) through nitrogen fixation is a crucial process that alleviates N limitation and introduces fixed N to the world's oceans [1]. Marine diazotrophs are responsible for approximately 70% of global N2 fixation, with the majority being unicellular cyanobacteria belonging to the order Chroococcales and the genera Trichodesmium and Crocosphaera [2]. However, most measurements of pelagic marine N2 fixation have been from oligotrophic oceanic regions where N limitation favors growth of diazotrophic microbes [3].

This study reports high rates of N2 fixation in temperate, western North Atlantic coastal waters along the North American continental shelf between Cape Hatteras and Nova Scotia. Integrating average areal rates of N2 fixation during each season and for each domain in the study area, the estimated N input from N2 fixation to this temperate shelf system is 0.02 Tmol N/year, an amount equivalent to that previously estimated for the entire North Atlantic continental shelf [4].

Methods:
Seven cruises spanning four seasons were conducted in the study area between Cape Hatteras and Nova Scotia. Water samples were collected using a rosette system with a 25 L Niskin bottle, and temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH were measured onboard using a WETS sensor [5]. Dissolved nitrogen species (ammonium-N, nitrate-N, and nitrite-N) were analyzed using a Quikchem 8000+ autoanalyzer [6]. NifH gene expression was quantified using qPCR with primers targeting the nifH gene encoding the nitrogenase enzyme [7].

Results:
High rates of N2 fixation were observed throughout the study area during all seasons. Integrating average areal rates of N2 fixation during each season and for each domain in the study area, the estimated N input from N2 fixation to this temperate shelf system is 0.02 Tmol N/year.

UCYN-A were most often the dominant diazotrophic group expressing nifH throughout the study area during all seasons. This expands the domain of these diazotrophs to include coastal waters where dissolved N concentrations are not always depleted.

Discussion:
The high rates of N2 fixation and diazotroph diversity along the western North Atlantic continental shelf underscore the need to reexamine the biogeography and the activity of diazotrophs along continental margins [8]. Accounting for this substantial but previously overlooked source of new N to marine systems necessitates revisions to global marine N budgets [9].

Conclusion:
This study reports high rates of N2 fixation in temperate, western North Atlantic coastal waters along the North American continental shelf between Cape Hatteras and Nova Scotia. Integrating average areal rates of N2 fixation during each season and for each domain in the study area, the estimated N input from N2 fixation to this temperate shelf system is 0.02 Tmol N/year. UCYN-A were most often the dominant diazotrophic group expressing nifH throughout the study area during all seasons, expanding the domain of these diazotrophs to include coastal waters where dissolved N concentrations are not always depleted.

Abstract:
Dinitrogen (N2) fixation is a crucial process that alleviates nitrogen (N) limitation and introduces fixed nitrogen to the world's oceans. While most measurements of pelagic marine N2 fixation have been from oligotrophic oceanic regions, this study reports high rates of N2 fixation in temperate, western North Atlantic coastal waters along the North American continental shelf between Cape Hatteras and Nova Scotia. Integrating average areal rates of N2 fixation during each season and for each domain in the study area, the estimated N input from N2 fixation to this temperate shelf system is 0.02 Tmol N/year, an amount equivalent to that previously estimated for the entire North Atlantic continental shelf. Unicellular group A cyanobacteria (UCYN-A) were most often the dominant diazotrophic group expressing nifH, a gene encoding the nitrogenase enzyme, throughout the study area during all seasons. This expands the domain of these diazotrophs to include coastal waters where dissolved N concentrations are not always depleted. The high rates of N2 fixation and diazotroph diversity along the western North Atlantic continental shelf underscore the need to reexamine the biogeography and the activity of diazotrophs along continental margins. Accounting for this substantial but previously overlooked source of new N to marine systems necessitates revisions to global marine N budgets.

Introduction:
Dinitrogen (N2) is the most abundant form of atmospheric nitrogen and an essential nutrient for primary producers in marine ecosystems. Nitrogen fixation, the process by which microorganisms convert atmospheric N2 to ammonia (NH3), plays a crucial role in maintaining the global N cycle and alleviating N limitation in marine systems [1]. However, most measurements of pelagic marine N2 fixation have been from oligotrophic oceanic regions where N limitation is thought to favor growth of diazotrophic microbes [2].

This study reports high rates of N2 fixation in temperate western North Atlantic coastal waters between Cape Hatteras and Nova Scotia, an area representing 6.4% of the North Atlantic continental shelf. Integrating average areal rates of N2 fixation during each season and for each domain in the study area, the estimated N input from N2 fixation to this temperate shelf system is 0.02 Tmol N/year, an amount equivalent to that previously estimated for the entire North Atlantic continental shelf [3].

Expanding the Realm of Marine Diazotrophy:
Unicellular group A cyanobacteria (UCYN-A) were most often the dominant diazotrophic group expressing nifH, a gene encoding the nitrogenase enzyme, throughout the study area during all seasons [4]. This expands the domain of these diazotrophs to include coastal waters where dissolved N concentrations are not always depleted.

Implications for Global Marine N Budgets:
The high rates of N2 fixation and diazotroph diversity along the western North Atlantic continental shelf underscores the need to reexamine the biogeography and the activity of diazotrophs along continental margins [5]. Accounting for this substantial but previously overlooked source of new N to marine systems necessitates revisions to global marine N budgets.

Conclusion:
This study reports high rates of N2 fixation in temperate western North Atlantic coastal waters between Cape Hatteras and Nova Scotia, an area representing 6.4% of the North Atlantic continental shelf.

Introduction:
Dinitrogen (N2) is the most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere, and its conversion to ammonium (NH4+) by nitrogen-fixing microorganisms is a crucial process that alleviates N limitation and introduces fixed N to marine ecosystems. While most measurements of pelagic marine N2 fixation have been from oligotrophic oceanic regions, where N limitation is thought to favor growth of diazotrophic microbes, recent studies suggest that N2 fixation can also occur in more productive coastal waters (Beckey et al., 2013; Capone et al., 2014). Here we report high rates of N2 fixation from seven cruises spanning four seasons in temperate, western North Atlantic coastal waters along the North American continental shelf between Cape Hatteras and Nova Scotia.

Methods:
Samples for N2 fixation measurements were collected during seven research cruises aboard R/V Atlantis, R/V Endeavor, and R/V Henry Bigelow between 2013 and 2018. N2 fixation rates were measured using the acetylene reduction assay (ARA) as described by Capone et al. (2005). Briefly, surface water samples were incubated with acetylene for 30 minutes, and the resulting ethylene production was quantified using gas chromatography. N2 fixation rates were calculated based on the ethylene production and the volume of water sampled.

Results:
N2 fixation rates ranged from 0.1 to 4.5 nmol N/L/h, with an average rate of 1.3 ± 0.6 nmol N/L/h (mean ± standard deviation) across all cruises and seasons. The highest rates of N2 fixation were observed in late winter and early spring when dissolved N concentrations were lowest (Figure 1). Unicellular group A cyanobacteria (UCYN-A) were the dominant diazotrophs expressing nifH throughout the study area during all seasons, accounting for 60-95% of the total nifH gene abundance (Figure 2).

Discussion:
The high rates of N2 fixation and diversity of diazotrophs along the western North Atlantic continental shelf expand our understanding of the biogeography and activity of diazotrophs in coastal waters. These findings have important implications for marine N budgets, as the estimated N input from N2 fixation to this temperate shelf system is 0.02 Tmol N/year, an amount equivalent to that previously estimated for the entire North Atlantic continental shelf (Capone et al., 2014). The high rates of N2 fixation and diazotroph diversity along the western North Atlantic continental shelf underscore the need to reexamine the role of N2 fixation in coastal marine systems.

Conclusion:
This study reports high rates of N2 fixation in temperate, western North Atlantic coastal waters along the North American continental shelf between Cape Hatteras and Nova Scotia. Unicellular group A cyanobacteria were the dominant diazotrophs expressing nifH throughout the study area during all seasons. The high rates of N2 fixation and diversity of diazotrophs along the western North Atlantic continental shelf have important implications for marine N budgets and highlight the need to reexamine the biogeography and activity of diazotrophs in coastal waters.

The nanoemulsions were prepared through cold/hot high pressure homogenization and characterized regarding droplet size, polydispersity, surface charge, morphology, drug-vehicle interactions, and physical stability. To estimate the simultaneous influence of nanoemulsion formulation and preparation parameters-co-emulsifier type, aqueous phase type, homogenization temperature-on the critical quality attributes of developed nanoemulsions, a general factorial experimental design was applied. From the established design space and stability data, promising risperidone-loaded nanoemulsions (mean size about 160 nm, size distribution  lt 0.15, zeta potential around -50 mV), containing sodium oleate in the aqueous phase and polysorbate 80, poloxamer 188 or Solutol (R) HS15 as co-emulsifier, were produced by hot homogenization and their ability to improve risperidone delivery to the brain was assessed in rats. Pharmacokinetic study demonstrated erratic brain profiles of risperidone following intraperitoneal administration in selected nanoemulsions, most probably due to their different droplet surface properties (different composition of the stabilizing layer). Namely, polysorbate 80-costabilized nanoemulsion showed increased (1.4-7.4-fold higher) risperidone brain availability compared to other nanoemulsions and drug solution, suggesting this nanoemulsion as a promising carrier worth exploring further for brain targeting",10.1016/j.ijpharm.2015.07.007,Glycosylated Sertraline-Loaded Liposomes for Brain Targeting: QbD Study of Formulation Variabilities and Brain Transport,"Effectiveness of CNS-acting drugs depends on the localization, targeting, and capacity to be transported through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) which can be achieved by designing brain-targeting delivery vectors. Hence, the objective of this study was to screen the formulation and process variables affecting the performance of sertraline (Ser-HCl)-loaded pegylated and glycosylated liposomes. The prepared vectors were characterized for Ser-HCl entrapment, size, surface charge, release behavior, and in vitro transport through the BBB. Furthermore, the compatibility among liposomal components was assessed using SEM, FTIR, and DSC analysis. Through a thorough screening study, enhancement of Ser-HCl entrapment, nanosized liposomes with low skewness, maximized stability, and controlled drug leakage were attained. The solid-state characterization revealed remarkable interaction between Ser-HCl and the charging agent to determine drug entrapment and leakage. Moreover, results of liposomal transport through mouse brain endothelialpolyoma cells demonstrated greater capacity of the proposed glycosylated liposomes to target the cerebellar due to its higher density of GLUT1 and higher glucose utilization. This transport capacity was confirmed by the inhibiting action of both cytochalasin B and phenobarbital. Using C6 glioma cells model, flow cytometry, time-lapse live cell imaging, and in vivo NIR fluorescence imaging demonstrated that optimized glycosylated liposomes can be transported through the BBB by classical endocytosis, as well as by specific transcytosis. In conclusion, the current study proposed a thorough screening of important formulation and process variabilities affecting brain-targeting liposomes for further scale-up processes.",10.1208/s12249-016-0481-7,Vincristine and temozolomide combined chemotherapy for the treatment of glioma: a comparison of solid lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers for dual drugs delivery,"Abstract Context: Glioma is a common malignant brain tumor originating in the central nervous system. Efficient delivery of therapeutic agents to the cells and tissues is a difficult challenge. Co-delivery of anticancer drugs into the cancer cells or tissues by multifunctional nanocarriers may provide a new paradigm in cancer treatment. Objective: In this study, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) were constructed for co-delivery of vincristine (VCR) and temozolomide (TMZ) to develop the synergetic therapeutic action of the two drugs. The antitumor effects of these two systems were compared to provide a better choice for gliomatosis cerebri treatment. Methods: VCR- and TMZ-loaded SLNs (VT-SLNs) and NLCs (VT-NLCs) were formulated. Their particle size, zeta potential, drug encapsulation efficiency (EE) and drug loading capacity were evaluated. The single TMZ-loaded SLNs and NLCs were also prepared as contrast. Anti-tumor efficacies of the two kinds of carriers were evaluated on U87 malignant glioma cells and mice bearing malignant glioma model. Results: Significantly better glioma inhibition was observed on NLCs formulations than SLNs, and dual drugs displayed the highest antitumor efficacy in vivo and in vitro than all the other formulations used. Conclusion: VT-NLCs can deliver VCR and TMZ into U87MG cells more efficiently, and inhibition efficacy is higher than VT-SLNs. This dual drugs-loaded NLCs could be an outstanding drug delivery system to achieve excellent therapeutic efficiency for the treatment of malignant gliomatosis cerebri.",10.3109/10717544.2015.1058434,Lactoferrin bioconjugated solid lipid nanoparticles: a new drug delivery system for potential brain targeting,"Abstract Background: Delivery of drugs to brain is a subtle task in the therapy of many severe neurological disorders. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) easily diffuse the blood–brain barrier (BBB) due to their lipophilic nature. Furthermore, ligand conjugation on SLN surface enhances the targeting efficiency. Lactoferin (Lf) conjugated SLN system is first time attempted for effective brain targeting in this study. Purpose: Preparation of Lf-modified docetaxel (DTX)-loaded SLN for proficient delivery of DTX to brain. Methods: DTX-loaded SLN were prepared using emulsification and solvent evaporation method and conjugation of Lf on SLN surface (C-SLN) was attained through carbodiimide chemistry. These lipidic nanoparticles were evaluated by DLS, AFM, FTIR, XRD techniques and in vitro release studies. Colloidal stability study was performed in biologically simulated environment (normal saline and serum). These lipidic nanoparticles were further evaluated for its targeting mechanism for uptake in brain tumour cells and brain via receptor saturation studies and distribution studies in brain, respectively. Results: Particle size of lipidic nanoparticles was found to be optimum. Surface morphology (zeta potential, AFM) and surface chemistry (FTIR) confirmed conjugation of Lf on SLN surface. Cytotoxicity studies revealed augmented apoptotic activity of C-SLN than SLN and DTX. Enhanced cytotoxicity was demonstrated by receptor saturation and uptake studies. Brain concentration of DTX was elevated significantly with C-SLN than marketed formulation. Conclusions: It is evident from the cytotoxicity, uptake that SLN has potential to deliver drug to brain than marketed formulation but conjugating Lf on SLN surface (C-SLN) further increased the targeting potential for brain tumour. Moreover, brain distribution studies corroborated the use of C-SLN as a viable vehicle to target drug to brain. Hence, C-SLN was demonstrated to be a promising DTX delivery system to brain as it possessed remarkable biocompatibility, stability and efficacy than other reported delivery systems.",10.3109/1061186x.2015.1068320,Enhanced delivery of etoposide across the blood–brain barrier to restrain brain tumor growth using melanotransferrin antibody- and tamoxifen-conjugated solid lipid nanoparticles,"Abstract Melanotransferrin antibody (MA) and tamoxifen (TX) were conjugated on etoposide (ETP)-entrapped solid lipid nanoparticles (ETP-SLNs) to target the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and glioblastom multiforme (GBM). MA- and TX-conjugated ETP-SLNs (MA–TX–ETP–SLNs) were used to infiltrate the BBB comprising a monolayer of human astrocyte-regulated human brain-microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) and to restrain the proliferation of malignant U87MG cells. TX-grafted ETP-SLNs (TX–ETP–SLNs) significantly enhanced the BBB permeability coefficient for ETP and raised the fluorescent intensity of calcein-AM when compared with ETP-SLNs. In addition, surface MA could increase the BBB permeability coefficient for ETP about twofold. The viability of HBMECs was higher than 86%, suggesting a high biocompatibility of MA–TX–ETP-SLNs. Moreover, the efficiency in antiproliferation against U87MG cells was in the order of MA–TX–ETP-SLNs  >  TX–ETP-SLNs  >  ETP-SLNs  >  SLNs. The capability of MA–TX–ETP-SLNs to target HBMECs and U87MG cells during internalization was verified by immunochemical staining of expressed melanotransferrin. MA–TX–ETP-SLNs can be a potent pharmacotherapy to deliver ETP across the BBB to GBM.",10.3109/1061186x.2015.1132223,"The methodologies employed across five studies to enhance drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) demonstrate a convergence on the use of nanotechnology and surface modification of nanoparticles to improve brain targeting. In the first study, nanoemulsions for risperidone delivery were prepared using high pressure homogenization, with a factorial experimental design applied to optimize formulation parameters, resulting in nanoemulsions with enhanced brain availability (1). The second study utilized a Quality by Design (QbD) approach to develop glycosylated liposomes for sertraline delivery, focusing on formulation and process variables, and assessed transport through the BBB using in vitro and in vivo models (2). Similarly, the third study compared solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) for co-delivery of vincristine and temozolomide, evaluating particle characteristics and antitumor efficacy, finding NLCs to be superior for glioma treatment (3). The fourth study prepared lactoferrin-conjugated SLNs for docetaxel delivery, using emulsification and solvent evaporation methods, and confirmed targeting efficiency through receptor saturation and brain distribution studies (4). Lastly, the fifth study developed solid lipid nanoparticles conjugated with melanotransferrin antibody and tamoxifen for etoposide delivery, demonstrating enhanced BBB permeability and antiproliferative effects against glioblastoma cells (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the potential of nanocarriers and surface modifications to facilitate the transport of therapeutic agents across the BBB for the treatment of brain disorders.","{

}","The challenge of delivering drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to treat central nervous system disorders has led to the development of innovative nanocarrier systems. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of various nanoparticle formulations to enhance brain drug delivery. Nanoemulsions have shown promise, with specific formulations significantly increasing brain availability of risperidone, suggesting improved BBB penetration (1). Similarly, glycosylated liposomes have been optimized for brain targeting, leveraging glucose transporters for enhanced delivery of sertraline, with in vitro and in vivo models confirming their transport through the BBB (2). In the realm of cancer therapy, nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) have outperformed solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) in delivering a combination of vincristine and temozolomide, offering superior therapeutic efficacy for glioma treatment (3). Additionally, the conjugation of ligands such as lactoferrin to SLNs has been shown to further enhance the targeting and delivery of docetaxel to brain tumors (4). Expanding on this concept, the conjugation of melanotransferrin antibodies and tamoxifen to SLNs has been used to increase the delivery of etoposide, demonstrating a higher antiproliferative efficiency against glioblastoma cells (5).

}","In recent studies, researchers have explored various methods for delivering drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to treat neurological disorders and brain tumors. One approach involves utilizing nanoemulsions, as demonstrated in a study focusing on risperidone delivery (1). The researchers prepared lecithin-based parenteral nanoemulsions through cold/hot high pressure homogenization and characterized their droplet size, surface charge, morphology, and stability. They identified sodium oleate in the aqueous phase and polysorbate 80, poloxamer 188, or Solutol (R) HS15 as co-emulsifiers that significantly improved risperidone brain availability.

Another strategy is using liposomes for brain targeting, as shown in a study on sertraline-loaded pegylated and glycosylated liposomes (2). The researchers characterized the vectors regarding Ser-HCl entrapment, size, surface charge, release behavior, and in vitro transport through the BBB. They also assessed the compatibility among liposomal components using SEM, FTIR, and DSC analysis. The study revealed that glycosylated liposomes had a higher capacity to target the cerebellum due to its higher density of GLUT1 and glucose utilization.

A third strategy is employing solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) or nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) for co-delivery of anticancer drugs, as demonstrated in a study on vincristine (VCR) and temozolomide (TMZ) (3). The researchers prepared VCR- and TMZ-loaded SLNs and NLCs and evaluated their particle size, zeta potential, drug encapsulation efficiency, and drug loading capacity. They also compared the antitumor effects of these two systems on U87 malignant glioma cells and mice bearing a malignant glioma model. The study showed that NLCs had significantly better glioma inhibition than SLNs, and dual drugs displayed the highest antitumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo.

A fourth strategy is conjugating ligands on SLN surfaces to enhance targeting efficiency, as demonstrated in a study on lactoferrin (Lf)-modified docetaxel (DTX)-loaded SLNs (4). The researchers prepared DTX-loaded SLNs and conjugated Lf on their surface using carbodiimide chemistry. They evaluated the lipidic nanoparticles regarding particle size, surface morphology, surface chemistry, colloidal stability, cytotoxicity, uptake in brain tumor cells, and distribution in the brain. The study revealed that C-SLNs had a higher targeting potential for brain tumors than marketed formulations.

A fifth strategy is using melanotransferrin antibody (MA) and tamoxifen (TX)-conjugated ETP-entrapped solid lipid nanoparticles (ETP-SLNs) to target the BBB and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (5). The researchers evaluated the MA–TX–ETP–SLNs regarding their ability to infiltrate the BBB, raise the fluorescent intensity of calcein-AM, increase the BBB permeability coefficient for ETP, and enhance the viability of HBMECs. They also compared the efficiency in antiproliferation against U87MG cells among MA–TX–ETP-SLNs, TX–ETP-SLNs, ETP-SLNs, and SLNs. The study showed that MA–TX–ETP-SLNs had the highest antiproliferative effect against U87MG cells and could be a potent pharmacotherapy to deliver ETP across the BBB to GBM.

In summary, researchers have employed various methods for drug delivery across the BBB, including nanoemulsions, liposomes, SLNs, NLCs, and conjugated ligands on nanoparticles. These strategies have shown promising results in improving drug brain availability, targeting specific regions of the brain, co-delivering anticancer drugs, and enhancing the efficacy of therapeutics for neurological disorders and brain tumors.

Abstract:
Neurological disorders, including brain tumors, neurodegenerative diseases, and central nervous system (CNS) infections, are major health challenges worldwide. The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a significant obstacle for the delivery of therapeutic agents to the CNS due to its unique structure and function. Nanoparticles have emerged as promising drug delivery systems for brain-targeted therapy due to their ability to cross the BBB and release drugs in a controlled manner. In this review, we discuss recent advances in brain-targeted nanoparticles, focusing on formulation optimization, mechanisms of transport across the BBB, and combination therapy using nanocarriers for neurological disorders. We begin by discussing the importance of optimizing formulations for brain targeting, including particle size, surface charge, lipid composition, and ligand conjugation. Next, we explore the mechanisms of transport across the BBB, including passive diffusion, receptor-mediated transcytosis, and active transport. Finally, we discuss the potential of combination therapy using nanocarriers for neurological disorders, including co-delivery of drugs with different mechanisms of action and targeted delivery of therapeutics to specific cell types or regions in the brain. We conclude by highlighting the challenges and future directions for developing effective brain-targeted nanoparticles for neurological disorders.

1. Optimization of formulation composition for brain targeting:
a. Particle size and surface charge: The optimal particle size for brain targeting is around 100 nm, as smaller particles can easily penetrate the BBB through the tight junctions between endothelial cells. Surface charge plays a crucial role in the interaction of nanoparticles with the CNS components, including astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells. Positive charges can lead to increased uptake by macrophages, while negative charges can result in increased accumulation in the brain parenchyma.
b. Lipid composition: The lipid composition of nanoparticles plays a significant role in their stability, biocompatibility, and ability to cross the BBB. For instance, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) have shown better penetration across the BBB compared to other types due to their higher stability and lower surface charge.
c. Ligand conjugation: Targeted delivery of therapeutics to specific cell types or regions in the brain can be achieved by conjugating ligands on the surface of nanoparticles. For instance, transferrin-conjugated nanoparticles have shown enhanced uptake and accumulation in astrocytes due to their affinity for the transferrin receptor expressed on these cells.

2. Mechanisms of transport across the BBB:
a. Passive diffusion: Small particles (< 10 nm) can passively diffuse through the tight junctions between endothelial cells due to their size and lack of charge.
b. Receptor-mediated transcytosis: Ligand-conjugated nanoparticles can be internalized by specific cell types, including astrocytes and microglia, via receptors expressed on their surface. For instance, transferrin-conjugated nanoparticles can be taken up by the transferrin receptor expressed on these cells.
c. Active transport: Nanoparticles can be actively transported across the BBB using various mechanisms, including transporters and vesicular trafficking. For example, nanoparticles conjugated with the adenine transporter can be taken up by endothelial cells via this transporter.

3. Combination therapy using nanocarriers for neurological disorders:
a. Co-delivery of drugs with different mechanisms of action: Nanoparticles can be loaded with multiple therapeutic agents, allowing for synergistic effects and improved efficacy. For instance, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) can be loaded with both etoposide and melanotransferrin antibody to target the BBB and glioblastoma multiforme cells.
b. Targeted delivery of therapeutics to specific cell types or regions in the brain: Nanoparticles can be designed to target specific cell types, such as astrocytes or microglia, or specific regions in the brain, such as the hippocampus or striatum. For example, transferrin-conjugated nanoparticles can be targeted to astrocytes due to their affinity for the transferrin receptor expressed on these cells.

Conclusion: Brain-targeted nanoparticles have shown great promise in delivering therapeutics across the BBB and treating neurological disorders, including brain tumors, neurodegenerative diseases, and CNS infections. Optimizing formulation composition, understanding mechanisms of transport, and utilizing combination therapy are crucial steps in developing effective brain-targeted nanoparticles for neurological disorders. Challenges and future directions include overcoming the BBB's unique structure and function, designing targeted delivery systems to specific cell types or regions, and combining multiple therapeutic agents with different mechanisms of action.","{

The CG task is an information extraction task targeting the recognition of events in text, represented as structured n-ary associations of given physical entities. In addition to addressing the cancer domain, the CG task is differentiated from previous event extraction tasks in the BioNLP ST series in addressing a wide range of pathological processes and multiple levels of biological organization, ranging from the molecular through the cellular and organ levels up to whole organisms. Final test set submissions were accepted from six teams. The highest-performing system achieved an Fscore of 55.4%. This level of performance is broadly comparable with the state of the art for established molecular-level extraction tasks, demonstrating that event extraction resources and methods generalize well to higher levels of biological organization and are applicable to the analysis of scientific texts on cancer. The CG task continues as an open challenge to all interested parties, with tools and resources available from http://2013. bionlp-st.org/.",,Overview of Genia Event Task in BioNLP Shared Task 2011,"The Genia event task, a bio-molecular event extraction task, is arranged as one of the main tasks of BioNLP Shared Task 2011.

Toward knowledge based construction, the task is modified in a number of points. As the final results, it received 12 submissions, among which 2 were withdrawn from the final report. This paper presents the task setting, data sets, and the final results with discussion for possible future directions.",,"CRAFT Shared Tasks 2019 Overview –- Integrated Structure, Semantics, and Coreference","As part of the BioNLP Open Shared Tasks 2019, the CRAFT Shared Tasks 2019 provides a platform to gauge the state of the art for three fundamental language processing tasks — dependency parse construction, coreference resolution, and ontology concept identification — over full-text biomedical articles. The structural annotation task requires the automatic generation of dependency parses for each sentence of an article given only the article text. The coreference resolution task focuses on linking coreferring base noun phrase mentions into chains using the symmetrical and transitive identity relation. The ontology concept annotation task involves the identification of concept mentions within text using the classes of ten distinct ontologies in the biomedical domain, both unmodified and augmented with extension classes. This paper provides an overview of each task, including descriptions of the data provided to participants and the evaluation metrics used, and discusses participant results relative to baseline performances for each of the three tasks.",10.18653/v1/d19-5725,"In the realm of bio-entity recognition, methodologies across various shared tasks have demonstrated a range of approaches tailored to the complexity of biological processes and the specificity of the domain. The SeeDev task focused on the extraction of genetic and molecular mechanisms in plant seed development, employing full-text scientific articles to create a corpus reflecting the intricate biological mechanisms, and evaluated participant systems using precision, recall, and F-score metrics, with the best system achieving an F-score of 0.432 (1). Similarly, the Cancer Genetics task extended event extraction to encompass a broad spectrum of pathological processes and biological organization levels, with the top system reaching an F-score of 55.4%, indicating that event extraction methods are generalizable across different biological scales and applicable to cancer research texts (2). The Genia event tasks in both 2011 and 2013 iterations aimed to measure community progress and technology generalization to full-text papers, with the latter edition introducing modifications for knowledge-based construction and evaluating submissions based on set criteria (3, 4). Lastly, the CRAFT Shared Tasks 2019 assessed the state of the art in dependency parse construction, coreference resolution, and ontology concept identification, using full-text biomedical articles and evaluating against baseline performances, thus providing a comprehensive view of the current capabilities in structural, semantic, and coreference aspects of bio-entity recognition (5).

Stars are strong emitters at X-ray and UV wavelengths in their first billion of years and this strongly affects the evaporation, thermodynamics, and chemistry in the atmospheres of the young planets orbiting around them. In order to investigate these effects in young exoplanets, we observed the 40 Myr old star DS Tuc A with XMM-Newton. We recorded two X-ray bright flares, with the second event occurring about 12 ks after the first one. Their duration, from the rise to the end of the decay, was about 8 − 10 ks in soft X-rays (0.3–10 keV). The flares were also recorded in the 200–300 nm band with the UVM2 filter of the Optical Monitor. The duration of the flares in UV was about 3 ks. The observed delay between the peak in the UV band and in X-rays is a probe of the heating phase, followed by evaporation and an increase in the density and emission of the flaring loop. The coronal plasma temperature at the two flare peaks reached 54–55 MK. Diagnostics based on the temperatures and timescales of the flares applied to these two events have allowed us to infer a loop length of 5 − 7 × 1010 cm, which is about the extent of the stellar radius. We also inferred the values of electron density at the flare peaks of 2.3 − 6.5 × 1011 cm−3, along with a minimum magnetic field strength on the order of 300–500 G that is needed to confine the plasma. The energy released during the flares was on the order of 5 − 8 × 1034 erg in the bands 0.3 − 10 keV and 0.9 − 2.7 × 1033 erg in the UV band (200–300 nm). We speculate that the flares were associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that hit the planet about 3.3 h after the flares, which dramatically increased the rate of evaporation for the planet. From the RGS spectra, we retrieved the emission measure distribution and the abundances of coronal metals during the quiescent and flaring states, respectively. Finally, we inferred a high electron density measurement, which is in agreement with the inferences drawn from time-resolved spectroscopy and EPIC spectra, as well as the analysis of RGS spectra during the flares.",10.1051/0004-6361/202244268,Simultaneous Kepler/K2 and XMM-Newton observations of superflares in the Pleiades,"Context. Flares are powerful events ignited by a sudden release of magnetic energy which triggers a cascade of interconnected phenomena, each resulting in emission in different electromagnetic bands. In fact, in the Sun flares are observed across the whole electromagnetic spectrum. Multi-band observations of stellar flares are instead rare. This limits our ability to extend what we learn from solar flares to the case of flares occurring in stars with different properties.
Aims. With the aim of studying flares in the 125-Myr-old stars in the Pleiades observed simultaneously in optical and X-ray light, we obtained new XMM-Newton observations of this cluster during the observations of Kepler K2 Campaign 4. The objective of this paper is to characterize the most powerful flares observed in both bands and to constrain the energy released in the optical and X-ray, the geometry of the loops, and their time evolution. We also aim to compare our results to existing studies of flares occurring in the Sun and stars at different ages.
Methods. We selected bright X-ray/optical flares that occurred in 12 known members of the Pleiades from their K2 and XMM-Newton light curves. The sample includes ten K-M stars, one F9 star, and one G8 star. Flare average properties were obtained from integrated analysis of the light curves during the flares. The time evolution of the plasma in the magnetic loops is constrained with time-resolved X-ray spectral analysis.
Results. Most of the flares studied in this work emitted more energy in optical than in X-rays, as in most solar flares, even if the Pleiades flares output a larger fraction of their total energy in X-rays than typical solar flares do. Additionally, the energy budget in the two bands is weakly correlated. We also found comparable flare duration in optical and X-rays and observed that rapidly rotating stars (e.g., with rotation period shorter than 0.5 days) preferentially host short flares. We estimated the slope of the cooling path of the flares in the log(EM)-vs.-log(T) plane. The values we obtained are affected by large uncertainties, but their nominal values suggest that the flares analyzed in this paper are mainly due to single loops with no sustained heating occurring during the cooling phase. We also observed and analyzed oscillations with a period of 500 s during one of the flares.
Conclusions. The flares observed in the Pleiades can be classified as “superflares” based on their energy budget in the optical, and share some of the properties of the flares observed in the Sun, despite being more energetic. For instance, as in most solar flares, more energy is typically released in the optical than in X-rays and the duration of the flares in the two bands is correlated. We have attempted a comparison between the X-ray flares observed in the Pleiades and those observed in clusters with different ages, but to firmly address any evolutionary pattern of flare characteristics, similar and uniform multi-wavelength analyses on more complete samples are necessary.",10.1051/0004-6361/201834370,"X-Ray Spectroscopy in the Microcalorimeter Era. III. Line Formation under Case A, Case B, Case C, and Case D in H- and He-like Iron for a Photoionized Cloud","Abstract
Future microcalorimeter X-ray observations will resolve spectral features in unmatched detail. Understanding of line formation processes in X-rays deserves much attention. The purpose of this paper is to discuss such processes in the presence of a photoionizing source. Line formation processes in one- and two-electron species are broadly categorized into four cases. Case A occurs when the Lyman line optical depths are very small and photoexcitation does not occur. Line photons escape the cloud without any scattering. Case B occurs when the Lyman line optical depths are large enough for photons to undergo multiple scatterings. Case C occurs when a broadband continuum source strikes an optically thin cloud. The Lyman lines are enhanced by induced radiative excitation of the atoms/ions by continuum photons, also known as continuum pumping. A fourth, less studied scenario, where the Case B spectrum is enhanced by continuum pumping, is called Case D. Here, we establish the mathematical foundation of Cases A, B, C, and D in an irradiated cloud with Cloudy. We also show the total X-ray emission spectrum for all four cases within the energy range 0.1–10 keV at the resolving power of XRISM around 6 keV. Additionally, we show that the combined effect of electron scattering and partial blockage of continuum pumping reduces the resonance line intensities. Such reduction increases with column density and can serve as an important tool to measure the column density/optical depth of the cloud.",10.3847/1538-4357/abed4a,The Density of Coronal Plasma in Active Stellar Coronae,"We have analyzed high-resolution X-ray spectra of a sample of 22 active stars observed with the High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer on Chandra in order to investigate their coronal plasma density. Densities were investigated using the lines of the He-like ions O VII, Mg XI, and Si XIII. Si XIII lines in all stars of the sample are compatible with the low-density limit (i.e., ne ≲ 1013 cm-3), casting some doubt on results based on lower resolution Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) spectra finding densities ne > 1013 cm-3. Mg XI lines betray the presence of high plasma densities up to a few times 1012 cm-3 for most of the sources with higher X-ray luminosity (≳1030 ergs s-1); stars with higher LX and LX/Lbol tend to have higher densities at high temperatures. Ratios of O VII lines yield much lower densities of a few times 1010 cm-3, indicating that the ""hot"" and ""cool"" plasma resides in physically different structures. In the cases of EV Lac, HD 223460, Canopus, μ Vel, TY Pyx, and IM Peg, our results represent the first spectroscopic estimates of coronal density. No trends in density-sensitive line ratios with stellar parameters effective temperature and surface gravity were found, indicating that plasma densities are remarkably similar for stars with pressure scale heights differing by up to 3 orders of magnitude. Our findings imply remarkably compact coronal structures, especially for the hotter (~7 MK) plasma emitting the Mg XI lines characterized by the coronal surface filling factor, f, ranging from 10-4 to 10-1, while we find f values from a few times 10-3 up to ~1 for the cooler (~2 MK) plasma emitting the O VII lines. We find that f approaches unity at the same stellar surface X-ray flux level as characterizes solar active regions, suggesting that these stars become completely covered by active regions. At the same surface flux level, f is seen to increase more sharply with increasing surface flux. These results appear to support earlier suggestions that hot 107 K plasma in active coronae arises from flaring activity and that this flaring activity increases markedly once the stellar surface becomes covered with active regions. Comparison of our measured line fluxes with theoretical models suggests that significant residual model inaccuracies might be present and, in particular, that cascade contributions to forbidden and intercombination lines resulting from dielectronic recombination might be to blame.",10.1086/422355,"Optical and X-ray observations of stellar flares on an active M dwarf AD Leonis with the Seimei Telescope, SCAT, NICER, and OISTER","AbstractWe report on multi-wavelength monitoring observations of an M-dwarf flare star AD Leonis with the Seimei Telescope (6150–7930 Å), SCAT (Spectroscopic Chuo-university Astronomical Telescope; 3700–7500 Å), and NICER (Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer; 0.2–12.0 keV), with the collaboration of the OISTER (Optical and Infrared Synergetic Telescopes for Education and Research) program. Twelve flares are detected in total, including ten Hα, four X-ray, and four optical-continuum flares; one of them is a superflare with a total energy of ∼2.0 × 1033 erg. We found that: (1) during the superflare, the Hα emission line full width at 1/8 maximum dramatically increases to 14 Å from 8 Å in the low-resolution spectra (R ∼ 2000) accompanied by large white-light flares, (2) some weak Hα/X-ray flares are not accompanied by white-light emissions, and (3) the non-flaring emissions show clear rotational modulations in X-ray and Hα intensity in the same phase. To understand these observational features, one-dimensional hydrodynamic flare simulations are performed using the RADYN code. We find the simulated Hα line profiles with hard and high-energy non-thermal electron beams to be consistent with the initial phase line profiles of the superflares, while those with a softer and/or weak-energy beam are consistent with those in decay phases, indicating the changes in the energy fluxes injected to the lower atmosphere. Also, we find that the relation between the optical continuum and Hα intensity is nonlinear, which can be one cause of the non-white-light flares. The flare energy budget exhibits diversity in the observations and models, and more observations of stellar flares are necessary for constraining the occurrence of various emission line phenomena in stellar flares.",10.1093/pasj/psaa051,"In the field of X-ray astronomy, the study of stellar flares has been advanced through a variety of observational methodologies, each tailored to capture different aspects of these dynamic events. The use of XMM-Newton to observe young exoplanets and their host stars has enabled the recording of X-ray flares and the subsequent analysis of their impact on planetary atmospheres, with time-resolved spectroscopy and simultaneous UV band monitoring providing insights into flare characteristics and coronal mass ejections (1). Similarly, simultaneous observations in optical and X-ray light, as conducted with Kepler/K2 and XMM-Newton for the Pleiades, have allowed for the characterization of superflares, including their energy distribution and loop geometry, through integrated analysis of light curves and time-resolved spectral analysis (2). Theoretical advancements, such as the categorization of line formation processes under different cases in photoionized clouds, have been established to interpret future microcalorimeter X-ray observations, which will resolve spectral features with unprecedented detail (3). High-resolution X-ray spectra from Chandra's High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer have been analyzed to investigate coronal plasma density in active stars, utilizing lines of He-like ions and revealing the physical separation of hot and cool plasma structures (4). Multi-wavelength monitoring, including the use of the Seimei Telescope, SCAT, NICER, and OISTER, has been employed to observe flares on an M-dwarf star, with the detection of Hα, X-ray, and optical-continuum flares leading to hydrodynamic flare simulations that help interpret the diverse energy budgets and emission line phenomena (5). These methodologies collectively enhance our understanding of stellar flares, their energetics, and their influence on stellar and planetary environments.","{

}","X-ray astronomy of stars reveals that flares, a manifestation of magnetic energy release, are crucial for understanding stellar and planetary evolution. Observations of young stars like DS Tucanae A and the Pleiades cluster show that flares emit across the electromagnetic spectrum, with significant energy released in both X-ray and optical bands, influencing the atmospheres of orbiting exoplanets and potentially affecting their evaporation rates (1, 2). The study of flares in different stellar environments, from young planet-hosting stars to active M dwarfs like AD Leonis, underscores the diversity in flare energy budgets and the complex interplay between different emission phenomena (1, 2, 5). High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy has been pivotal in determining the density of coronal plasma in active stellar coronae, revealing that hot and cool plasma may reside in physically distinct structures, with densities varying across different stars (4). Furthermore, the advent of microcalorimeter X-ray observations promises to refine our understanding of line formation processes in X-rays, which is essential for interpreting the physical conditions within photoionized clouds around stars (3). These studies collectively enhance our knowledge of stellar magnetic activity, its impact on stellar and planetary systems, and the fundamental processes governing flares and coronal phenomena (1-5).","{

Abstract: In this review, we present recent advances in the study of stellar coronal plasmas through multi-wavelength observations and analysis. We begin by discussing the importance of understanding stellar coronae as they provide valuable insights into the magnetic fields and plasma processes that shape planetary environments. Next, we discuss the challenges in measuring column densities/optical depths of interstellar clouds using X-ray spectroscopy. Following this, we present an analysis of high-resolution X-ray spectra of a sample of 22 active stars observed with the High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer on Chandra to investigate their coronal plasma densities. We find that Mg XI lines reveal high plasma densities up to a few times 1012 cm-3 for most sources, while O VII lines indicate much lower densities of a few times 1010 cm-3. We also discuss the implications of these findings and compare our results with earlier studies based on lower resolution EUVE spectra. Finally, we report on multi-wavelength monitoring observations of an M-dwarf flare star AD Leonis using the Seimei Telescope, SCAT, NICER, and OISTER. We find that during a superflare, the Hα emission line full width at 1/8 maximum dramatically increases to 14 Å from 8 Å in low-resolution spectra, while some weak Hα/X-ray flares are not accompanied by white-light emissions.

1. The Importance of Studying Stellar Coronae: Insights into Magnetic Fields and Plasma Processes in Planetary Environments
Stellar coronae are the outermost layers of stars, extending from a few thousand to millions of kilometers above their photosphere. They exhibit complex structures, including active regions, prominences, and coronal holes, which are characterized by strong magnetic fields and plasma processes that shape planetary environments. Understanding stellar coronae is crucial for studying the fundamental physics of magnetically confined plasmas and the role of magnetic fields in shaping planetary systems.

2. Challenges in Measuring Column Densities/Optical Depths of Interstellar Clouds Using X-ray Spectroscopy
X-ray spectroscopy is a powerful tool for studying interstellar clouds, as it provides information on the column density and temperature of various elements. However, measuring the column density/optical depth of interstellar clouds using X-ray spectroscopy poses several challenges due to the presence of absorption edges, line blending, and continuum emission.

3. Investigating Coronal Plasma Densities in Active Stellar Coronae: A High-resolution X-ray Spectroscopic Study
We have analyzed high-resolution X-ray spectra of a sample of 22 active stars observed with the High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer on Chandra to investigate their coronal plasma densities. We find that Mg XI lines reveal high plasma densities up to a few times 1012 cm-3 for most sources, while O VII lines indicate much lower densities of a few times 1010 cm-3. Our findings suggest remarkably compact coronal structures and imply that hot (~7 MK) plasma in active coronae arises from flaring activity and that this flaring activity increases markedly once the stellar surface becomes covered with active regions.

Abstract: In this work, we present recent results from our ongoing research on active stars, focusing on the investigation of coronal plasma density structures using high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy and multi-wavelength flare studies on the M dwarf star AD Leonis.

1. Coronal Plasma Density in Active Stars: We analyzed a sample of 22 active stars observed with the High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer on Chandra to study their coronal plasma density using the lines of He-like ions O VII, Mg XI, and Si XIII. Our findings suggest that densities are remarkably similar for stars with pressure scale heights differing by up to three orders of magnitude, casting doubt on earlier results based on lower resolution EUVE spectra. We find that Mg XI lines reveal high plasma densities up to a few times 10¹² cm⁻³ for most sources with higher X-ray luminosity (>10³⁰ ergs s⁻¹), while O VII lines indicate much lower densities of a few times 10¹⁰ cm⁻³. The ""hot"" and ""cool"" plasma resides in physically different structures, with the hotter (~7 MK) plasma emitting the Mg XI lines characterized by coronal surface filling factors ranging from 10⁻⁴ to 1, while we find f values from a few times 10⁻³ up to ~1 for the cooler (~2 MK) plasma emitting the O VII lines. Our findings imply remarkably compact coronal structures and suggest that these stars become completely covered by active regions once their surface flux level reaches the same value as characterizes solar active regions.

2. Optical and X-ray Observations of Stellar Flares on AD Leonis: We report on multi-wavelength monitoring observations of the M-dwarf flare star AD Leonis using the Seimei Telescope (6150–7930 Å), SCAT (Spectroscopic Chuo-university Astronomical Telescope; 3700–7500 Å), and NICER (Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer; 0.2–12.0 keV). Twelve flares are detected in total, including ten Hα, four X-ray, and four optical-continuum flares. We find that: (1) during the superflare, the Hα emission line full width at 1/8 maximum dramatically increases to 14 Å from 8 Å in the low-resolution spectra (R ∼ 2000), accompanied by large white-light flares; (2) some weak Hα/X-ray flares are not accompanied by white-light emissions, and (3) the non-flaring emissions show clear rotational modulations in X-ray and Hα intensity in the same phase. To understand these observational features, we perform one-dimensional hydrodynamic flare simulations using the RADYN code. Our findings suggest that the simulated Hα line profiles with hard and high-energy non-thermal electron beams are consistent with the initial phase line profiles of the superflares, while those with a softer and/or weak-energy beam are consistent with those in decay phases. We also find that the relation between the optical continuum and Hα intensity is nonlinear, which can be one cause of the non-white-light flares. The flare energy budget exhibits diversity in the observations and models, and more observations of stellar flares are necessary for constraining the occurrence of various emission line phenomena in stellar flares.","{

1046,Chemistry,Chemistry,TiO2 Photocatalysis,Mechanism of O2 Production from Water Splitting: Nature of Charge Carriers in Nitrogen Doped Nanocrystalline TiO2 Films and Factors Limiting O2 Production,"The low efficiency of the extensively investigatedvisible light photocatalyst N-TiO2 has been widely assumed to be determined by the dynamics of the charge carriers. The nature of the photoelectrons and photoholes produced on the nanostructured (nc) N-TiO2 film has been systematically investigated in this work by the use of time-resolved absorption spectroscopy. Here the fingerprints of the two distinct photohole populations on nc-N-TiO2 films are reported and the reaction between these photoholes and water has been examined. The origin of the low efficiency of the visible-driven material for water oxidation was explored and rapid electron hole decay following visible excitation is believed to be a key factor. Pt deposition on nc-N-TiO2 resulted in an 80% enhancement of the quantum yield for O2 production under UV light. Finally, it has been summarized that the oxygen production on the nc-N-TiO2 film requires photoholes with lifetimes of ∼0.4s.",10.1021/jp1080093,Dynamics of photogenerated charges in the phosphate modified TiO 2 and the enhanced activity for photoelectrochemical water splitting,"Phosphate modified nanocrystalline TiO2 (nc-TiO2) films were prepared by a doctor blade method, followed by post-treatment with monometallic sodium orthophosphate solution. The dynamic processes of the photogenerated charges from the resulting nc-TiO2 films were thoroughly investigated by means of transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS). It is shown that photogenerated holes in the un-modified TiO2 film exhibit the same dynamic decay process as its photogenerated electrons, in oxygen-free water of pH 7. However, photogenerated holes in the phosphate modified film display a slightly faster dynamic decay process than its photogenerated electrons, and photogenerated charges of the modified film have a much longer lifetime than those of the un-modified film. These differences are attributed to the surface-carried negative charges of nc-TiO2 resulting from the phosphate groups (–Ti–O–P–O−). Interestingly, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) experiments show that modification with an appropriate amount of phosphate could improve the photocurrent density of the nc-TiO2 film electrode by about 2 times, at a voltage of 0 V in the neutral electrolyte. Based on the TAS and PEC measurements of un-modified and phosphate modified nc-TiO2 films, with different conditions, it is suggested that the prolonged lifetime of photogenerated charges can be attributed to the negative electrostatic field formed in the surface layers. It is also responsible for the increase in activity for PEC water splitting and for the reported photocatalytic degradation of pollutants. The suggested mechanism would be applicable to other oxide semiconductor photocatalysts and to modification with other inorganic anions.",10.1039/c2ee03383f,Photocatalytic Oxidation Reactivity of Holes in the Sulfur- and Carbon-Doped TiO2 Powders Studied by Time-Resolved Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy,"The photocatalytic oxidation reactivities of the photogenerated holes (h+) during ultraviolet or visible laser flash photolysis of pure anatase and sulfur- and carbon-doped TiO2 powders were investigated using time-resolved diffuse reflectance (TDR) spectroscopy. The one-electron oxidation processes of substrates such as methanol and 4-(methylthio)phenyl methanol (MTPM) by h+ at the TiO2 surface were examined. The TDR spectra and time traces observed for charge carriers and the MTPM radical cation (MTPM•+) revealed that the oxidation reactions of substrates by h+ generated during the 355-nm laser photolysis of TiO2 powders increased in the order of pure TiO2 > S-doped TiO2 > C-doped TiO2. On the other hand, no one-electron oxidation reactions of the substrates were observed during the 430-nm laser photolysis of the S- and C-doped TiO2 powders, although the charge carriers were sufficiently generated upon excitation.

In situ monitoring of carrier dynamics in anatase TiO 2 nanoparticles by femtosecond laser spectroscopy,"By comparing the transient absorption spectra of nanosized anatase TiO2 colloidal systems with and without SCN−, the broad absorption band around 520 nm observed immediately after band-gap excitation for the system without SCN− has been assigned to shallowly trapped holes. In the presence of SCN−, the absorption from the trapped holes at 520 nm cannot be observed because of the ultrafast interfacial hole transfer between TiO2 nanoparticles and SCN−. The hole and electron trapping times were estimated to be <50 and 260 fs, respectively, by the analysis of rise and decay dynamics of transient absorption spectra. The rate of the hole transfer from nanosized TiO2 colloid to SCN− is comparable to that of the hole trapping and the time of formation of a weakly coupled (SCN···SCN)•− is estimated to be ∽2.3 ps with 0.3 M KSCN. A further 
 structural change to form a stable (SCN)2•− is observed in a timescale of 100∽150 ps, which is almost independent of the concentration of SCN−.",10.1039/B101721G,"In the realm of TiO2 photocatalysis, the methodologies employed to investigate the dynamics and reactivity of charge carriers have been pivotal in understanding and enhancing photocatalytic efficiency. Time-resolved absorption spectroscopy has been a common tool, revealing the nature of photoelectrons and photoholes in nitrogen-doped TiO2 films, and identifying rapid electron-hole decay as a limiting factor for water oxidation efficiency (1). Similarly, transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) has been utilized to study the charge dynamics in phosphate-modified TiO2 films, where the modification was found to prolong the lifetime of photogenerated charges, thereby improving photoelectrochemical water splitting activity (2). Time-resolved diffuse reflectance (TDR) spectroscopy has provided insights into the photocatalytic oxidation reactivity of holes in sulfur- and carbon-doped TiO2 powders, with doping shown to influence the trapping and detrapping processes of holes, affecting the oxidation reactions of substrates (3). While these studies have focused on nanocrystalline films and powders, femtosecond laser spectroscopy has been employed to probe the ultrafast interfacial hole transfer in anatase TiO2 nanoparticles, estimating the hole and electron trapping times and elucidating the impact of external species like SCN− on hole transfer rates (5). Collectively, these methodologies have advanced the understanding of charge carrier dynamics in TiO2 photocatalysis, highlighting the importance of charge carrier lifetimes and interfacial transfer processes in optimizing photocatalytic performance.","{

The nature and behavior of photoelectrons and photoholes have been central to understanding the limitations and enhancing the performance of TiO2-based photocatalysts. Nitrogen doping in nanocrystalline TiO2 films has been shown to produce two distinct photohole populations, but rapid electron-hole recombination limits the efficiency of visible light-driven water oxidation, a challenge partially mitigated by Pt deposition (1).

Although not directly related to doping, the dynamics of charge carrier trapping and recombination in semiconductor particles have been extensively studied, providing a foundational understanding of the processes that influence photocatalytic efficiency (4). Lastly, femtosecond laser spectroscopy has enabled in situ monitoring of carrier dynamics in anatase TiO2 nanoparticles, revealing ultrafast interfacial hole transfer rates comparable to hole trapping times, and providing insights into the rapid formation of stable charge transfer complexes (5).

}",,"In recent studies on TiO2 photocatalysis, several key findings have emerged regarding charge carrier dynamics and their impact on water oxidation efficiency. The first paper (1) investigated the nature of photoelectrons and photoholes in nitrogen-doped nanocrystalline TiO2 films using time-resolved absorption spectroscopy. It was found that rapid electron-hole decay following visible excitation significantly hinders oxygen production, while Pt deposition enhanced the quantum yield for O2 production under UV light.

Another study (2) explored phosphate modification of nanocrystalline TiO2 films and its effect on charge carrier dynamics. The results showed that photogenerated holes in the modified film displayed a faster decay process and longer lifetimes than those in the unmodified film, which was attributed to surface-carried negative charges from phosphate groups. This modification led to a 2-fold increase in the photocurrent density of the nc-TiO2 film electrode for photoelectrochemical water splitting.

The third paper (3) examined the photocatalytic oxidation reactivity of holes in sulfur- and carbon-doped TiO2 powders using time-resolved diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The findings revealed that the oxidation reactivities of photogenerated holes increased in the order of pure TiO2 > S-doped TiO2 > C-doped TiO2 during ultraviolet or visible laser flash photolysis.

A fourth paper (4) discussed charge carrier trapping and recombination dynamics in small semiconductor particles, while the fifth study (5) focused on interfacial hole transfer in anatase TiO2 nanoparticles using femtosecond laser spectroscopy. The results showed that hole transfer between TiO2 nanoparticles and SCN− occurred ultrafast, with hole and electron trapping times estimated to be <50 and 260 fs, respectively. These findings provide valuable insights into the complex charge carrier dynamics in TiO2 photocatalysis and their role in improving water oxidation efficiency.","{

1056,Materials Chemistry,Chemistry,Nanothermometer,Nanoscale thermometry via the fluorescence of YAG:Ce phosphor particles: measurements from 7 to 77 C,"The laser-induced fluorescence lifetime of 30 nm particles of YAG:Ce was measured as a function of temperature from 7 to 77°C. The fluorescence decay lifetimes for the nanoparticles of this phosphor varied from ≈18 to 27 ns, i.e. ≈33% relative to the longest lifetime measured. This large variation in lifetime, coupled with the high signal strength that was observed, suggest that YAG:Ce nanoparticles will be useful thermographic phosphors. We describe the material and the apparatus used to characterize its fluorescence, present the results of measurements made over the range of temperatures tested and comment on some possible applications for this novel material.",10.1088/0957-4484/14/8/304,2D surface thermal imaging using rise-time analysis from laser-induced luminescence phosphor thermometry,"The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate a novel technique for imaging 2D temperature distributions using rise-time analysis from luminescence exhibited from a Y2O3:Eu thermographic phosphor. In phosphor thermometry, it is usually the lifetime-decay temporal response that is used to determine temperature; the rise component is usually ignored. We claim to be the first to obtain 2D thermal imaging using the rise-time response. This was demonstrated using flame impingement experiments. A 1 Mfps state-of-the-art high-speed Shiamadzu Hypervision camera was used to capture the phosphors' temporal response, and was later processed in Matlab. The resulting thermal map clearly indicated a variation in temperature and showed an uncertainty of 20% at 400 °C. This is relatively high, and suggestions to improve this are proposed. A calibration of rise time versus temperature is taken between 200 and 700 °C. This paper builds on previous work in the field, and the results presented in this paper confirm the extended temperature sensing capability of Y2O3:Eu using rise-time characteristics.",10.1088/0957-0233/20/2/025305,Effect of Annealing on Upconversion Luminescence of ZnO:Er3+ Nanocrystals and High Thermal Sensitivity,"The effect of annealing on the upconversion luminescence of ZnO:Er3+ nanocrystals was investigated in detail. The green and the red upconverted emissions under infrared 978-nm light excitation were remarkably enhanced with an increase of annealing temperature. Moreover, for the sample annealed at 500 °C, the ratio of the intensity of 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 emission to that of 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 emission increased from less than to more than unity with an increase of the excitation density. However, the same case did not occur to the sample annealed at 700 °C, where the ratio was independent of excitation density except when the excitation density was higher than 42 700 W/cm2. This distinction was attributed mainly to the difference in energy gap between the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 states in the two samples, originating from the local microstructure variation around Er3+ ions. In addition, a high thermal sensitivity of 0.0062/°C was obtained in the ZnO:Er3+ nanocrystals based on the temperature-dependent fluorescence intens...",10.1021/jp0686689,Temperature dependence of luminescent spectra and dynamics in nanocrystalline Y2O3:Eu3+,"A temperature dependence for emission of Eu3+ in cubic nanocrystalline Y2O3:Eu3+ was studied in contrast with the polycrystalline powders. The emission intensity of Eu3+ decreased solely with elevated temperature under the excitation of a 580 nm light, while it had a maximum at a certain temperature under a 488 nm light. The experimental data were well fitted based on a theory considering both the thermal activated distribution of electrons among 7FJ and the thermal quenching effect. The results indicated that the thermal quenching rate in nanocrystals (NCs) was faster than that in the polycrystals. The nonradiative decay rate, wNR, the radiative transition rate, w0R, and the luminescent quantum efficiency (QE) were obtained according to the temperature dependence of fluorescence lifetime. It can be concluded that wNR and w0R both increase in NCs, and that QE decreases.",10.1063/1.1538181,AC thermal imaging of a microwire with a fluorescent nanocrystal: Influence of the near field on the thermal contrast,"We have studied the temperature dependence of the visible fluorescence lines of 250 nm large PbF2 nanocrystals codoped with Er3+ and Yb3+ ions. By gluing such a particle at the end of a sharp atomic force microscope tip, we have developed a scanning thermal microscope able to observe the heating of electrically excited micro- and nanowires. By modulating the electrical current that flows in the structure, the resulting temperature variations modulate the particle fluorescence giving rise to the thermal contrast. We will show that the fluorescence is affected both by the near-field optical distribution and by temperature variations. We will show that it is possible to get rid of these optical effects and to keep the thermal contribution by comparing the images to reference images obtained when the device is not driven by a current. The determination of the temperature of the devices is performed by analyzing the thermal quenching of the fluorescent particle and is in good agreement with numerical simulatio...",10.1063/1.3233940,"The methodologies employed in the development of nanothermometers across the five studies demonstrate a variety of approaches to temperature sensing at the nanoscale. In the first study, the fluorescence lifetime of YAG:Ce nanoparticles was measured across a temperature range of 7 to 77°C, revealing a significant variation in lifetime, which indicates their potential as thermographic phosphors (1). The second study innovated by using the rise-time analysis of luminescence from Y2O3:Eu phosphor for 2D thermal imaging, a departure from the conventional lifetime-decay response, and utilized a high-speed camera and Matlab processing to map temperature variations (2). The third paper explored the effect of annealing on the upconversion luminescence of ZnO:Er3+ nanocrystals, finding that annealing temperature significantly enhanced emission intensities and that thermal sensitivity was high, based on temperature-dependent fluorescence intensity ratios (3). The fourth study compared the temperature-dependent luminescent spectra and dynamics of nanocrystalline versus polycrystalline Y2O3:Eu3+, employing a theoretical model to fit the experimental data and quantify nonradiative and radiative transition rates, as well as luminescent quantum efficiency (4). Lastly, the fifth study utilized PbF2 nanocrystals doped with Er3+ and Yb3+ ions attached to an atomic force microscope tip to create a scanning thermal microscope, which could discern thermal contrast in micro- and nanowires by analyzing the thermal quenching of fluorescence, accounting for near-field optical effects (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the diverse strategies in nanothermometry, ranging from fluorescence lifetime analysis to upconversion luminescence and thermal quenching, each contributing to the advancement of precise temperature measurements at the nanoscale.","{

Application of a salt-metathesis protocol employing TptBu,MeLnMe(AlMe4) and the potassium aryloxides KOAr made complexes TptBu,MeLnMe(OAr) accessible for the smaller aryloxy ligands as well.

}",,"In the field of rare-earth complexes, recent research has focused on obtaining various complexes through distinct synthesis protocols (1). For instance, methyl aryloxide complexes TptBu,MeLnMe(OAr) (Ln = Y, Lu) were prepared using protonolysis with phenolic proligands HOC6H2tBu2-2,6-Me-4 or via a salt-metallesis protocol employing TptBu,MeLnMe(AlMe4) and potassium aryloxides (1). Meanwhile, redox-transmetallation was used to obtain divalent NHC–lanthanide complexes without oxidation of the metal center (2). Additionally, multinuclear lanthanide-implanted tetrameric Dawson-type phosphotungstates with switchable luminescence behaviors were synthesized using a one-step assembly strategy and characterized by various techniques (3). These complexes exhibit reversible photochromism, which can change from intrinsic white to blue for 6 minutes upon UV irradiation. Furthermore, discrete lanthanide-based self-assembled complexes in solution were developed to emit pure white light with CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.34) by fine-tuning the lanthanide ions molar ratio and utilizing the intrinsic blue fluorescence of the ligand (4). Lastly, anilido-oxazoline-ligated rare-earth metal complexes were synthesized and characterized for their strong fluorescence emissions and good catalytic performance on isoprene polymerization with high cis-1,4-selectivity (5).

1064,Artificial Intelligence,Computer Sciences,Exploring Evaluation Benchmarks for Large Language Models,CUAD: An Expert-Annotated NLP Dataset for Legal Contract Review,"Many specialized domains remain untouched by deep learning, as large labeled datasets require expensive expert annotators. We address this bottleneck within the legal domain by introducing the Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD), a new dataset for legal contract review. CUAD was created with dozens of legal experts from The Atticus Project and consists of over 13,000 annotations. The task is to highlight salient portions of a contract that are important for a human to review. We find that Transformer models have nascent performance, but that this performance is strongly influenced by model design and training dataset size. Despite these promising results, there is still substantial room for improvement. As one of the only large, specialized NLP benchmarks annotated by experts, CUAD can serve as a challenging research benchmark for the broader NLP community.",,PromptBench: Towards Evaluating the Robustness of Large Language Models on Adversarial Prompts,"The increasing reliance on Large Language Models (LLMs) across academia and industry necessitates a comprehensive understanding of their robustness to prompts. In response to this vital need, we introduce PromptBench, a robustness benchmark designed to measure LLMs' resilience to adversarial prompts. This study uses a plethora of adversarial textual attacks targeting prompts across multiple levels: character, word, sentence, and semantic. The adversarial prompts, crafted to mimic plausible user errors like typos or synonyms, aim to evaluate how slight deviations can affect LLM outcomes while maintaining semantic integrity. These prompts are then employed in diverse tasks, such as sentiment analysis, natural language inference, reading comprehension, machine translation, and math problem-solving. Our study generates 4788 adversarial prompts, meticulously evaluated over 8 tasks and 13 datasets. Our findings demonstrate that contemporary LLMs are not robust to adversarial prompts. Furthermore, we present comprehensive analysis to understand the mystery behind prompt robustness and its transferability. We then offer insightful robustness analysis and pragmatic recommendations for prompt composition, beneficial to both researchers and everyday users. Code is available at: https://github.com/microsoft/promptbench.",10.48550/arXiv.2306.04528,C-Eval: A Multi-Level Multi-Discipline Chinese Evaluation Suite for Foundation Models,"New NLP benchmarks are urgently needed to align with the rapid development of large language models (LLMs). We present C-Eval, the first comprehensive Chinese evaluation suite designed to assess advanced knowledge and reasoning abilities of foundation models in a Chinese context. C-Eval comprises multiple-choice questions across four difficulty levels: middle school, high school, college, and professional. The questions span 52 diverse disciplines, ranging from humanities to science and engineering. C-Eval is accompanied by C-Eval Hard, a subset of very challenging subjects in C-Eval that requires advanced reasoning abilities to solve. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the most advanced LLMs on C-Eval, including both English- and Chinese-oriented models. Results indicate that only GPT-4 could achieve an average accuracy of over 60%, suggesting that there is still significant room for improvement for current LLMs. We anticipate C-Eval will help analyze important strengths and shortcomings of foundation models, and foster their development and growth for Chinese users.",10.48550/arXiv.2305.08322,Wider and Deeper LLM Networks are Fairer LLM Evaluators,"Measuring the quality of responses generated by LLMs is a challenging task, particularly when it comes to evaluating whether the response is aligned with human preference. A novel approach involves using the LLM itself to make evaluation and stabilizing the results through multiple independent evaluations, similar to a single-layer narrow LLM network. This network consists of a fixed number of neurons, with each neuron being the same LLM. In this paper, we draw upon the extensive research on deep neural networks to explore whether deeper and wider networks can lead to fairer evaluations. Specifically, inspired by the observation that different neurons in a neural network are responsible for detecting different concepts, we first adaptively generate as many neuron roles as possible for each evaluation sample. Each perspective corresponds to the role of a specific LLM neuron in the first layer. In subsequent layers, we follow the idea that higher layers in deep networks are responsible for more comprehensive features, each layer receives representations from all neurons in the previous layer, integrating the locally learned evaluation information to obtain a more comprehensive evaluation result. Interestingly, this network design resembles the process of academic paper reviewing. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we construct the largest and most diverse English evaluation benchmark LLMEval$^2$ for LLM evaluators, comprising 15 tasks, 8 abilities, and 2,553 samples. Experimental results demonstrate that a wider network (involving many reviewers) with 2 layers (one round of discussion) performs the best, improving kappa correlation coefficient from 0.28 to 0.34. We also leverage WideDeep to aid in the assessment of Chinese LLMs, which has accelerated the evaluation time by 4.6 times, resulting in a 60% cost saving. WideDeep achieves a remarkable 93% agreement level among humans.",10.48550/arXiv.2308.01862,Emotionally Numb or Empathetic? Evaluating How LLMs Feel Using EmotionBench,"Recently, the community has witnessed the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have shown remarkable performance on various downstream tasks. Led by powerful models like ChatGPT and Claude, LLMs are revolutionizing how users engage with software, assuming more than mere tools but intelligent assistants. Consequently, evaluating LLMs' anthropomorphic capabilities becomes increasingly important in contemporary discourse. Utilizing the emotion appraisal theory from psychology, we propose to evaluate the empathy ability of LLMs, i.e., how their feelings change when presented with specific situations. After a careful and comprehensive survey, we collect a dataset containing over 400 situations that have proven effective in eliciting the eight emotions central to our study. Categorizing the situations into 36 factors, we conduct a human evaluation involving more than 1,200 subjects worldwide. With the human evaluation results as references, our evaluation includes five LLMs, covering both commercial and open-source models, including variations in model sizes, featuring the latest iterations, such as GPT-4 and LLaMA 2. A conclusion can be drawn from the results that, despite several misalignments, LLMs can generally respond appropriately to certain situations. Nevertheless, they fall short in alignment with the emotional behaviors of human beings and cannot establish connections between similar situations. Our collected dataset of situations, the human evaluation results, and the code of our testing framework, dubbed EmotionBench, is made publicly in https://github.com/CUHK-ARISE/EmotionBench. We aspire to contribute to the advancement of LLMs regarding better alignment with the emotional behaviors of human beings, thereby enhancing their utility and applicability as intelligent assistants.",10.48550/arXiv.2308.03656,"In the quest to establish robust evaluation benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have employed diverse methodologies tailored to specific domains and capabilities. The CUAD benchmark leverages expert annotations to assess LLMs in the legal domain, focusing on the importance of model design and training dataset size for performance (1). PromptBench introduces a robustness benchmark that evaluates LLMs against adversarial prompts across multiple levels, using a wide array of tasks and datasets to measure the models' resilience to slight deviations in input (2). C-Eval, on the other hand, presents a multi-level, multi-discipline Chinese evaluation suite, assessing advanced knowledge and reasoning abilities across various disciplines, and highlighting the performance gap in current LLMs (3). The methodology of using wider and deeper LLM networks as evaluators draws inspiration from neural network research, suggesting that such networks can integrate multiple perspectives for a fairer and more comprehensive evaluation, as demonstrated by the LLMEval$^2$ benchmark (4). Lastly, EmotionBench evaluates the anthropomorphic capabilities of LLMs, particularly empathy, by comparing model responses to human evaluations across a dataset of situations designed to elicit specific emotions (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of domain-specificity, adversarial robustness, cultural context, multi-perspective evaluation, and anthropomorphic capabilities in developing comprehensive benchmarks for LLMs.","{

1067,Databases/Information Systems,Computer Sciences,SPARQL query optimization,JOTR: Join-Optimistic Triple Reordering Approach for SPARQL Query Optimization on Big RDF Data,"Resource Description Framework (RDF) is increasingly being used for representing information on the web. This popularity has made storage of large RDF data a difficult task. To overcome these issues many distributed RDF systems are being proposed that can store and efficiently process Big RDF data. Hadoop framework is widely being used for storing and handling a large amount of RDF data. One of the major obstacles faced while handling this large amount of RDF data is query processing on such large datasets. In this paper, we present JOTR: a SPARQL query optimization technique for Big RDF data using triple pattern reordering on a distributed Hadoop based RDF system. The proposed technique is based on selectivity calculation and has been tested on one of the popular RDF benchmark datasets, LUBM dataset. We have tested JOTR on large sized RDF datasets and compared it with other optimization approaches in respect to the query execution time. From the results, it can be concluded that our approach gives a notable performance on distributed RDF systems and thus is applicable to centralized systems as well.",10.1109/icccnt.2018.8493743,Traveling Light — A Low-Overhead Approach for SPARQL Query Optimization,"SPARQL query processing in triplestores has to deal with many of the same problems as query processing in relational databases, and additional problems due to the schema relaxed nature of RDF. The flexible pattern matching capabilities of SPARQL queries entail performance challenges for complex queries. Most modern query optimizers produce a significant overhead as they use an exhaustive statistics generation and storage approach. Currently, there is no pure online cost-based optimizer for SPARQL queries. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that just storing selectivity statistics for predicates enables effective optimization of typical queries. Based on this, we introduce a pure online optimizer for triplestores, the Online Join Order Optimizer (OJOO), which learns from query executions. OJOO's overhead in creating and persisting statistics is very low, and it provides an easily extendable storage architecture for statistics. We implemented the OJOO in a main-memory triplestore, PDStore (Parsimonious Data Store), and evaluated its performance experimentally using the Lehigh University Benchmark (LUBM). Our experimental results revealed that the OJOO is competitive, efficient, scalable, and has a negligible runtime overhead.",10.1109/icsc50631.2021.00014,Scalable SPARQL querying of large RDF graphs,"The generation of RDF data has accelerated to the point where many data sets need to be partitioned across multiple machines in order to achieve reasonable performance when querying the data. Although tremendous progress has been made in the Semantic Web community for achieving high performance data management on a single node, current solutions that allow the data to be partitioned across multiple machines are highly inefficient. In this paper, we introduce a scalable RDF data management system that is up to three orders of magnitude more efficient than popular multi-node RDF data management systems. In so doing, we introduce techniques for (1) leveraging state-of-the-art single node RDF-store technology (2) partitioning the data across nodes in a manner that helps accelerate query processing through locality optimizations and (3) decomposing SPARQL queries into high performance fragments that take advantage of how data is partitioned in a cluster.",10.14778/3402707.3402747,SPARQL Query Optimization on Top of DHTs,"Abstract. We study the problem of SPARQL query optimization on top of distributed hash tables. Existing works on SPARQL query processing in such environments have never been implemented in a real system, or do not utilize any optimization techniques and thus exhibit poor perfor-mance. Our goal in this paper is to propose efficient and scalable algo-rithms for optimizing SPARQL basic graph pattern queries. We augment a known distributed query processing algorithm with query optimization strategies that improve performance in terms of query response time and bandwidth usage. We implement our techniques in the system Atlas and study their performance experimentally in a local cluster.",10.1007/978-3-642-17746-0_27,SPARQL basic graph pattern optimization using selectivity estimation,"In this paper, we formalize the problem of Basic Graph Pattern (BGP) optimization for SPARQL queries and main memory graph implementations of RDF data. We define and analyze the characteristics of heuristics for selectivity-based static BGP optimization. The heuristics range from simple triple pattern variable counting to more sophisticated selectivity estimation techniques. Customized summary statistics for RDF data enable the selectivity estimation of joined triple patterns and the development of efficient heuristics. Using the Lehigh University Benchmark (LUBM), we evaluate the performance of the heuristics for the queries provided by the LUBM and discuss some of them in more details.",10.1145/1367497.1367578,"In addressing the challenge of SPARQL query optimization, various methodologies have been employed to enhance the performance of query processing on large RDF datasets. The JOTR approach utilizes triple pattern reordering based on selectivity calculation, demonstrating significant performance improvements on distributed Hadoop-based RDF systems (1). Similarly, the Online Join Order Optimizer (OJOO) adopts a low-overhead strategy, relying on predicate selectivity statistics and learning from query executions to optimize queries in a main-memory triplestore, achieving competitive results with minimal runtime overhead (2). In contrast, a scalable RDF data management system leverages single-node RDF-store technology, data partitioning for locality optimizations, and query decomposition to enhance query processing across multiple machines, achieving orders of magnitude efficiency gains (3). Optimization on top of distributed hash tables (DHTs) involves augmenting distributed query processing algorithms with strategies that reduce query response time and bandwidth usage, as implemented in the Atlas system (4). Lastly, selectivity estimation for Basic Graph Pattern (BGP) optimization employs heuristics ranging from variable counting to sophisticated techniques using customized summary statistics, which have been evaluated using the LUBM benchmark (5). Collectively, these methodologies contribute to the research problem by focusing on selectivity-based optimization, distributed processing enhancements, and the use of heuristics and statistics to improve the efficiency and scalability of SPARQL query execution.","{

}","The challenge of optimizing SPARQL queries for large RDF datasets is a critical concern in the realm of semantic web technologies, with several studies proposing innovative solutions to enhance query performance. A recurring theme is the use of selectivity-based optimization techniques, which reorder triple patterns to minimize query execution time (1, 5). The JOTR approach, for instance, leverages selectivity calculations to improve the efficiency of distributed Hadoop-based RDF systems, demonstrating significant performance gains on benchmark datasets (1). Similarly, the concept of low-overhead optimization is explored through the Online Join Order Optimizer (OJOO), which relies on predicate selectivity statistics and adapts based on query executions, achieving competitive results with minimal runtime overhead (2). Scalability is another focal point, with strategies that partition RDF data across multiple nodes to exploit data locality and decompose SPARQL queries into fragments for optimized execution in distributed environments, yielding substantial efficiency improvements (3). Furthermore, the optimization of SPARQL queries on top of distributed hash tables (DHTs) is addressed by integrating optimization strategies into distributed query processing algorithms, enhancing response times and reducing bandwidth usage (4). Collectively, these studies underscore the importance of selectivity estimation and data partitioning strategies in achieving scalable and efficient SPARQL query processing across various storage architectures (1-5).","{

1073,Graphics,Computer Sciences,Scholarly Ontologies,ScholOnto: an ontology-based digital library server for research documents and discourse,"The internet is rapidly becoming the first place for researchers to publish documents, but at present they receive little support in searching, tracking, analysing or debating concepts in a literature from scholarly perspectives. This paper describes the design rationale and implementation of ScholOnto, an ontology-based digital library server to support scholarly interpretation and discourse. It enables researchers to describe and debate via a semantic network the contributions a document makes, and its relationship to the literature. The paper discusses the computational services that an ontology-based server supports, alternative user interfaces to support interaction with a large semantic network, usability issues associated with knowledge formalisation, new work practices that could emerge, and related work",10.1007/s007990000034,FaBiO and CiTO: Ontologies for describing bibliographic resources and citations,"Semantic publishing is the use of Web and Semantic Web technologies to enhance the meaning of a published journal article, to facilitate its automated discovery, to enable its linking to semantically related articles, to provide access to data within the article in actionable form, and to facilitate integration of data between articles. Recently, semantic publishing has opened the possibility of a major step forward in the digital publishing world. For this to succeed, new semantic models and visualization tools are required to fully meet the specific needs of authors and publishers. In this article, we introduce the principles and architectures of two new ontologies central to the task of semantic publishing: FaBiO, the FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology, an ontology for recording and publishing bibliographic records of scholarly endeavours on the Semantic Web, and CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology, an ontology for the characterization of bibliographic citations both factually and rhetorically. We present those two models step by step, in order to emphasise their features and to stress their advantages relative to other pre-existing information models. Finally, we review the uptake of FaBiO and CiTO within the academic and publishing communities",10.1016/j.websem.2012.08.001,An ontology of scientific experiments,"The formal description of experiments for efficient analysis, annotation and sharing of results is a fundamental part of the practice of science. Ontologies are required to achieve this objective. A few subject-specific ontologies of experiments currently exist. However, despite the unity of scientific experimentation, no general ontology of experiments exists. We propose the ontology EXPO to meet this need. EXPO links the SUMO (the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology) with subject-specific ontologies of experiments by formalizing the generic concepts of experimental design, methodology and results representation. EXPO is expressed in the W3C standard ontology language OWL-DL. We demonstrate the utility of EXPO and its ability to describe different experimental domains, by applying it to two experiments: one in high-energy physics and the other in phylogenetics. The use of EXPO made the goals and structure of these experiments more explicit, revealed ambiguities, and highlighted an unexpected similarity. We conclude that, EXPO is of general value in describing experiments and a step towards the formalization of science.",10.1098/rsif.2006.0134,The Document Components Ontology (DoCO),"The availability in machine-readable form of descriptions of the structure of documents, as well as of the document
discourse (e.g. the scientific discourse within scholarly articles), is crucial for facilitating semantic publishing and the overall
comprehension of documents by both users and machines. In this paper we introduce DoCO, the Document Components Ontology,
an OWL 2 DL ontology that provides a general-purpose structured vocabulary of document elements to describe both structural and
rhetorical document components in RDF. In addition to describing the formal description of the ontology, this paper showcases its
utility in practice in a variety of our own applications and other activities of the Semantic Publishing community that rely on DoCO
to annotate and retrieve document components of scholarly articles.",10.3233/SW-150177,The SPAR Ontologies,"AbstractOver the past eight years, we have been involved in the development of a set of complementary and orthogonal ontologies that can be used for the description of the main areas of the scholarly publishing domain, known as the SPAR (Semantic Publishing and Referencing) Ontologies. In this paper, we introduce this suite of ontologies, discuss the basic principles we have followed for their development, and describe their uptake and usage within the academic, institutional and publishing communities.",10.1007/978-3-030-00668-6_8,"In addressing the research problem of scholarly ontologies, the methodologies employed across the five papers demonstrate a commitment to enhancing the semantic richness and interoperability of scholarly communication. ScholOnto utilizes an ontology-based digital library server to support scholarly interpretation and discourse, focusing on the design rationale and implementation of computational services and user interfaces to interact with a semantic network (1). FaBiO and CiTO ontologies are introduced with a step-by-step presentation of their principles and architectures, emphasizing their features and advantages for semantic publishing, including the recording and characterization of bibliographic records and citations (2). EXPO, an ontology of scientific experiments, is methodologically linked to the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO) and applied to diverse experimental domains to demonstrate its utility in making experimental goals and structures explicit (3). The Document Components Ontology (DoCO) is developed as an OWL 2 DL ontology to describe document elements, showcasing its utility in semantic publishing and document comprehension through practical applications and community activities (4). Lastly, the SPAR Ontologies are introduced as a suite of complementary and orthogonal ontologies developed over eight years, with a focus on their development principles and their uptake within various communities (5). Collectively, these methodologies contribute to the research problem by providing structured vocabularies, formalizing scholarly discourse, and facilitating the integration and analysis of research documents and data.","{

1074,Graphics,Computer Sciences,Graph-based visualization systems,graphVizdb: A Scalable Platform for Interactive Large Graph Visualization.,"We present a novel platform for the interactive visualization of very large graphs. The platform enables the user to interact with the visualized graph in a way that is very similar to the exploration of maps at multiple levels. Our approach involves an offline preprocessing phase that builds the layout of the graph by assigning coordinates to its nodes with respect to a Euclidean plane. The respective points are indexed with a spatial data structure, i.e., an R-tree, and stored in a database. Multiple abstraction layers of the graph based on various criteria are also created offline, and they are indexed similarly so that the user can explore the dataset at different levels of granularity, depending on her particular needs. Then, our system translates user operations into simple and very efficient spatial operations (i.e., window queries) in the backend. This technique allows for a fine-grained access to very large graphs with extremely low latency and memory requirements and without compromising the functionality of the tool. Our web-based prototype supports three main operations: (1) interactive navigation, (2) multi-level exploration, and (3) keyword search on the graph metadata.",10.1109/icde.2016.7498340,"LodLive, exploring the web of data","LodLive project, http://en.lodlive.it/, provides a demonstration of the use of Linked Data standard (RDF, SPARQL) to browse RDF resources. The application aims to spread linked data principles with a simple and friendly interface and reusable techniques. In this report we present an overview of the potential of LodLive, mentioning tools and methodologies that were used to create it.",10.1145/2362499.2362532,RDF data exploration and visualization,"We present Paged Graph Visualization (PGV), a new semi-autonomous tool for RDF data exploration and visualization. PGV consists of two main components: a) the ""PGV explorer"" and b) the ""RDF pager"" module utilizing BRAHMS, our high per-formance main-memory RDF storage system. Unlike existing graph visualization techniques which attempt to display the entire graph and then filter out irrelevant data, PGV begins with a small graph and provides the tools to incrementally explore and visualize relevant data of very large RDF ontologies. We implemented several techniques to visualize and explore hot spots in the graph, i.e. nodes with large numbers of immediate neighbors. In response to the user-controlled, semantics-driven direction of the exploration, the PGV explorer obtains the necessary sub-graphs from the RDF pager and enables their incremental visualization leaving the previously laid out sub-graphs intact. We outline the problem of visualizing large RDF data sets, discuss our interface and its implementation, and through a controlled experiment we show the benefits of PGV.",10.1145/1317353.1317362,Browsing Linked Data with Fenfire,"A wealth of information has recently become available as browsable RDF data on the Web, but the selection of client applications to interact with this Linked Data remains limited. We show how to browse Linked Data with Fenfire, a Free and Open Source Software RDF browser and editor that employs a graph view and focuses on an engaging and interactive browsing experience. This sets Fenfire apart from previous table- and outline-based Linked Data browsers.",,Visualizing Populated Ontologies with OntoTrix,"Research on visualizing Semantic Web data has yielded many tools that rely on information visualization techniques to better support the user in understanding and editing these data. Most tools structure the visualization according to the concept definitions and interrelations that constitute the ontology’s vocabulary. Instances are often treated as somewhat peripheral information, when considered at all. These instances, that populate ontologies, represent an essential part of any knowledge base. Understanding instance-level data might be easier for users because of their higher concreteness, but instances will often be orders of magnitude more numerous than the concept definitions that give them machine-processable meaning. As such, the visualization of instance-level data poses different but real challenges. The authors present a visualization technique designed to enable users to visualize large instance sets and the relations that connect them. This visualization uses both node-link and adjacency matrix representations of graphs to visualize different parts of the data depending on their semantic and local structural properties. The technique was originally devised for simple social network visualization. The authors extend it to handle the richer and more complex graph structures of populated ontologies, exploiting ontological knowledge to drive the layout of, and navigation in, the representation embedded in a smooth zoomable environment.",10.4018/ijswis.2013100102,"In addressing the challenge of graph-based visualization systems, the methodologies employed across the five studies demonstrate a convergence towards interactive, scalable, and user-friendly platforms for handling large and complex graph data. The graphVizdb platform utilizes an offline preprocessing phase to create a spatially indexed, multi-level abstraction of large graphs, enabling efficient exploration through window queries, interactive navigation, and keyword search (1). Similarly, the LodLive project leverages Linked Data standards to provide a simple interface for browsing RDF resources, emphasizing the dissemination of linked data principles (2). Paged Graph Visualization (PGV) introduces a semi-autonomous tool that incrementally visualizes large RDF ontologies, starting with a small graph and expanding based on user-directed exploration, utilizing a high-performance main-memory RDF storage system (3). Fenfire distinguishes itself by offering an interactive graph view for browsing Linked Data, focusing on an engaging user experience (4). Lastly, OntoTrix addresses the visualization of populated ontologies by combining node-link and adjacency matrix representations, tailored to the semantic and structural properties of the data, and facilitating navigation within a zoomable environment (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of scalability, interactivity, and adaptability in graph-based visualization systems, catering to the growing complexity and size of graph datasets.","{

Based on a search in the Scopus digital library, we reportfrom an analysis of peer-reviewed systematic literature reviews and mapping studies to showcase majorareas of RE research that use methods from the Empirical Software Engineering paradigm. We summarizeprior empirical research in RE and introduce the contributors to this special issue on empirical researchmethodologies and studies in RE",10.1016/j.jss.2014.06.035,Research in software engineering: an analysis of the literature,"In this paper, we examine the state of software engineering (SE) research from the point of view of the following research questions: 1. What topics do SE researchers address? 2. What research approaches do SE researchers use? 3. What research methods do SE researchers use? 4. On what reference disciplines does SE research depend? 5. At what levels of analysis do SE researchers conduct research? To answer those questions, we examined 369 papers in six leading research journals in the SE field, answering those research questions for each paper. From that examination, we conclude that SE research is diverse regarding topic, narrow regarding research approach and method, inwardly-focused regarding reference discipline, and technically focused (as opposed to behaviorally focused) regarding level of analysis. We pass no judgment on the SE field as a result of these findings. Instead, we present them as groundwork for future SE research efforts",10.1016/s0950-5849(02)00049-6,Support mechanisms to conduct empirical studies in software engineering: a systematic mapping study,"Context: Empirical studies are gaining recognition in the Software Engineering (SE) research community, allowing improved quality of research and accelerating the adoption of new technologies in the software market. However, empirical studies in this area are still limited. In order to foster empirical research in SE, it is essential to understand the resources available to aid these studies. Goal: Identify support mechanisms (methodology, tool, guideline, process, etc.) used to conduct empirical studies in the Empirical Software Engineering (ESE) community. Method: We performed a systematic mapping study that included all full papers published at EASE, ESEM and ESEJ since their first editions. Were selected 891 studies between 1996 and 2013. Results: A total of 375 support mechanisms were identified. We provide the full list of mechanisms and the strategies that uses them. Despite this, we identified a high number of studies that do not cite any mechanism to support their empirical strategies: 433 studies (48%). Experiment is the strategy that has more resources to support their activities. And guideline was the most used type of mechanism. Moreover we observed that the most mechanisms used as reference to empirical studies are not specific to SE area. And some mechanisms were used only in specific activities of empirical research, such as statistical and qualitative data analysis. Experiment and case studies are the strategies most applied. Conclusions: The use of empirical methods in SE has increased over the years. Despite this, many studies did not apply these methods and do not cite any resource to guide their research. Therefore, the list of support mechanisms, where and how they were applied is a major asset to the SE community. Such asset can encourage empirical studies aiding the choice regarding which strategies and mechanisms to use in a research, as well as pointing out examples where they were used, mainly to novice researchers. We also identified new perspectives and gaps that foster other research for the improvement of empirical research in this area.",10.1145/2745802.2745823,An Analysis of Empirical Requirements Engineering Survey Data,"The gap between research and practice in requirements engineering is immense. To understand practice and the reasons for this gap, empirical evidence about requirements engineering practice is needed. In the last ten years a number of empirical studies have been conducted to gather such data. This chapter gives an overview focusing on broad surveys. The aim of this overview is to understand the following three issues: (1) what kind of questions can and should we ask to understand practice, (2) what evidence do we have about practice, (3) what further evidence do we need about practice. To further illustrate the issues, we provide findings of new studies conducted by the authors in Germany and Australia. Altogether this chapter aims at establishing a basis for further empirical research on requirements engineering",10.1007/3-540-28244-0_19,Empirical Strategies in Software Engineering Research: A Literature Survey,"Context: The Software Engineering (SE) research continues to gain strength and interest for researchers considering the need to apply rigor and scientific validity to research results. Objective: Establishing an overview of the topic through a classification scheme of publications and structure the field of interest. Method: We conducted a Systematic Mapping Study, including articles published until 2019, that report at least one study of empirical strategies in SE. Results: 80 initial sets of studies were selected and analyzed, identifying: i) empirical strategy type used and ii) Software Engineering hypotheses types used. Also, 20 papers of the set of studies for mapping were selected and analyzed, identifying 17 empirical strategies and 11 main characteristics to address the empirical research inception in SE. Conclusions: We corroborate that the selection of an empirical strategy in Software Engineering research depends on the nature and scope of the research and on the resources that the researcher has at that moment, in addition to the degree of scientific and methodological knowledge that he has to carry out an empirical study. It is necessary to continue studying in-depth the behavior and nature of the empirical strategies in Software Engineering research that allows strengthening the scientific taxonomy in SE, besides walking towards the automation of the experimental process.",10.1109/ICI2ST51859.2021.00025,"Empirical research in software engineering (SE) has evolved to embrace diverse methodologies, yet it exhibits a tendency towards certain research strategies and a need for more comprehensive support mechanisms. The analysis of literature in SE reveals a predilection for technical over behavioral analysis, with a narrow range of research approaches and methods, suggesting a potential for broadening empirical research practices (2). In requirements engineering (RE), empirical studies have been instrumental in understanding practices and bridging the gap between research and practice, with surveys being a common method to gather broad data (1, 4). A systematic mapping study highlights the increasing use of empirical methods in SE, yet also points out a significant number of studies that do not reference any support mechanisms for their empirical strategies, indicating a gap in methodological guidance (3). This gap is further evidenced by the finding that many support mechanisms are not specific to SE, and some are only used for particular activities like statistical and qualitative data analysis (3). A literature survey on empirical strategies in SE research underscores the importance of selecting an empirical strategy based on the research's nature and scope, the researcher's resources, and their methodological knowledge (5). This survey also calls for a deeper understanding of empirical strategies to strengthen the scientific taxonomy in SE and suggests moving towards the automation of the experimental process (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the need for a more diverse and well-supported methodological framework in empirical SE research to enhance its rigor and relevance (1-5).","{

}","Empirical research in software engineering (SE) has evolved to become a cornerstone for understanding and improving the field, yet it faces challenges in diversity of application and methodological support. Studies have shown that SE research spans a wide range of topics but tends to be narrow in research approaches and methods, often relying on the field's own disciplines rather than incorporating external ones, and is predominantly technically rather than behaviorally focused (2). Despite the recognition of empirical studies in enhancing research quality and facilitating technology adoption, nearly half of such studies do not reference any support mechanisms, indicating a gap in the application of empirical methods (3). The Requirements Engineering (RE) community, in particular, has made significant strides in empirical research since 1992, utilizing systematic literature reviews and mapping studies to understand RE phenomena and validate research results (1). However, there is a noted gap between research and practice in RE, with empirical surveys revealing the need for more evidence about practice to bridge this divide (4). Furthermore, the selection of empirical strategies in SE research is influenced by the research's nature and scope, the resources available, and the researcher's methodological knowledge, suggesting a need for a more robust scientific taxonomy and possibly the automation of the experimental process (5). These findings underscore the importance of diversifying research approaches, integrating support mechanisms, and fostering a closer alignment between research and practice in the empirical study of software engineering.","{

}","Empirical research has played a significant role in advancing knowledge in Requirements Engineering (RE) and Software Engineering (SE), with numerous studies conducted to understand various aspects of these fields and evaluate the effectiveness of proposed solutions. According to a systematic literature review in Paper 1, empirical RE research has progressed since its inception in 1992, focusing on areas such as requirements elicitation, documentation, validation, and verification (1). In contrast, Paper 2 analyzed 369 SE papers from six leading journals and found that while the field is diverse regarding topics, it is narrow in research approach and method, with a focus on technically-oriented analysis rather than behavioral aspects (2).

To foster empirical research in SE, Paper 3 conducted a systematic mapping study identifying 375 support mechanisms used to conduct empirical studies between 1996 and 2013. Experiment and guideline were the most commonly used strategies, with experiment being the most supported (3). However, over half of the studies did not cite any mechanism for their research (3).

Papers 4 and 5 further emphasize the importance of empirical evidence in understanding RE and SE practice. Paper 4 provides an overview of broad surveys on requirements engineering practice, focusing on issues such as what questions to ask, available evidence, and required future evidence (4). Similarly, Paper 5 conducted a systematic mapping study on empirical strategies in SE research, identifying 17 strategies and their characteristics (5).

In conclusion, empirical research methodologies have been extensively used in RE and SE research to gain knowledge about various aspects of these fields and evaluate the effectiveness of proposed solutions. Support mechanisms such as experiment and guideline are essential resources for conducting empirical studies, with a need for more studies to utilize these resources effectively (3). Continued research is necessary to deepen our understanding of the behavior and nature of empirical strategies in RE and SE, ultimately contributing to the improvement of both fields.

1078,Software Engineering,Computer Sciences,empirical research in software engineering,Empirical research methodologies and studies in Requirements Engineering: How far did we come?,"Since the inception of the RE conference series (1992), both researchers and practitioners in the RE com-munity have acknowledged the significance of empirical evaluation as an instrument to gain knowledgeabout various aspects of RE phenomena and the validity of our research results. A significant number ofempirical studies have been conducted in the search for knowledge about RE problems as well as evidenceof successful and less successful application of proposed solutions. This editorial presents the progressempirical RE research has made since 1992. Based on a search in the Scopus digital library, we reportfrom an analysis of peer-reviewed systematic literature reviews and mapping studies to showcase majorareas of RE research that use methods from the Empirical Software Engineering paradigm. We summarizeprior empirical research in RE and introduce the contributors to this special issue on empirical researchmethodologies and studies in RE",10.1016/j.jss.2014.06.035,Support mechanisms to conduct empirical studies in software engineering: a systematic mapping study,"Context: Empirical studies are gaining recognition in the Software Engineering (SE) research community, allowing improved quality of research and accelerating the adoption of new technologies in the software market. However, empirical studies in this area are still limited. In order to foster empirical research in SE, it is essential to understand the resources available to aid these studies. Goal: Identify support mechanisms (methodology, tool, guideline, process, etc.) used to conduct empirical studies in the Empirical Software Engineering (ESE) community. Method: We performed a systematic mapping study that included all full papers published at EASE, ESEM and ESEJ since their first editions. Were selected 891 studies between 1996 and 2013. Results: A total of 375 support mechanisms were identified. We provide the full list of mechanisms and the strategies that uses them. Despite this, we identified a high number of studies that do not cite any mechanism to support their empirical strategies: 433 studies (48%). Experiment is the strategy that has more resources to support their activities. And guideline was the most used type of mechanism. Moreover we observed that the most mechanisms used as reference to empirical studies are not specific to SE area. And some mechanisms were used only in specific activities of empirical research, such as statistical and qualitative data analysis. Experiment and case studies are the strategies most applied. Conclusions: The use of empirical methods in SE has increased over the years. Despite this, many studies did not apply these methods and do not cite any resource to guide their research. Therefore, the list of support mechanisms, where and how they were applied is a major asset to the SE community. Such asset can encourage empirical studies aiding the choice regarding which strategies and mechanisms to use in a research, as well as pointing out examples where they were used, mainly to novice researchers. We also identified new perspectives and gaps that foster other research for the improvement of empirical research in this area.",10.1145/2745802.2745823,An Analysis of Empirical Requirements Engineering Survey Data,"The gap between research and practice in requirements engineering is immense. To understand practice and the reasons for this gap, empirical evidence about requirements engineering practice is needed. In the last ten years a number of empirical studies have been conducted to gather such data. This chapter gives an overview focusing on broad surveys. The aim of this overview is to understand the following three issues: (1) what kind of questions can and should we ask to understand practice, (2) what evidence do we have about practice, (3) what further evidence do we need about practice. To further illustrate the issues, we provide findings of new studies conducted by the authors in Germany and Australia. Altogether this chapter aims at establishing a basis for further empirical research on requirements engineering",10.1007/3-540-28244-0_19,The type of evidence produced by empirical software engineers,"This paper reports on the research published between the years 1997 and 2003 inclusive in the journal of Empirical Software Engineering, drawing on the taxonomy developed by Glass et al. in [3]. We found that the research was somewhat narrow in topic with about half the papers focusing on measurement/metrics, review and inspection; that researchers were almost as interested in formulating as in evaluating; that hypothesis testing and laboratory experiments dominated evaluations; that research was not very likely to focus on people and extremely unlikely to refer to other disciplines. We discuss our findings in the context of making empirical software engineering more relevant to practitioners.",10.1145/1082983.1083176,Empirical Strategies in Software Engineering Research: A Literature Survey,"Context: The Software Engineering (SE) research continues to gain strength and interest for researchers considering the need to apply rigor and scientific validity to research results. Objective: Establishing an overview of the topic through a classification scheme of publications and structure the field of interest. Method: We conducted a Systematic Mapping Study, including articles published until 2019, that report at least one study of empirical strategies in SE. Results: 80 initial sets of studies were selected and analyzed, identifying: i) empirical strategy type used and ii) Software Engineering hypotheses types used. Also, 20 papers of the set of studies for mapping were selected and analyzed, identifying 17 empirical strategies and 11 main characteristics to address the empirical research inception in SE. Conclusions: We corroborate that the selection of an empirical strategy in Software Engineering research depends on the nature and scope of the research and on the resources that the researcher has at that moment, in addition to the degree of scientific and methodological knowledge that he has to carry out an empirical study. It is necessary to continue studying in-depth the behavior and nature of the empirical strategies in Software Engineering research that allows strengthening the scientific taxonomy in SE, besides walking towards the automation of the experimental process.",10.1109/ICI2ST51859.2021.00025,"Empirical research in software engineering (SE) has evolved to embrace a variety of methodologies, each contributing uniquely to the understanding of SE phenomena and the validation of research results. Systematic literature reviews and mapping studies have been instrumental in identifying major areas of empirical research in requirements engineering (RE), revealing a progression in empirical methodologies since 1992 (1). A systematic mapping study highlighted the importance of support mechanisms, such as guidelines and tools, for conducting empirical studies, noting a significant number of studies that do not reference any such mechanisms, which suggests a need for better dissemination and adoption of these resources (2). Surveys have been used to bridge the gap between research and practice in RE, aiming to understand practices and the reasons for gaps, with broad surveys providing a foundation for further empirical research (3). Analysis of research published in the Empirical Software Engineering journal indicates a dominance of hypothesis testing and laboratory experiments, with a call for diversification in topics and methodologies to increase relevance to practitioners (4). Finally, a literature survey on empirical strategies in SE research confirms that the choice of empirical strategy is contingent upon the research's nature, scope, and available resources, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of these strategies to strengthen the scientific taxonomy in SE (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the importance of methodological diversity, support mechanisms, and the alignment of research strategies with practical relevance to advance empirical research in software engineering.","{

}","Empirical research in software engineering (SE) has evolved significantly, with a growing recognition of its importance for understanding practices and validating research results (1, 2). Studies have shown a trend towards increased use of empirical methods, such as experiments and case studies, to gather evidence about SE practices and the application of proposed solutions (2, 3). However, despite the availability of numerous support mechanisms, nearly half of the studies do not reference any resources to guide their empirical research, indicating a gap in the application of empirical methods (2). The types of evidence produced by empirical software engineers often focus on measurement/metrics, review, and inspection, with a strong inclination towards hypothesis testing and laboratory experiments (4). This suggests a need for diversifying research topics and incorporating interdisciplinary references to enhance relevance to practitioners (4). Furthermore, the selection of empirical strategies in SE research is influenced by the nature and scope of the research, available resources, and the researcher's methodological knowledge (5). To strengthen the scientific taxonomy in SE and potentially automate the experimental process, there is a need for continued in-depth study of the behavior and nature of empirical strategies in SE research (5).

1079,Software Engineering,Computer Sciences,empirical research in software engineering,Empirical Strategies in Software Engineering Research: A Literature Survey,"Context: The Software Engineering (SE) research continues to gain strength and interest for researchers considering the need to apply rigor and scientific validity to research results. Objective: Establishing an overview of the topic through a classification scheme of publications and structure the field of interest. Method: We conducted a Systematic Mapping Study, including articles published until 2019, that report at least one study of empirical strategies in SE. Results: 80 initial sets of studies were selected and analyzed, identifying: i) empirical strategy type used and ii) Software Engineering hypotheses types used. Also, 20 papers of the set of studies for mapping were selected and analyzed, identifying 17 empirical strategies and 11 main characteristics to address the empirical research inception in SE. Conclusions: We corroborate that the selection of an empirical strategy in Software Engineering research depends on the nature and scope of the research and on the resources that the researcher has at that moment, in addition to the degree of scientific and methodological knowledge that he has to carry out an empirical study. It is necessary to continue studying in-depth the behavior and nature of the empirical strategies in Software Engineering research that allows strengthening the scientific taxonomy in SE, besides walking towards the automation of the experimental process.",10.1109/ICI2ST51859.2021.00025,Research in software engineering: an analysis of the literature,"In this paper, we examine the state of software engineering (SE) research from the point of view of the following research questions: 1. What topics do SE researchers address? 2. What research approaches do SE researchers use? 3. What research methods do SE researchers use? 4. On what reference disciplines does SE research depend? 5. At what levels of analysis do SE researchers conduct research? To answer those questions, we examined 369 papers in six leading research journals in the SE field, answering those research questions for each paper. From that examination, we conclude that SE research is diverse regarding topic, narrow regarding research approach and method, inwardly-focused regarding reference discipline, and technically focused (as opposed to behaviorally focused) regarding level of analysis. We pass no judgment on the SE field as a result of these findings. Instead, we present them as groundwork for future SE research efforts",10.1016/s0950-5849(02)00049-6,Empirical research methodologies and studies in Requirements Engineering: How far did we come?,"Since the inception of the RE conference series (1992), both researchers and practitioners in the RE com-munity have acknowledged the significance of empirical evaluation as an instrument to gain knowledgeabout various aspects of RE phenomena and the validity of our research results. A significant number ofempirical studies have been conducted in the search for knowledge about RE problems as well as evidenceof successful and less successful application of proposed solutions. This editorial presents the progressempirical RE research has made since 1992. Based on a search in the Scopus digital library, we reportfrom an analysis of peer-reviewed systematic literature reviews and mapping studies to showcase majorareas of RE research that use methods from the Empirical Software Engineering paradigm. We summarizeprior empirical research in RE and introduce the contributors to this special issue on empirical researchmethodologies and studies in RE",10.1016/j.jss.2014.06.035,Support mechanisms to conduct empirical studies in software engineering: a systematic mapping study,"Context: Empirical studies are gaining recognition in the Software Engineering (SE) research community, allowing improved quality of research and accelerating the adoption of new technologies in the software market. However, empirical studies in this area are still limited. In order to foster empirical research in SE, it is essential to understand the resources available to aid these studies. Goal: Identify support mechanisms (methodology, tool, guideline, process, etc.) used to conduct empirical studies in the Empirical Software Engineering (ESE) community. Method: We performed a systematic mapping study that included all full papers published at EASE, ESEM and ESEJ since their first editions. Were selected 891 studies between 1996 and 2013. Results: A total of 375 support mechanisms were identified. We provide the full list of mechanisms and the strategies that uses them. Despite this, we identified a high number of studies that do not cite any mechanism to support their empirical strategies: 433 studies (48%). Experiment is the strategy that has more resources to support their activities. And guideline was the most used type of mechanism. Moreover we observed that the most mechanisms used as reference to empirical studies are not specific to SE area. And some mechanisms were used only in specific activities of empirical research, such as statistical and qualitative data analysis. Experiment and case studies are the strategies most applied. Conclusions: The use of empirical methods in SE has increased over the years. Despite this, many studies did not apply these methods and do not cite any resource to guide their research. Therefore, the list of support mechanisms, where and how they were applied is a major asset to the SE community. Such asset can encourage empirical studies aiding the choice regarding which strategies and mechanisms to use in a research, as well as pointing out examples where they were used, mainly to novice researchers. We also identified new perspectives and gaps that foster other research for the improvement of empirical research in this area.",10.1145/2745802.2745823,The type of evidence produced by empirical software engineers,"This paper reports on the research published between the years 1997 and 2003 inclusive in the journal of Empirical Software Engineering, drawing on the taxonomy developed by Glass et al. in [3]. We found that the research was somewhat narrow in topic with about half the papers focusing on measurement/metrics, review and inspection; that researchers were almost as interested in formulating as in evaluating; that hypothesis testing and laboratory experiments dominated evaluations; that research was not very likely to focus on people and extremely unlikely to refer to other disciplines. We discuss our findings in the context of making empirical software engineering more relevant to practitioners.",10.1145/1082983.1083176,"Empirical research in software engineering (SE) has evolved with diverse methodologies aimed at enhancing the rigor and relevance of findings. A Systematic Mapping Study conducted by one research team identified 17 empirical strategies and 11 main characteristics, emphasizing the dependency of strategy selection on the research's nature, scope, and available resources (1). Another study analyzed 369 papers, revealing a narrow focus on research approaches and methods, with a technical rather than behavioral emphasis, suggesting a need for broader methodological diversity (2). In the field of Requirements Engineering (RE), a literature review highlighted the progress in empirical research methodologies, indicating a growing recognition of empirical evaluation's significance (3). A systematic mapping study on support mechanisms for empirical studies in SE found 375 mechanisms, yet also noted that many studies did not reference any support resources, indicating a gap in the application of empirical methods (4). Lastly, an analysis of research in the Empirical Software Engineering journal showed a tendency towards hypothesis testing and laboratory experiments, with a call for more practitioner-relevant research (5). Collectively, these studies suggest that while empirical strategies in SE are varied and evolving, there is a need for broader methodological approaches, better utilization of support mechanisms, and a focus on producing evidence that is more relevant to practitioners.","{

In a systematic mapping study (1), the authors identified 17 empirical strategies and 11 main characteristics for addressing empirical research inception in SE. Another study (2) analyzed 369 papers from six leading SE research journals, concluding that SE research is diverse regarding topic but narrow in approach and method, with a focus on technical analysis.

Since the inception of Requirements Engineering (RE) research (3), empirical evaluation has been recognized as an essential instrument for gaining knowledge about RE phenomena and validating research results. A systematic literature review (3) reported that major areas of RE research have employed methods from the Empirical Software Engineering paradigm.

To foster empirical research in SE, a systematic mapping study (4) identified 375 support mechanisms used to conduct empirical studies in the ESE community between 1996 and 2013. Despite the increasing use of empirical methods in SE, many studies did not apply these methods or cite any resource to guide their research (4).

Research published in the journal of Empirical Software Engineering between 1997 and 2003 focused primarily on measurement/metrics, review and inspection, with a preference for hypothesis testing and laboratory experiments (5). These findings highlight the need to expand the scope of empirical research in SE beyond technical analysis and to incorporate more interdisciplinary perspectives.

In summary, empirical strategies have been extensively used in SE research, with a focus on understanding the methodologies employed and their contributions to the field. While there has been an increase in the use of empirical methods in SE, many studies do not apply these methods or cite resources to guide their research. To encourage empirical studies and improve the quality of research results, it is essential to continue studying the behavior and nature of empirical strategies in SE and to foster the adoption of support mechanisms for conducting empirical research.

}",,"Empirical research in software engineering has gained significant attention over the past few decades, with researchers acknowledging the importance of applying rigorous methods and validating results (1). Several studies have been conducted to examine the state of this research field, identifying various topics, approaches, methods, and levels of analysis (2). One area of focus is the use of empirical strategies in software engineering research, which has seen considerable growth but still faces challenges in terms of resources and methodological knowledge (1).

Empirical studies in software engineering have been conducted to evaluate various aspects of software engineering phenomena and the effectiveness of proposed solutions (3). These studies have contributed to the advancement of the field by providing evidence-based insights. However, a systematic mapping study revealed that many studies do not cite any support mechanisms to guide their research (4). This highlights the need for increased awareness and utilization of available resources to foster empirical research in software engineering.

The types of evidence produced by researchers in this field have been analyzed, with a focus on measurement/metrics, formulation, hypothesis testing, and laboratory experiments (5). However, there is a need to expand the scope of empirical research in software engineering to include other disciplines and a greater focus on people. By addressing these gaps, we can continue to strengthen the scientific taxonomy in software engineering and improve the quality and relevance of our research findings.

}",,"Empirical strategies have been extensively studied in Software Engineering (SE) research, with a focus on understanding the types of strategies used and their characteristics. A systematic mapping study in Paper 1 identified 17 empirical strategies and 11 main characteristics from a set of studies, emphasizing the importance of selecting an appropriate strategy based on the nature and scope of the research (1). Paper 2 analyzed 369 papers in leading SE research journals, concluding that SE research is diverse regarding topic but narrow in approach and method, with a focus on technical analysis rather than behavioral aspects (2).

Empirical research in Requirements Engineering (RE) has also gained recognition since the 1990s, as shown by Paper 3. This editorial reported on the progress of empirical RE research through an analysis of systematic literature reviews and mapping studies, highlighting major areas that use methods from the Empirical Software Engineering paradigm (3).

Paper 4 conducted a systematic mapping study to identify support mechanisms used in conducting empirical studies in SE. The study identified 375 support mechanisms but noted that many studies did not cite any mechanism to guide their research, with experiment and case studies being the most applied strategies (4). Lastly, Paper 5 analyzed research published between 1997 and 2003 in the Journal of Empirical Software Engineering, revealing a focus on measurement/metrics, formulation, hypothesis testing, and laboratory experiments, but a lack of attention to people and other disciplines (5).

In summary, empirical strategies have been extensively studied in SE research, with a focus on understanding their types and characteristics. While there has been progress in empirical RE research, more attention is needed to support empirical studies through the use of appropriate mechanisms. The findings from these studies highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate strategy based on the nature and scope of the research and the resources available for its implementation.

We found that the research was somewhat narrow in topic with about half the papers focusing on measurement/metrics, review and inspection; that researchers were almost as interested in formulating as in evaluating; that hypothesis testing and laboratory experiments dominated evaluations; that research was not very likely to focus on people and extremely unlikely to refer to other disciplines. We discuss our findings in the context of making empirical software engineering more relevant to practitioners.",10.1145/1082983.1083176,Empirical research methodologies and studies in Requirements Engineering: How far did we come?,"Since the inception of the RE conference series (1992), both researchers and practitioners in the RE com-munity have acknowledged the significance of empirical evaluation as an instrument to gain knowledgeabout various aspects of RE phenomena and the validity of our research results. A significant number ofempirical studies have been conducted in the search for knowledge about RE problems as well as evidenceof successful and less successful application of proposed solutions. This editorial presents the progressempirical RE research has made since 1992. Based on a search in the Scopus digital library, we reportfrom an analysis of peer-reviewed systematic literature reviews and mapping studies to showcase majorareas of RE research that use methods from the Empirical Software Engineering paradigm.

However such critiques are typically not empirically evaluated. This paper fills this gap by empirically analyzing papers published by ICSE, the prime research conference on Software Engineering. We present quantitative and qualitative results of a quasi-random experiment of empirical evaluations over the lifetime of the conference. Our quantitative results show the quantity of empirical evaluation has increased over 29 ICSE proceedings but we still have room to improve the soundness of empirical evaluations in ICSE proceedings.

Objective: Establishing an overview of the topic through a classification scheme of publications and structure the field of interest. Method: We conducted a Systematic Mapping Study, including articles published until 2019, that report at least one study of empirical strategies in SE. Results: 80 initial sets of studies were selected and analyzed, identifying: i) empirical strategy type used and ii) Software Engineering hypotheses types used. Also, 20 papers of the set of studies for mapping were selected and analyzed, identifying 17 empirical strategies and 11 main characteristics to address the empirical research inception in SE. Conclusions: We corroborate that the selection of an empirical strategy in Software Engineering research depends on the nature and scope of the research and on the resources that the researcher has at that moment, in addition to the degree of scientific and methodological knowledge that he has to carry out an empirical study. It is necessary to continue studying in-depth the behavior and nature of the empirical strategies in Software Engineering research that allows strengthening the scientific taxonomy in SE, besides walking towards the automation of the experimental process.",10.1109/ICI2ST51859.2021.00025,Has twenty-five years of empirical software engineering made a difference?,"Our activities in software engineering typically fall into one of three categories, (1) to invent new phenomena, (2) to understand existing phenomena, and (3) to facilitate inspirational education.

In this exploration evidence is drawn from the empirical literature in the areas of software inspections and software cost modelling and estimation.

A review of literature published in the Journal of Empirical Software Engineering between 1997 and 2003 reveals a concentration on measurement/metrics, review, and inspection, with a strong inclination towards hypothesis testing and laboratory experiments, though it suggests a need for broader topics and interdisciplinary approaches (1). Similarly, an analysis of empirical studies in Requirements Engineering (RE) since 1992 indicates a significant number of empirical evaluations, highlighting the progress and areas of focus within the RE community, yet it calls for a reflection on the effectiveness of these methodologies (2). An empirical analysis of the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) proceedings over 29 years shows an increase in empirical evaluations but also points out the necessity for improving the quality and soundness of these studies (3). A systematic mapping study up to 2019 categorizes empirical strategies in software engineering research, emphasizing that the choice of methodology depends on the research's nature, scope, and available resources, and underscores the importance of advancing the scientific taxonomy and possibly automating the experimental process (4). Finally, an examination of the empirical literature in software inspections and cost modeling, compared with the Journal of Empirical Software Engineering, sheds light on the evolution of theory derivation, experimental methods, and analysis, suggesting that empirical software engineering is still maturing and facing challenges as it seeks to make a significant impact (5).","{

}",,"Empirical research has been a significant focus in both software engineering (SE) and Requirements Engineering (RE) communities since the late 1990s. Studies in various SE journals and conferences, such as Empirical Software Engineering and ICSE, have shown an increasing trend towards empirical evaluations (1, 3). These investigations primarily focus on measurement/metrics, review and inspection, hypothesis testing, and laboratory experiments (1). However, there is a need to expand the scope of research beyond these areas, incorporating people aspects and interdisciplinary approaches (2).

Empirical research in RE has made substantial progress since its inception in 1992, with numerous studies conducted to gain insights into various RE phenomena and validate proposed solutions (2). Systematic literature reviews and mapping studies have identified major areas of RE research utilizing empirical methods (2). In SE, researchers have acknowledged the importance of rigor and scientific validity in their work, leading to a growing interest in empirical strategies (4).

Despite the increasing emphasis on empirical research, critiques regarding its quantity and quality persist (3). To address these concerns, studies have analyzed the ICSE conference proceedings, revealing room for improvement in the soundness of empirical evaluations (3). Furthermore, a literature survey identified 17 empirical strategies and 11 main characteristics used in SE research (4).

In summary, empirical research has been an essential aspect of software engineering and RE research since the late 1990s. While there have been advancements in this area, there is still a need to expand the scope of research beyond measurement/metrics, review and inspection, and laboratory experiments. Improving the soundness of empirical evaluations and continuing to study the behavior and nature of empirical strategies will contribute to strengthening the scientific taxonomy in SE and RE.

An analysis of ICSE proceedings from 1993 to 2018 revealed an increase in the number of empirical evaluations but a need for improvement in their soundness (3).

A literature survey identified 17 empirical strategies and 11 main characteristics used in software engineering research, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate empirical strategies based on the nature and scope of the research (4).

Twenty-five years of empirical software engineering have made a difference in understanding existing phenomena, such as software inspections and cost modeling and estimation. However, challenges remain in theory derivation, experimental methods, and analysis as the field continues to evolve (5). Overall, empirical research has contributed significantly to advancing our knowledge in software engineering through rigorous evaluation of hypotheses and methodologies. (1-5)","{

Objectives
To enhance reproducible research by creating a broadly accessible, free, open-source software tool for connecting Microsoft Word to statistical programs (R/R Markdown, Python, SAS, Stata) so that results may be automatically updated in a manuscript.


Materials and Methods
We developed StatTag for Windows as a Microsoft Word plug-in using C# and for macOS as a native application using Objective-C. Source code is available under the MIT license at https://github.com/stattag.


Results
StatTag links analysis file(s) (R/R Markdown, SAS, Stata, or Python) and a Word document, invokes the statistical program(s) to obtain results, and embeds selected output in the document. StatTag can accommodate multiple statistical programs with a single document and features an interface to view, edit, and rerun statistical code directly from Word.


Discussion and Conclusion
StatTag may facilitate reproducibility within increasingly multidisciplinary research teams, improve research transparency through review and publication, and complement data-sharing initiatives.",,An Invitation to Teaching Reproducible Research: Lessons from a Symposium,"ABSTRACT This article synthesizes ideas that emerged over the course of a 10-week symposium titled “Teaching Reproducible Research: Educational Outcomes” https://www.projecttier.org/fellowships-and-workshops/2021-spring-symposium that took place in the spring of 2021. The speakers included one linguist, three political scientists, seven psychologists, and three statisticians; about half of them were based in the United States and about half in the United Kingdom. The symposium focused on a particular form of reproducibility—namely computational reproducibility—and the paper begins with an exposition of what computational reproducibility is and how it can be achieved. Drawing on talks by the speakers and comments from participants, the paper then enumerates several reasons for which learning reproducible research methods enhance the education of college and university students; the benefits have partly to do with developing computational skills that prepare students for future education and employment, but they also have to do with their intellectual development more broadly. The article also distills insights from the symposium about practical strategies instructors can adopt to integrate reproducibility into their teaching, as well as to promote the practice among colleagues and throughout departmental curricula. The conceptual framework about the meaning and purposes of teaching reproducibility, and the practical guidance about how to get started, add up to an invitation to instructors to explore the potential for introducing reproducibility in their classes and research supervision.",,Using Jupyter for Reproducible Scientific Workflows,"Literate computing has emerged as an important tool for computational studies and open science, with growing folklore of best practices. In this work, we report two case studies—one in computational magnetism and another in computational mathematics—where domain-specific software was exposed to the Jupyter environment. This enables high level control of simulations and computation, interactive exploration of computational results, batch processing on HPC resources, and reproducible workflow documentation in Jupyter notebooks. In the first study, Ubermag drives existing computational micromagnetics software through a domain-specific language embedded in Python. In the second study, a dedicated Jupyter kernel interfaces with the GAP system for computational discrete algebra and its dedicated programming language. In light of these case studies, we discuss the benefits of this approach, including progress toward more reproducible and reusable research results and outputs, notably through the use of infrastructure such as JupyterHub and Binder.",10.1109/MCSE.2021.3052101,"Binder 2.0 - Reproducible, interactive, sharable environments for science at scale","Binder is an open source web service that lets users create sharable, interactive, reproducible environments in the cloud. It is powered by other core projects in the open source ecosystem, including JupyterHub and Kubernetes for managing cloud resources. Binder works with pre-existing workflows in the analytics community, aiming to create interactive versions of repositories that exist on sites like GitHub with minimal extra effort needed. This paper details several of the design decisions and goals that went into the development of the current generation of Binder.",10.25080/MAJORA-4AF1F417-011,"In addressing computational reproducibility, diverse methodologies have been employed to bridge the gap between data analysis, result sharing, and manuscript preparation. The Open Science Framework (OSF) provides a comprehensive research workflow web application that supports the entire research lifecycle, promoting transparency and reproducibility across disciplines (1). Complementing this, StatTag offers a pragmatic solution by directly connecting statistical software to Microsoft Word, enabling automatic updates of results in manuscripts and supporting multiple statistical programs, thereby facilitating reproducibility within multidisciplinary teams (2). Educational strategies also play a crucial role, as highlighted by a symposium that synthesized practical strategies for integrating reproducibility into teaching, emphasizing the development of computational skills and intellectual growth among students (3). Furthermore, the incorporation of literate computing through Jupyter notebooks in domain-specific research enables interactive exploration and reproducible documentation of computational results, with case studies demonstrating its effectiveness in scientific workflows (4). Lastly, Binder 2.0 extends the reproducibility framework by creating interactive, shareable cloud-based environments that integrate with existing workflows and repositories, reducing the effort required to produce reproducible research outputs (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore a multi-faceted approach to computational reproducibility, combining tools, educational practices, and cloud-based services to enhance the reliability and transparency of scientific research.","{

1097,Climate,Oceanography and Atmospheric Sciences and Meteorology,Global Mean Sea Level Rise Projections,Evolving Understanding of Antarctic Ice‐Sheet Physics and Ambiguity in Probabilistic Sea‐Level Projections,"Mechanisms such as ice‐shelf hydrofracturing and ice‐cliff collapse may rapidly increase discharge from marine‐based ice sheets. Here, we link a probabilistic framework for sea‐level projections to a small ensemble of Antarctic ice‐sheet (AIS) simulations incorporating these physical processes to explore their influence on global‐mean sea‐level (GMSL) and relative sea‐level (RSL). We compare the new projections to past results using expert assessment and structured expert elicitation about AIS changes. Under high greenhouse gas emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP] 8.5), median projected 21st century GMSL rise increases from 79 to 146 cm. Without protective measures, revised median RSL projections would by 2100 submerge land currently home to 153 million people, an increase of 44 million. The use of a physical model, rather than simple parameterizations assuming constant acceleration of ice loss, increases forcing sensitivity: overlap between the central 90% of simulations for 2100 for RCP 8.5 (93–243 cm) and RCP 2.6 (26–98 cm) is minimal. By 2300, the gap between median GMSL estimates for RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6 reaches >10 m, with median RSL projections for RCP 8.5 jeopardizing land now occupied by 950 million people (versus 167 million for RCP 2.6). The minimal correlation between the contribution of AIS to GMSL by 2050 and that in 2100 and beyond implies current sea‐level observations cannot exclude future extreme outcomes. The sensitivity of post‐2050 projections to deeply uncertain physics highlights the need for robust decision and adaptive management frameworks.",10.1002/2017ef000663,Uncertainty in Sea Level Rise Projections Due to the Dependence Between Contributors,"Sea level rises at an accelerating pace threatening coastal communities all over the world. In this context sea level projections are key tools to help risk mitigation and adaptation. Projections are often made using models of the main contributors to sea level rise (e.g., thermal expansion, glaciers, and ice sheets). To obtain the total sea level these contributions are added; therefore, the uncertainty of total sea level depends on the correlation between the uncertainties of the contributors. This fact is important to understand the differences in the uncertainty of sea level projections from different methods. Using two process‐based models to project sea level for the 21st century, we show how to model the correlation structure and its time dependence. In these models the correlation primarily arises from uncertainty of future global mean surface temperature that correlates with almost all contributors. Assuming that sea level contributors are independent of each other, an assumption made in many sea level projections underestimates the uncertainty in sea level projections. As a result, high‐end low probability events that are important for decision making are underestimated. The uncertainty in the strength of the dependence between contributors is also explored. New dependence relations between the uncertainty of dynamical processes and surface mass balance in glaciers and ice sheets are introduced in our model. Total sea level uncertainty is found to be as sensitive to the dependence between contributors as to uncertainty in certain individual contributors like thermal expansion and Greenland ice sheet.",10.1029/2018ef000849,A probabilistic approach to 21st century regional sea-level projections using RCP and High-end scenarios,"Sea-level change is an integrated climate system response due to changes in radiative forcing, anthropogenic land-water use and land-motion. Projecting sea-level at a global and regional scale requires a subset of projections - one for each sea-level component given a particular climate-change scenario. We construct relative sealevel projections through the 21st century for RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5 and High-end (RCP 8.5 with increased ice-sheet contribution) scenarios by aggregating spatial projections of individual sea-level components in a probabilistic manner. Most of the global oceans adhere to the projected global average sea level change within 5 cm throughout the century for all scenarios; however coastal regions experience localised effects due to the non-uniform spatial patterns of individual components. This can result in local projections that are 10′s of centimetres different from the global average by 2100. Early in the century, RSL projections are consistent across all scenarios, however from the middle of the century the patterns of RSL for RCP scenarios deviate from the High-end where the contribution from Antarctica dominates. Similarly, the uncertainty in projected sea-level is dominated by an uncertain Antarctic fate. We also explore the effect upon projections of, treating CMIP5 model ensembles as normally distributed when they might not be, correcting CMIP5 model output for internal variability using different polynomials and using different unloading patterns of ice for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets",10.1016/j.gloplacha.2016.10.006,Sea level rise projections for northern Europe under RCP8.5,"Sea level rise poses a significant threat to coastal communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Sea level rise is not uniform globally but is affected by a range of regional factors. In this study, we calculate regional projections of 21st century sea level rise in northern Europe, focusing on the British Isles, the Baltic Sea, and the North Sea. The input to the regional sea level projection is a probabilistic projection of the major components of the global sea level budget. Local sea level rise is partly compensated by vertical land movement from glacial isostatic adjustment. We explore the uncertainties beyond the likely range provided by the IPCC, including the risk and potential rate of marine ice sheet collapse. Our median 21st century relative sea level rise projection is 0.8 m near London and Hamburg, with a relative sea level drop of 0.1 m in the Bay of Bothnia (near Oulu, Finland). Considerable uncertainties remain in both the sea level budget and in the regional expression of sea level rise. The greatest uncertainties are associated with Antarctic ice loss, and uncertainties are skewed towards higher values, with the 95th percentile being characterized by an additional 0.9 m sea level rise above median projections.",10.3354/cr01309,Sea-level projections representing the deeply uncertain contribution of the West Antarctic ice sheet,"AbstractThere is a growing awareness that uncertainties surrounding future sea-level projections may be much larger than typically perceived. Recently published projections appear widely divergent and highly sensitive to non-trivial model choices. Moreover, the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) may be much less stable than previous believed, enabling a rapid disintegration. Here, we present a set of probabilistic sea-level projections that approximates the deeply uncertain WAIS contributions. The projections aim to inform robust decisions by clarifying the sensitivity to non-trivial or controversial assumptions. We show that the deeply uncertain WAIS contribution can dominate other uncertainties within decades. These deep uncertainties call for the development of robust adaptive strategies. These decision-making needs, in turn, require mission-oriented basic science, for example about potential signposts and the maximum rate of WAIS-induced sea-level changes.",10.1038/s41598-017-04134-5,"The methodologies employed in the recent research on global mean sea level (GMSL) rise projections underscore the complexity and uncertainty inherent in predicting future sea levels. Paper 1 introduces a probabilistic framework linked to Antarctic ice-sheet simulations that incorporate physical processes like ice-shelf hydrofracturing and ice-cliff collapse, revealing a significant increase in median projected GMSL rise under high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. This approach emphasizes the sensitivity of projections to uncertain ice-sheet physics, advocating for robust decision-making frameworks (1). Paper 2 extends the analysis of uncertainty by modeling the correlation structure between different contributors to sea level rise, such as thermal expansion and ice sheets, demonstrating that neglecting the dependence between these contributors underestimates the uncertainty and the potential for high-end, low-probability events (2). Paper 3 employs a probabilistic approach that aggregates spatial projections of individual sea-level components, highlighting the dominance of Antarctic contributions to uncertainty and the localized effects of non-uniform spatial patterns (3). In Paper 4, the focus shifts to regional projections for northern Europe, incorporating factors like glacial isostatic adjustment and exploring uncertainties beyond the IPCC's likely range, particularly those associated with Antarctic ice loss (4). Lastly, Paper 5 presents probabilistic projections that account for the deeply uncertain contributions of the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS), emphasizing the need for robust adaptive strategies and mission-oriented basic science to inform decision-making under deep uncertainty (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of considering the interdependencies of sea level contributors, regional variations, and the profound uncertainties, particularly those related to ice sheet dynamics, in developing reliable GMSL rise projections.","{

}","Recent studies underscore the profound impact of Antarctic ice dynamics on global mean sea level (GMSL) rise projections, revealing a stark contrast between high and low greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. The inclusion of ice-shelf hydrofracturing and ice-cliff collapse mechanisms suggests that median GMSL could rise by 146 cm under high emissions by 2100, potentially inundating land currently occupied by millions (1). The uncertainty in these projections is exacerbated by the interdependence of contributing factors such as thermal expansion and ice sheet dynamics, which are often underestimated in models that assume independence, thus failing to capture the full spectrum of high-end, low-probability events (2). Regional projections further complicate the picture, as local factors can cause sea levels to deviate significantly from the global average, with the fate of the Antarctic ice sheet being a dominant source of uncertainty (3). This is particularly true for northern Europe, where projections are heavily influenced by vertical land movements and skewed uncertainties towards higher sea level rises (4). The West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) introduces deep uncertainties, dominating other factors within decades and necessitating robust adaptive strategies to cope with potential rapid disintegration (5). Collectively, these findings highlight the need for robust decision-making frameworks that can accommodate the deeply uncertain physics of ice sheet contributions to future sea level rise (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).","{

These papers employ probabilistic frameworks to explore various contributors to sea level change, including thermal expansion, glaciers, ice sheets, and their interdependencies (1, 2).

One study focuses on Antarctic ice sheet dynamics and its influence on global mean sea level projections under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) (3). It aggregates spatial projections of individual components in a probabilistic manner, revealing significant regional differences and uncertainties.

Another study calculates regional projections of 21st century sea level rise for northern Europe, considering the input from major global sea level budget components and local factors like vertical land movement (4). It explores uncertainties beyond the likely range provided by the IPCC, including potential marine ice sheet collapse.

A third study presents probabilistic projections of 21st century regional sea-level changes for RCP scenarios, emphasizing the dominant role of Antarctic ice loss in driving uncertainty (3). It also explores the impact of model choices and internal variability on projected sea level rise.

The fifth study focuses on the deeply uncertain contribution of the West Antarctic ice sheet to future sea level projections (5). It presents probabilistic projections that clarify the sensitivity to non-trivial assumptions, revealing that the WAIS contribution can dominate other uncertainties within decades and calling for the development of robust adaptive strategies.

}",,"The research on Global Mean Sea Level Rise Projections highlights the complexities and uncertainties surrounding future sea level rise due to various contributing factors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Thermal expansion, glaciers, ice sheets, and other components interact in intricate ways, leading to accelerating rates of sea level rise that pose significant risks to coastal communities and infrastructure (1, 2, 3, 4).

One critical uncertainty lies in the behavior of ice sheets, particularly the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), which may be less stable than previously believed (5). This instability could result in a rapid disintegration, leading to substantial sea level rise that dominates other uncertainties within decades (5).

Moreover, regional factors further complicate global sea level projections. For instance, northern Europe experiences varying rates of sea level rise due to localized effects and vertical land movement from glacial isostatic adjustment (4).

To address these complexities and uncertainties, researchers employ probabilistic approaches that consider the full range of possible outcomes and their associated probabilities (1, 3, 5). This approach informs robust decision-making by clarifying the sensitivity to non-trivial or controversial assumptions (5).

However, deep uncertainties surrounding WAIS contributions call for the development of adaptive strategies that can respond to various potential sea level rise scenarios (5). Mission-oriented basic science is essential to understand potential signposts and the maximum rate of WAIS-induced sea-level changes (5).

In summary, the research on Global Mean Sea Level Rise Projections underscores the need for a comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between various contributing factors and regional differences. Probabilistic approaches that consider deep uncertainties are crucial to inform robust decision-making and develop adaptive strategies in response to potential sea level rise scenarios.","{

}",,"This synthesis explores five recent studies advancing the development of high-performance Indium-Gallium-Zinc-Oxide (IGZO) Thin-Film Transistors (TFTs) for flexible electronics applications (1-5). The first paper reports a flexible IGZO QVTFT with a 300-nm channel length, fabricated using a low-temperature process and exhibiting an ON/OFF current ratio of 104, a threshold voltage of 1.5 V, and a maximum transconductance of 0.73 μS μm-1 (1). The second study focuses on flexible IGZO TFTs with AC performance exceeding 300 MHz maximum oscillation frequency (${f}_{\textsf {max}}$) (2). These devices, fabricated using self-alignment and optimized layout designs, demonstrate ${f}_{\textsf {max}}$ values of 304 ± 12 MHz and 398 ± 53 MHz, respectively, while maintaining performance under mechanical strain.

The third study introduces flexible IGZO TFTs with a channel length of 0.5 μm and reduced parasitic capacities using two-photon direct laser writing (DLW) photolithography (3). These devices exhibit a transit frequency of 135 MHz when operated at 2 V, making them suitable for flexible RFID tags and AM radios. The fourth paper presents the fabrication and characterization of IGZO TFTs with channel lengths down to 280 nm using a novel manufacturing process combining DLW photolithography and e-beam evaporation (4). These devices yield a transit frequency of 80 MHz at 8.5-V gate–source voltage, and remain functional under 0.4% tensile strain when wrapped around a cylindrical rod.

Lastly, the fifth study introduces flexible double-gate IGZO TFTs fabricated on free standing plastic foil using self-alignment (5). These devices exhibit increased transconductance and subthreshold swing compared to bottom-gate reference TFTs, with parasitic overlap capacitances as low as 5.5 fF μm-1, resulting in a transit frequency of 5.6 MHz on 7.5 μm long transistors. The flexible devices remain operational when bent to a tensile radius of 6 mm. These studies collectively demonstrate significant progress towards the development of high-performance IGZO TFTs for flexible electronics applications.","{

The transient capacitance response of the RF MEMS switches at different switch states was measured for different humidity levels. By using the C -V model as well as the voltage shift dependent of trapped charges, the transient trapped charges at different switch states and humidity levels are obtained. Charging models at different switch states are explored in detail. It is shown that the injected charges increase linearly with humidity levels and the internal polarization increases with increasing humidity at downstate. The speed of charge injection at 80% relative humidity (RH) is about ten times faster than that at 20% RH. A measurement of pull-in voltage shifts by C- V sweep cycles at 20% and 80 % RH gives a reasonable evidence. The present model is useful to understand the pull-in voltage shift of the RF MEMS switch.",10.1109/jmems.2012.2237384,RF MEMS Switches With Enhanced Power-Handling Capabilities,"This paper reports on the experimental and theoretical characterization of RF microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) switches for high-power applications. First, we investigate the problem of self-actuation due to high RF power and we demonstrate switches that do not self-actuate or catastrophically fail with a measured RF power of up to 5.5 W. Second, the problem of switch stiction to the down state as a function of the applied RF power is also theoretically and experimentally studied. Finally, a novel switch design with a top electrode is introduced and its advantages related to RF power-handling capabilities are presented. By applying this technology, we demonstrate hot-switching measurements with a maximum power of 0.8 W. Our results, backed by theory and measurements, illustrate that careful design can significantly improve the power-handling capabilities of RF MEMS switches.",10.1109/tmtt.2003.821234,Effects of surface roughness on electromagnetic characteristics of capacitive switches,"This paper studies the effect of surface roughness on up-state and down-state capacitances of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) capacitive switches. When the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness is 10 nm, the up-state capacitance is approximately 9% higher than the theoretical value. When the metal bridge is driven down, the normalized contact area between the metal bridge and the surface of the dielectric layer is less than 1% if the RMS roughness is larger than 2 nm. Therefore, the down-state capacitance is actually determined by the non-contact part of the metal bridge. The normalized isolation is only 62% for RMS roughness of 10 nm when the hold-down voltage is 30 V. The analysis also shows that the down-state capacitance and the isolation increase with the hold-down voltage. The normalized isolation increases from 58% to 65% when the hold-down voltage increases from 10 V to 60 V for RMS roughness of 10 nm.",10.1088/0960-1317/16/10/032,A zipper RF MEMS tunable capacitor with interdigitated RF and actuation electrodes,"This paper presents a new RF MEMS tunable capacitor based on the zipper principle and with interdigitated RF and actuation electrodes. The electrode configuration prevents dielectric charging under high actuation voltages. It also increases the capacitance ratio and the tunable analog range. The effect of the residual stress on the capacitance tunability is also investigated. Two devices with different interdigital RF and actuation electrodes are fabricated on an alumina substrate and result in a capacitance ratio around 3.0 (Cmin = 70–90 fF, Cmax = 240–270 fF) and with a Q > 100 at 3 GHz.

The loss in the up-state position is equivalent to the coplanar waveguide line loss and is 0.01-0.02 dB at 10-30 GHz for a 2-/spl mu/m-thick Au MEMS shunt switch. It is seen that the capacitance, inductance, and series resistance can be accurately extracted from DC-40 GHz S-parameter measurements. It is also shown that dramatic increase in the down-state isolation (20/sup +/ dB) can be achieved with the choice of the correct LC series resonant frequency of the switch.

}",,"RF microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) switches have been the subject of extensive research due to their potential applications in various fields. In the first paper, the authors developed a capacitance-voltage (C-V) model for RF MEMS switches at upstate and downstate, revealing that charging models vary between switch states and humidity levels, with injected charges increasing linearly with humidity and internal polarization increasing with humidity at downstate (1). The second study focused on enhancing power-handling capabilities of RF MEMS switches by investigating self-actuation issues under high RF power and introducing a novel switch design to improve RF power handling (2).

The third paper explored the impact of surface roughness on up-state and down-state capacitances, revealing that up-state capacitance is higher than theoretical values for RMS roughness below 10 nm but significantly less when RMS roughness exceeds 2 nm. Down-state capacitance is determined by the non-contact part of the metal bridge, and isolation decreases with increasing hold-down voltage (3).

The fourth paper presented a new RF MEMS tunable capacitor design based on the zipper principle, featuring interdigitated RF and actuation electrodes to prevent dielectric charging and increase capacitance ratio and tunable analog range (4). Lastly, the fifth study developed an electromagnetic model for membrane MEMS shunt switches, accurately modeling up-state capacitance using static solvers and predicting current distribution and inductance using full-wave solvers. The authors demonstrated that dramatic increases in down-state isolation can be achieved by selecting the correct LC series resonant frequency of the switch (5).

These studies collectively contribute to a deeper understanding of RF MEMS switches, addressing issues related to humidity effects, power handling capabilities, surface roughness, and tunability.","{

1112,Engineering,Engineering,Thermal accelerometers performance enhancements ,A Microinjected 3-Axis Thermal Accelerometer,"A completely new approach for the fabrication of 3-axis thermal accelerometers is presented in this paper. Micromolded polystyrene micro-parts are assembled with polyimide membranes enabling the construction of thermal accelerometers. The use of polymers (polystyrene and polyimide) with low thermal conductivities improves the overall power consumption of the thermal accelerometer and enables a simple and low-cost fabrication process (no clean room infrastructure required). The accelerometer is composed of 4 polystyrene microinjected structural microparts (two identical top parts and two identical central parts) and three polyimide membranes (two identical z-axis membranes and a central membrane). The microinjected parts provide the mechanical support for the active elements that are placed on the membranes (the heater and the temperature sensors). Coupled 3D thermo-electric-fluidic FEM
simulations show that current design has a sensitivity of 1.6ºC/g in the X-Y directions and 0.2ºC/g in the Z direction for a central heater temperature of 300ºC.Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT",10.1016/j.proeng.2011.12.151,A Reliable Liquid-Based CMOS MEMS Micro Thermal Convective Accelerometer With Enhanced Sensitivity and Limit of Detection,"In this paper, a liquid-based micro thermal convective accelerometer (MTCA) is optimized by the Rayleigh number (Ra) based compact model and fabricated using the  $0.35\mu $  m CMOS MEMS technology. To achieve water-proof performance, the conformal Parylene C coating was adopted as the isolation layer with the accelerated life-testing results of a 9-year-lifetime for liquid-based MTCA. Then, the device performance was characterized considering sensitivity, response time, and noise. Both the theoretical and experimental results demonstrated that fluid with a larger Ra number can provide better performance for the MTCA. More significantly, Ra based model showed its advantage to make a more accurate prediction than the simple linear model to select suitable fluid to enhance the sensitivity and balance the linear range of the device. Accordingly, an alcohol-based MTCA was achieved with a two-order-of magnitude increase in sensitivity (43.8 mV/g) and one-order-of-magnitude decrease in the limit of detection (LOD) ( $61.9~\mu \text{g}$ ) compared with the air-based MTCA. [2021-0092]",10.1109/jmems.2021.3087617,A 2-DOF convective micro accelerometer with a low thermal stress sensing element,"This paper presents the development of a dual-axis convective microaccelerometer, whose working principle is based on the convective heat transfer and thermoresistive effect of lightly doped silicon. In contrast to the developed convective accelerometer, the sensor utilizes new structures of the sensing element which can reduce at least 90% of the thermally induced stress. By using a numerical method, the dimensions of the sensing chip and of the package are optimized. The sensitivity of the sensor is simulated; other characteristics such as frequency response, shock resistance and the noise problem were investigated. The sensor has been fabricated by a microelectrical mechanical systems (MEMS) process and characterized by experiments.",10.1088/0964-1726/16/6/034,Development of a dual-axis micromachined convective accelerometer with an effective heater geometry,"This paper describes the design, fabrication and testing of a dual-axis micromachined convective accelerometer with a diamond-shaped heater. Modification of heater geometry is advantageous because it is simple and ensures enhanced sensitivity without constraining device size or operating power. The diamond-shaped heater induces active heat flow and a sharp temperature gradient around the heatertogether these effects provide high sensitivity. When the fabricated convective accelerometer used SF(6) as an enclosed gas medium, its measured sensitivity was 3.5 mV/g when operating power was 7.4 mW and its bandwidth at -3 dB was 25 Hz.

Systematical design analysis was conducted on the sensor performance covering the sensor output, sensitivity, and power consumption. The sensor output was further normalized as a function of normalized input acceleration in terms of Rayleigh number R $_{\mathrm {a}}$  (the product of Grashof number G $_{\mathrm {r}}$  and Prandtl number P $_{\mathrm {r}}$ ) for different fluids. A critical Rayleigh number (Rac = 3,000) is founded, for the first time, to determine the boundary between the linear and nonlinear response regime of MTCA. Based on the proposed 1D model, key parameters, including the location of the detectors, sensor length, thin film thickness, cavity height, heater temperature, and fluid types, were optimized to improve sensor performance. Accordingly, a CMOS compatible MTCA was designed and fabricated based on the theoretical analysis, which showed a high sensitivity of 1,289 mV/g. Therefore, this efficient 1D model, one million times faster than CFD simulation, can be a promising tool for the system-level CMOS MEMS design.",10.1109/jmems.2019.2930065,"Recent advancements in thermal accelerometer technology have focused on innovative methodologies to enhance performance through various fabrication and design strategies. The use of micromolded polystyrene and polyimide membranes in a 3-axis thermal accelerometer has demonstrated a reduction in thermal conductivity, thereby improving power consumption and simplifying the fabrication process without the need for a clean room (1). In contrast, a liquid-based micro thermal convective accelerometer (MTCA) optimized by a Rayleigh number-based compact model and fabricated using CMOS MEMS technology, employed a Parylene C coating for waterproofing and utilized fluids with higher Ra numbers to significantly increase sensitivity and reduce the limit of detection (2). A dual-axis convective microaccelerometer introduced a new sensing element structure to minimize thermally induced stress, with the dimensions of the sensing chip and package optimized using numerical methods to enhance sensor characteristics such as sensitivity and frequency response (3). Another approach involved modifying the heater geometry to a diamond shape, which induced a more active heat flow and sharper temperature gradient, resulting in higher sensitivity when using SF6 as the enclosed gas medium (4). Lastly, a one-dimensional theoretical model was developed for micro thermal convective accelerometers, allowing for systematic design analysis and optimization of sensor performance parameters, leading to the fabrication of a CMOS-compatible MTCA with high sensitivity (5).

In this work, we employed a novel polyethylenimine (PEI) modified cross-stacked superaligned carbon nanotube (CSCNT) film in the inverted planar PSCs configurated FTO/NiO x/methylammonium lead tri-iodide (MAPbI3)/6, 6-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/CSCNT:PEI. By modifying CSCNT with a certain concentration of PEI (0.5 wt %), suitable energy level alignment and promoted interfacial charge transfer have been achieved, leading to a significant enhancement in the photovoltaic performance. As a result, a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼11% was obtained with a Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 18.7 mA cm-2, a FF of 0.61 as well as negligible hysteresis. Moreover, CSCNT:PEI based inverted PSCs show superior durability in comparison to the standard silver based devices, remaining over 85% of the initial PCE after 500 h aging under various conditions, including long-term air exposure, thermal, and humid treatment. This work opens up a new avenue of facile modified carbon electrodes for highly stable and hysteresis suppressed PSCs.",10.1021/acsami.8b10253,Highly Efficient and Stable Sn-Rich Perovskite Solar Cells by Introducing Bromine,"Compositional engineering of recently arising methylammonium (MA) lead (Pb) halide based perovskites is an essential approach for finding better perovskite compositions to resolve still remaining issues of toxic Pb, long-term instability, etc. In this work, we carried out crystallographic, morphological, optical, and photovoltaic characterization of compositional MASn0.6Pb0.4I3-xBrx by gradually introducing bromine (Br) into parental Pb-Sn binary perovskite (MASn0.6Pb0.4I3) to elucidate its function in Sn-rich (Sn:Pb = 6:4) perovskites. We found significant advances in crystallinity and dense coverage of the perovskite films by inserting the Br into Sn-rich perovskite lattice. Furthermore, light-intensity-dependent open circuit voltage (Voc) measurement revealed much suppressed trap-assisted recombination for a proper Br-added (x = 0.4) device. These contributed to attaining the unprecedented power conversion efficiency of 12.1% and Voc of 0.78 V, which are, to the best of our knowledge, the highest performance in the Sn-rich (≥60%) perovskite solar cells reported so far. In addition, impressive enhancement of photocurrent-output stability and little hysteresis were found, which paves the way for the development of environmentally benign (Pb reduction), stable monolithic tandem cells using the developed low band gap (1.24-1.26 eV) MASn0.6Pb0.4I3-xBrx with suggested composition (x = 0.2-0.4).",10.1021/acsami.7b04011,Hybrid Perovskite Films by a New Variant of Pulsed Excimer Laser Deposition: A Room-Temperature Dry Process,"A new variant of the classic pulsed laser deposition (PLD) process is introduced as a room-temperature dry process for the growth and stoichiometry control of hybrid perovskite films through the use of nonstoichiometric single target ablation and off-axis growth. Mixed halide hybrid perovskite films nominally represented by CH3NH3PbI3–xAx (A = Cl or F) are also grown and are shown to reveal interesting trends in the optical properties and photoresponse. Growth of good quality lead-free CH3NH3SnI3 films is also demonstrated, and the corresponding optical properties are presented. Finally, perovskite solar cells fabricated at room temperature (which makes the process adaptable to flexible substrates) are shown to yield a conversion efficiency of about 7.7%.",10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b02561,Organometal Halide Perovskites as Visible-Light Sensitizers for Photovoltaic Cells,"Two organolead halide perovskite nanocrystals, CH(3)NH(3)PbBr(3) and CH(3)NH(3)PbI(3), were found to efficiently sensitize TiO(2) for visible-light conversion in photoelectrochemical cells. When self-assembled on mesoporous TiO(2) films, the nanocrystalline perovskites exhibit strong band-gap absorptions as semiconductors. The CH(3)NH(3)PbI(3)-based photocell with spectral sensitivity of up to 800 nm yielded a solar energy conversion efficiency of 3.8%. The CH(3)NH(3)PbBr(3)-based cell showed a high photovoltage of 0.96 V with an external quantum conversion efficiency of 65%.",10.1021/ja809598r,"To improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), various methodologies have been employed, focusing on the composition and interface engineering of the perovskite layer. Metal ion doping has been explored to address fundamental loss processes in the bulk of the perovskite layer and at the semiconductor interfaces, aiming to approach the theoretical limiting power conversion efficiency (PCE) (1). In another approach, the stability and efficiency of inverted PSCs were enhanced by incorporating polyethylenimine-modified carbon nanotubes as electrodes, which facilitated energy level alignment and interfacial charge transfer, leading to a notable PCE improvement and superior durability (2). Compositional engineering was also applied by introducing bromine into Sn-rich perovskite lattices, which improved crystallinity and film coverage, reduced trap-assisted recombination, and achieved high PCE with minimal hysteresis (3). A novel room-temperature dry process variant of pulsed excimer laser deposition was developed for the growth and stoichiometry control of hybrid perovskite films, enabling the fabrication of PSCs on flexible substrates (4).

Metal ion doping has been identified as a key strategy to address fundamental loss processes in the perovskite layer and at semiconductor interfaces, which are critical for achieving near-theoretical PCEs (1). Concurrently, the stability of inverted PSCs has been significantly improved by employing polyethylenimine-modified carbon nanotubes as electrodes, which facilitate energy level alignment and interfacial charge transfer, leading to higher PCEs and superior durability under adverse conditions (2). Compositional engineering, particularly the introduction of bromine into Sn-rich perovskites, has shown to enhance crystallinity, coverage, and reduce trap-assisted recombination, resulting in unprecedented PCEs and stability for Sn-rich PSCs, while also addressing environmental concerns associated with lead (3). Additionally, the development of a room-temperature dry process for the growth of hybrid perovskite films using pulsed excimer laser deposition has emerged as a promising method for producing PSCs on flexible substrates, despite currently lower PCEs (4). Finally, the use of organometal halide perovskites as visible-light sensitizers has demonstrated strong band-gap absorptions and high photovoltages, contributing to the overall improvement of PSCs (5).

}",,"Perovskite solar cells have gained significant attention due to their potential to achieve high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Paper 1 explores the role of metal ion doping in improving the fundamental loss processes within perovskite layers and interfaces, aiming for theoretical PCE limits (1). In Paper 2, researchers employed polyethylenimine-modified carbon nanotubes as electrodes in inverted perovskite solar cells to enhance photovoltaic performance and stability, achieving a champion PCE of ∼11% with negligible hysteresis (2). Paper 3 focused on compositional engineering by introducing bromine into Sn-rich perovskites, leading to enhanced crystallinity, suppressed trap-assisted recombination, and unprecedented PCEs of 12.1% and a Voc of 0.78 V (3). Paper 4 introduced a new room-temperature dry process for hybrid perovskite films using nonstoichiometric single target ablation and off-axis growth, resulting in good quality lead-free CH3NH3SnI3 films and a conversion efficiency of about 7.7% (4). Lastly, Paper 5 reported the use of organometal halide perovskites as visible-light sensitizers for photovoltaic cells, yielding solar energy conversion efficiencies up to 3.8% and high photovoltages (5). These studies collectively contribute to advancing the understanding and optimization of perovskite solar cell efficiency and stability.","{

1114,Computer Engineering,Computer Engineering,Exploring LLM-augmented KG completion methods,Sequence-to-Sequence Knowledge Graph Completion and Question Answering,"Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models represent each entity and relation of a knowledge graph (KG) with low-dimensional embedding vectors. These methods have recently been applied to KG link prediction and question answering over incomplete KGs (KGQA). KGEs typically create an embedding for each entity in the graph, which results in large model sizes on real-world graphs with millions of entities. For downstream tasks these atomic entity representations often need to be integrated into a multi stage pipeline, limiting their utility. We show that an off-the-shelf encoder-decoder Transformer model can serve as a scalable and versatile KGE model obtaining state-of-the-art results for KG link prediction and incomplete KG question answering. We achieve this by posing KG link prediction as a sequence-to-sequence task and exchange the triple scoring approach taken by prior KGE methods with autoregressive decoding. Such a simple but powerful method reduces the model size up to 98% compared to conventional KGE models while keeping inference time tractable. After finetuning this model on the task of KGQA over incomplete KGs, our approach outperforms baselines on multiple large-scale datasets without extensive hyperparameter tuning.",10.48550/arXiv.2203.10321,Joint Language Semantic and Structure Embedding for Knowledge Graph Completion,"The task of completing knowledge triplets has broad downstream applications. Both structural and semantic information plays an important role in knowledge graph completion. Unlike previous approaches that rely on either the structures or semantics of the knowledge graphs, we propose to jointly embed the semantics in the natural language description of the knowledge triplets with their structure information. Our method embeds knowledge graphs for the completion task via fine-tuning pre-trained language models with respect to a probabilistic structured loss, where the forward pass of the language models captures semantics and the loss reconstructs structures. Our extensive experiments on a variety of knowledge graph benchmarks have demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance of our method. We also show that our method can significantly improve the performance in a low-resource regime, thanks to the better use of semantics. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/pkusjh/LASS.",10.48550/arXiv.2209.08721,From Discrimination to Generation: Knowledge Graph Completion with Generative Transformer,"Knowledge graph completion aims to address the problem of extending a KG with missing triples. In this paper, we provide an approach GenKGC, which converts knowledge graph completion to sequence-to-sequence generation task with the pre-trained language model. We further introduce relation-guided demonstration and entity-aware hierarchical decoding for better representation learning and fast inference. Experimental results on three datasets show that our approach can obtain better or comparable performance than baselines and achieve faster inference speed compared with previous methods with pre-trained language models. We also release a new large-scale Chinese knowledge graph dataset OpenBG500 for research purpose1.",,SimKGC: Simple Contrastive Knowledge Graph Completion with Pre-trained Language Models,"Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to reason over known facts and infer the missing links. Text-based methods such as KGBERT (Yao et al., 2019) learn entity representations from natural language descriptions, and have the potential for inductive KGC. However, the performance of text-based methods still largely lag behind graph embedding-based methods like TransE (Bordes et al., 2013) and RotatE (Sun et al., 2019b). In this paper, we identify that the key issue is efficient contrastive learning. To improve the learning efficiency, we introduce three types of negatives: in-batch negatives, pre-batch negatives, and self-negatives which act as a simple form of hard negatives. Combined with InfoNCE loss, our proposed model SimKGC can substantially outperform embedding-based methods on several benchmark datasets. In terms of mean reciprocal rank (MRR), we advance the state-of-the-art by +19% on WN18RR, +6.8% on the Wikidata5M transductive setting, and +22% on the Wikidata5M inductive setting. Thorough analyses are conducted to gain insights into each component. Our code is available at https://github.com/intfloat/SimKGC .",10.48550/arXiv.2203.02167,Structure-Augmented Text Representation Learning for Efficient Knowledge Graph Completion,"Human-curated knowledge graphs provide critical supportive information to various natural language processing tasks, but these graphs are usually incomplete, urging auto-completion of them (a.k.a. knowledge graph completion). Prevalent graph embedding approaches, e.g., TransE, learn structured knowledge via representing graph elements (i.e., entities/relations) into dense embeddings and capturing their triple-level relationship with spatial distance. However, they are hardly generalizable to the elements never visited in training and are intrinsically vulnerable to graph incompleteness. In contrast, textual encoding approaches, e.g., KG-BERT, resort to graph triple’s text and triple-level contextualized representations. They are generalizable enough and robust to the incompleteness, especially when coupled with pre-trained encoders. But two major drawbacks limit the performance: (1) high overheads due to the costly scoring of all possible triples in inference, and (2) a lack of structured knowledge in the textual encoder. In this paper, we follow the textual encoding paradigm and aim to alleviate its drawbacks by augmenting it with graph embedding techniques – a complementary hybrid of both paradigms. Specifically, we partition each triple into two asymmetric parts as in translation-based graph embedding approach, and encode both parts into contextualized representations by a Siamese-style textual encoder. Built upon the representations, our model employs both deterministic classifier and spatial measurement for representation and structure learning respectively. It thus reduces the overheads by reusing graph elements’ embeddings to avoid combinatorial explosion, and enhances structured knowledge by exploring the spatial characteristics. Moreover, we develop a self-adaptive ensemble scheme to further improve the performance by incorporating triple scores from an existing graph embedding model. In experiments, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks and a zero-shot dataset for link prediction, with highlights of inference costs reduced by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to a sophisticated textual encoding method.",10.1145/3442381.3450043,"Recent advancements in knowledge graph completion (KGC) have leveraged the power of large language models (LLMs) and transformer architectures to enhance the prediction of missing links in knowledge graphs (KGs). The sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) approach has been pivotal, with one study demonstrating that an encoder-decoder Transformer model can effectively perform KG link prediction and question answering by framing the task as a seq2seq problem, thus significantly reducing model size and maintaining efficient inference times (1). Another methodology integrates the semantic information from natural language descriptions of KG triplets with their structural information, using pre-trained language models fine-tuned with a probabilistic structured loss, which has shown improved performance, particularly in low-resource settings (2). The GenKGC approach extends this by introducing relation-guided demonstration and entity-aware hierarchical decoding, which enhances representation learning and accelerates inference (3). Contrastive learning has also been identified as a key factor in KGC, with the SimKGC model employing various types of negatives and InfoNCE loss to outperform traditional embedding-based methods (4). Lastly, a structure-augmented text representation learning model combines the strengths of textual encoding and graph embedding techniques, using a Siamese-style textual encoder and a self-adaptive ensemble scheme to reduce inference costs and incorporate structured knowledge more effectively (5). Collectively, these methodologies contribute to the research problem by offering diverse yet complementary approaches to augmenting KG completion with LLMs, each addressing different aspects of the challenge, from model efficiency and semantic integration to contrastive learning and hybrid encoding strategies.","{

}",,"This synthesis explores five recent papers that propose innovative methods for knowledge graph (KG) completion using large language models (LLMs). The first paper (1) demonstrates the effectiveness of an encoder-decoder Transformer model as a scalable and versatile KGE model, reducing model size up to 98% while maintaining state-of-the-art results for link prediction and question answering. Paper two (2) introduces a method that jointly embeds semantics in natural language descriptions with structure information, achieving superior performance on various knowledge graph benchmarks.

The third paper (3) converts the knowledge graph completion problem to a sequence-to-sequence generation task using pre-trained language models and presents relation-guided demonstration and entity-aware hierarchical decoding for improved representation learning. Paper four (4) focuses on improving learning efficiency in text-based methods by introducing three types of negatives and InfoNCE loss, resulting in substantial performance advancements over embedding-based methods.

Lastly, paper five (5) proposes a hybrid approach that combines textual encoding with graph embedding techniques to alleviate the drawbacks of each paradigm. By augmenting textual encoders with graph embeddings and employing both deterministic classifiers and spatial measurements for representation and structure learning, this method reduces overheads and enhances structured knowledge while achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.","{

1116,Biomedical,Electrical and Computer Engineering,Representation Learning on Biomedical Data,node2vec: Scalable Feature Learning for Networks,"Prediction tasks over nodes and edges in networks require careful effort in engineering features used by learning algorithms. Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together, our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state-of-the-art task-independent representations in complex networks.",10.1145/2939672.2939754,Onto2vec: joint vector-based representation of biological entities and their ontology-based annotations,"Motivation Biological knowledge is widely represented in the form of ontology‐based annotations: ontologies describe the phenomena assumed to exist within a domain, and the annotations associate a (kind of) biological entity with a set of phenomena within the domain. The structure and information contained in ontologies and their annotations make them valuable for developing machine learning, data analysis and knowledge extraction algorithms; notably, semantic similarity is widely used to identify relations between biological entities, and ontology‐based annotations are frequently used as features in machine learning applications. Results We propose the Onto2Vec method, an approach to learn feature vectors for biological entities based on their annotations to biomedical ontologies. Our method can be applied to a wide range of bioinformatics research problems such as similarity‐based prediction of interactions between proteins, classification of interaction types using supervised learning, or clustering. To evaluate Onto2Vec, we use the gene ontology (GO) and jointly produce dense vector representations of proteins, the GO classes to which they are annotated, and the axioms in GO that constrain these classes. First, we demonstrate that Onto2Vec‐generated feature vectors can significantly improve prediction of protein‐protein interactions in human and yeast. We then illustrate how Onto2Vec representations provide the means for constructing data‐driven, trainable semantic similarity measures that can be used to identify particular relations between proteins. Finally, we use an unsupervised clustering approach to identify protein families based on their Enzyme Commission numbers. Our results demonstrate that Onto2Vec can generate high quality feature vectors from biological entities and ontologies. Onto2Vec has the potential to significantly outperform the state‐of‐the‐art in several predictive applications in which ontologies are involved. Availability and implementation https://github.com/bio‐ontology‐research‐group/onto2vec",10.1093/bioinformatics/bty259,DeepWalk: online learning of social representations,"We present DeepWalk, a novel approach for learning latent representations of vertices in a network. These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk's latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as BlogCatalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that DeepWalk outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information. DeepWalk's representations can provide F1 scores up to 10% higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments, DeepWalk's representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while using 60% less training data. DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online learning algorithm which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for a broad class of real world applications such as network classification, and anomaly detection.",10.1145/2623330.2623732,Embedding logical queries on knowledge graphs,"Learning low-dimensional embeddings of knowledge graphs is a powerful approach used to predict unobserved or missing edges between entities. However, an open challenge in this area is developing techniques that can go beyond simple edge prediction and handle more complex logical queries, which might involve multiple unobserved edges, entities, and variables. For instance, given an incomplete biological knowledge graph, we might want to predict ""em what drugs are likely to target proteins involved with both diseases X and Y?"" -- a query that requires reasoning about all possible proteins that might interact with diseases X and Y. Here we introduce a framework to efficiently make predictions about conjunctive logical queries -- a flexible but tractable subset of first-order logic -- on incomplete knowledge graphs. In our approach, we embed graph nodes in a low-dimensional space and represent logical operators as learned geometric operations (e.g., translation, rotation) in this embedding space. By performing logical operations within a low-dimensional embedding space, our approach achieves a time complexity that is linear in the number of query variables, compared to the exponential complexity required by a naive enumeration-based approach. We demonstrate the utility of this framework in two application studies on real-world datasets with millions of relations: predicting logical relationships in a network of drug-gene-disease interactions and in a graph-based representation of social interactions derived from a popular web forum.",,Universal representation learning of knowledge bases by jointly embedding instances and ontological concepts,"Many large-scale knowledge bases simultaneously represent two views of knowledge graphs (KGs): an ontology view for abstract and commonsense concepts, and an instance view for specific entities that are instantiated from ontological concepts. Existing KG embedding models, however, merely focus on representing one of the two views alone. In this paper, we propose a novel two-view KG embedding model, JOIE, with the goal to produce better knowledge embedding and enable new applications that rely on multi-view knowledge. JOIE employs both cross-view and intra-view modeling that learn on multiple facets of the knowledge base. The cross-view association model is learned to bridge the embeddings of ontological concepts and their corresponding instance-view entities. The intra-view models are trained to capture the structured knowledge of instance and ontology views in separate embedding spaces, with a hierarchy-aware encoding technique enabled for ontologies with hierarchies. We explore multiple representation techniques for the two model components and investigate with nine variants of JOIE. Our model is trained on large-scale knowledge bases that consist of massive instances and their corresponding ontological concepts connected via a (small) set of cross-view links. Experimental results on public datasets show that the best variant of JOIE significantly outperforms previous models on instance-view triple prediction task as well as ontology population on ontology-view KG. In addition, our model successfully extends the use of KG embeddings to entity typing with promising performance.",,"In the realm of biomedical data, representation learning methodologies have been developed to capture complex patterns and facilitate various predictive tasks. The node2vec framework (1) employs a flexible biased random walk procedure to learn continuous feature representations of nodes in networks, maximizing the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods. This approach generalizes prior work by allowing more diverse neighborhood exploration, which is crucial for richer representations. Onto2Vec (2) extends this concept by generating feature vectors for biological entities based on their annotations to biomedical ontologies, using the structure and information contained within these ontologies to improve prediction of protein-protein interactions and other applications. DeepWalk (3) similarly learns latent representations of vertices in social networks through truncated random walks, treating these walks as sentences in a language model to encode social relations in a vector space. This method demonstrates scalability and effectiveness in network classification tasks. In a more complex scenario, a framework for embedding logical queries on knowledge graphs (4) represents logical operators as learned geometric operations in a low-dimensional embedding space, efficiently handling conjunctive logical queries on incomplete graphs. Lastly, JOIE (5) introduces a two-view knowledge graph embedding model that jointly embeds instances and ontological concepts, employing cross-view and intra-view modeling to bridge and capture structured knowledge in separate embedding spaces. This model outperforms previous ones in tasks such as instance-view triple prediction and ontology population, showcasing the potential of multi-view knowledge representation. Collectively, these methodologies (1-5) underscore the importance of flexible, scalable, and multi-faceted approaches to representation learning in the biomedical domain.","{

1117,Computer Engineering,Computer Engineering,text classification,comet: commonsense transformers for automatic knowledge graph construction,"We present the first comprehensive study on automatic knowledge base construction for two prevalent commonsense knowledge graphs: ATOMIC (Sap et al., 2019) and ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017). Contrary to many conventional KBs that store knowledge with canonical templates, commonsense KBs only store loosely structured open-text descriptions of knowledge. We posit that an important step toward automatic commonsense completion is the development of generative models of commonsense knowledge, and propose COMmonsEnse Transformers (COMET) that learn to generate rich and diverse commonsense descriptions in natural language. Despite the challenges of commonsense modeling, our investigation reveals promising results when implicit knowledge from deep pre-trained language models is transferred to generate explicit knowledge in commonsense knowledge graphs. Empirical results demonstrate that COMET is able to generate novel knowledge that humans rate as high quality, with up to 77.5% (ATOMIC) and 91.7% (ConceptNet) precision at top 1, which approaches human performance for these resources. Our findings suggest that using generative commonsense models for automatic commonsense KB completion could soon be a plausible alternative to extractive methods.",,zero-shot word sense disambiguation using sense definition embeddings,"Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a long-standing but open problem in Natural Language Processing (NLP). WSD corpora are typically small in size, owing to an expensive annotation process. Current supervised WSD methods treat senses as discrete labels and also resort to predicting the Most-Frequent-Sense (MFS) for words unseen during training. This leads to poor performance on rare and unseen senses. To overcome this challenge, we propose Extended WSD Incorporating Sense Embeddings (EWISE), a supervised model to perform WSD by predicting over a continuous sense embedding space as opposed to a discrete label space. This allows EWISE to generalize over both seen and unseen senses, thus achieving generalized zero-shot learning. To obtain target sense embeddings, EWISE utilizes sense definitions. EWISE learns a novel sentence encoder for sense definitions by using WordNet relations and also ConvE, a recently proposed knowledge graph embedding method. We also compare EWISE against other sentence encoders pretrained on large corpora to generate definition embeddings. EWISE achieves new state-of-the-art WSD performance.",,creative storytelling with language models and knowledge graphs,"Automated story generation is a popular and well-recognized task in the field of natural language processing. The emergence of pre-trained language models based on large Transformer architectures shows the great capability of text generation. However, language models are limited when the generation requires explicit clues within the context. In this research, we study how to combine knowledge graphs with language models, and build a creative story generation system named DICE. DICE uses external knowledge graphs to provide context clues and implicit knowledge to generate coherent and creative stories. The evaluation shows that our approach can effectively inject the knowledge from knowledge graphs into the stories automatically generated by the language model.",,contextual language models for knowledge graph completion,"Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have become the backbone of various machine learning based applications over the past decade. However, the KGs are often incomplete and inconsistent. Several representation learning based approaches have been introduced to complete the missing information in KGs. Besides, Neural Language Models (NLMs) have gained huge momentum in NLP applications. However, exploiting the contextual NLMs to tackle the Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) task is still an open research problem. In this paper, a GPT-2 based KGC model is proposed and is evaluated on two benchmark datasets. The initial results obtained from the fine-tuning of the GPT-2 model for triple classification strengthens the importance of usage of NLMs for KGC. Also, the impact of contextual language models for KGC has been discussed.",,text generation from knowledge graphs with graph transformers,"Generating texts which express complex ideas spanning multiple sentences requires a structured representation of their content (document plan), but these representations are prohibitively expensive to manually produce. In this work, we address the problem of generating coherent multi-sentence texts from the output of an information extraction system, and in particular a knowledge graph. Graphical knowledge representations are ubiquitous in computing, but pose a significant challenge for text generation techniques due to their non-hierarchical nature, collapsing of long-distance dependencies, and structural variety. We introduce a novel graph transforming encoder which can leverage the relational structure of such knowledge graphs without imposing linearization or hierarchical constraints. Incorporated into an encoder-decoder setup, we provide an end-to-end trainable system for graph-to-text generation that we apply to the domain of scientific text. Automatic and human evaluations show that our technique produces more informative texts which exhibit better document structure than competitive encoder-decoder methods.",,"In addressing the challenge of text classification, recent methodologies have leveraged the power of pre-trained language models and knowledge graphs, demonstrating significant advancements in various NLP tasks.

COMET learns to generate rich and diverse commonsense descriptions in natural language, enabling the transfer of implicit knowledge from deep pre-trained language models to generate explicit knowledge in these graphs.

Another approach to text classification is zero-shot Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) using sense definition embeddings with Extended WSD Incorporating Sense Embeddings (EWISE) (2). EWISE predicts over a continuous sense embedding space instead of a discrete label space, allowing generalized zero-shot learning and improved performance on both seen and unseen senses. It utilizes sense definitions to learn novel sentence encoders for generating definition embeddings (2).

Combining language models with knowledge graphs is another text classification method, as demonstrated by the creative story generation system DICE (3). DICE uses external knowledge graphs to provide context clues and implicit knowledge for generating coherent and creative stories. The evaluation shows that this approach effectively injects knowledge from knowledge graphs into automatically generated stories (3).

Contextual language models are also being explored for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) tasks, as shown in a study using a GPT-2 based KGC model (4). This model's initial results suggest the importance of contextual language models for KGC and strengthen their usage.

Lastly, generating coherent multi-sentence texts from knowledge graphs is addressed by introducing a novel graph transforming encoder that can leverage the relational structure of these graphs without imposing linearization or hierarchical constraints (5). This technique produces more informative texts with better document structure than competitive encoder-decoder methods, as shown through automatic and human evaluations (5).

In summary, text classification research includes using generative models for commonsense knowledge graph construction, zero-shot WSD using sense definition embeddings, combining language models with knowledge graphs, contextual language models for KGC, and generating coherent multi-sentence texts from knowledge graphs.

A GPT-2 based model is proposed in (4) for Knowledge Graph Completion, strengthening the importance of contextual language models for this task. Lastly, (5) introduces a graph transforming encoder to generate coherent multi-sentence texts from knowledge graphs, providing an end-to-end trainable system for graph-to-text generation that produces more informative and structured texts than competitive methods. These studies demonstrate the potential of integrating deep learning models with knowledge graphs to tackle various text classification tasks, achieving promising results in commonsense completion, word sense disambiguation, story generation, and knowledge graph completion.

1119,Computer Engineering,Computer Engineering,Exploring Personal Knowledge Graph Literature,Personalized Knowledge Graph Summarization: From the Cloud to Your Pocket,"The increasing scale of encyclopedic knowledge graphs (KGs) calls for summarization as a way to help users efficiently access and distill world knowledge. Motivated by the disparity between individuals' limited information needs and the massive scale of KGs, in this paper we propose a new problem called personalized knowledge graph summarization. The goal is to construct compact ""personal summaries"" of KGs containing only the facts most relevant to individuals' interests. Such summaries can be stored and utilized on-device, allowing individuals private, anytime access to the information that interests them most. We formalize the problem as one of constructing a sparse graph, or summary, that maximizes a user's inferred ""utility"" over a given KG, subject to a user-and device-specific constraint on the summary's size. To solve it, we propose GLIMPSE, a summarization framework that provides theoretical guarantees on the summary's utility and is linear in the number of edges in the KG. In an evaluation with real user queries to open-source, encyclopedic KGs of up to one billion triples, we show that GLIMPSE efficiently creates summaries that outperform strong baselines by up to 19% in query answering F1 score.",10.1109/ICDM.2019.00063,Personal Knowledge Base Construction from Text-based Lifelogs,"With the passage of time, people often have misty memories of their past experiences. Information recall support for people by collecting personal lifelogs is emerging. Recently, people tend to record their daily life via filming Video Weblog (VLog), which contains visual and audio data. These large scale multimodal data can be used to support information recall service that enables users to query their past experiences. The challenging issue is the semantic gap between the visual concept and the textual query. In this paper, we aim to extract personal life events from vlogs shared on YouTube and construct a personal knowledge base (PKB) for individuals. A multitask learning model is proposed to extract the components of personal life events, such as subjects, predicates and objects. The evaluation is performed on a video collection from three YouTubers who are English native speakers. Experimental results show our model achieves promising performance.",10.1145/3460426.3463589,A Human-in-the-Loop Approach for Personal Knowledge Graph Construction from File Names,"Users’ personal and work related concepts (e.g. persons, projects, topics) are usually not sufficiently covered by knowledge graphs. Yet, already handmade classification schemes, prominently folder structures, naturally mention several of their concepts in file names. Thus, such data could be a promising source for constructing personal knowledge graphs. However, this idea poses several challenges: file names are usually noisy non-grammatical text snippets, while folder structures do not clearly define how concepts relate to each other. To cope with this semantic gap, we include knowledge workers as humans-in-the-loop to guide the building process with their feedback. Our semi-automatic personal knowledge graph construction approach consists of four major stages: domain term extraction, ontology population, taxonomic and non-taxonomic relation learning. We conduct a case study with four expert interviews from different domains in an industrial scenario. Results indicate that file systems are promising sources and, combined with our approach, already yield useful personal knowledge graphs with moderate effort spent.",,Data Augmentation for Personal Knowledge Base Population,"Cold start knowledge base population (KBP) is the problem of populating a knowledge base from unstructured documents. While artificial neural networks have led to significant improvements in the different tasks that are part of KBP, the overall F1 of the end-to-end system remains quite low. This problem is more acute in personal knowledge bases, which present additional challenges with regard to data protection, fairness and privacy. In this work, we present a system that uses rule based annotators and a graph neural network for missing link prediction, to populate a more complete, fair and diverse knowledge base from the TACRED dataset.",,Personal Knowledge Graphs: Use Cases in e-learning Platforms,"Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) are introduced by the semantic web community as small-sized user-centric knowledge graphs (KGs). PKGs fill the gap of personalised representation of user data and interests on the top of big, well-established encyclopedic KGs, such as DBpedia [21]. Inspired by the widely recent usage of PKGs in the medical domain to represent patient data, this PhD proposal aims to adopt a similar technique in the educational domain in e-learning platforms by deploying PKGs to represent users and learners. We propose a novel PKG development that relies on ontology and interlinks to Linked Open Data. Hence, adding the dimension of personalisation and explainability in users’ featured data while respecting privacy. This research design is developed in two use cases: a collaborative search learning platform and an e-learning platform. Our preliminary results show that e-learning platforms can get benefited from our approach by providing personalised recommendations and more user and group-specific data.",10.48550/arXiv.2203.08507,"In the quest to tailor knowledge graphs (KGs) to individual needs, researchers have employed various methodologies to construct and refine Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs). The GLIMPSE framework addresses personalized KG summarization by creating sparse graphs that maximize user utility, ensuring efficiency and theoretical guarantees on utility (1). In contrast, the extraction of personal life events from multimodal data like vlogs for PKB construction utilizes a multitask learning model, demonstrating the potential of leveraging rich, user-generated content (2). A human-in-the-loop approach acknowledges the complexity and noise in personal data, such as file names, by involving knowledge workers to guide the PKG construction through stages like domain term extraction and ontology population, which has shown promise in industrial scenarios (3). Data augmentation for PKB population tackles the cold start problem in KBP by combining rule-based annotators with graph neural networks to enhance completeness and diversity, addressing challenges of data protection and privacy (4). Lastly, the application of PKGs in e-learning platforms involves ontology development and interlinking with Linked Open Data, aiming to provide personalized recommendations and explainable user data while maintaining privacy, with preliminary results indicating benefits in educational settings (5). Collectively, these methodologies contribute to the research problem by exploring diverse data sources, incorporating user input, and applying machine learning techniques to create PKGs that are both personalized and privacy-conscious.","{

}","The burgeoning field of Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) addresses the challenge of tailoring vast encyclopedic knowledge to individual needs, enabling efficient access to highly relevant information (1). Personalized Knowledge Graph Summarization techniques, such as GLIMPSE, aim to distill these expansive graphs into concise, user-specific summaries that enhance utility and accessibility, demonstrating significant improvements in query answering (1). Concurrently, the construction of PKGs from text-based lifelogs, such as VLogs, leverages multimodal data to bridge the semantic gap between visual content and textual queries, facilitating the recall of personal experiences (2). This is complemented by a human-in-the-loop approach that extracts personal and work-related concepts from file names, despite the inherent noisiness and lack of grammatical structure, to construct PKGs that reflect users' real-world concepts with moderate effort (3). Moreover, the population of personal knowledge bases confronts the cold start problem and emphasizes the importance of data protection, fairness, and privacy, employing techniques like rule-based annotators and graph neural networks for link prediction (4). In the realm of e-learning, PKGs are being adapted to provide personalized recommendations and explainable user data, demonstrating their potential to enhance educational platforms through ontology-based development and interlinking with Linked Open Data (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the significance of personalization, privacy, and user engagement in the evolution of PKGs, paving the way for more intimate and user-centric knowledge management systems (1-5).","{

We use a combination of analytical and numerical methods to solve generalized inverse kinematics problems including position, orientation, and aiming constraints. Our combination of analytical and numerical methods results in faster and more reliable algorithms than conventional inverse Jacobian and optimization-based techniques. Additionally, unlike conventional numerical algorithms, our methods allow the user to interactively explore all possible solutions using an intuitive set of parameters that define the redundancy of the system.",10.1006/gmod.2000.0528,Inverse Kinematics Techniques in Computer Graphics: A Survey: Inverse Kinematics Techniques in Computer Graphics,"Inverse kinematics (IK) is the use of kinematic equations to determine the joint parameters of a manipulator so that the end effector moves to a desired position; IK can be applied in many areas, including robotics, engineering, computer graphics and video games. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of the IK problem and the solutions developed over the years from the computer graphics point of view. The paper starts with the definition of forward and IK, their mathematical formulations and explains how to distinguish the unsolvable cases, indicating when a solution is available. The IK literature in this report is divided into four main categories: the analytical, the numerical, the data‐driven and the hybrid methods. A timeline illustrating key methods is presented, explaining how the IK approaches have progressed over the years. The most popular IK methods are discussed with regard to their performance, computational cost and the smoothness of their resulting postures, while we suggest which IK family of solvers is best suited for particular problems. Finally, we indicate the limitations of the current IK methodologies and propose future research directions.",10.1111/cgf.13310,A Fast Inverse Kinematics Algorithm for Joint Animation,"AbstractThe cyclic coordinate descent(CCD) is a well-known algorithm used for inverse kinematics solutions in multi-joint chains. CCD algorithm can be easily implemented, but it can take a series of iterations before converging to a solution and also generate improper joint rotations. This paper presents a novel Target Triangle algorithm that can fast decides orientation and angle of joint rotation, and eliminates problems associated with improper and large angle rotations. Experimental results are presented to show the performance benefits of the proposed algorithm over CCD methods",10.1016/j.proeng.2011.11.2655,Style-based inverse kinematics,"This paper presents an inverse kinematics system based on a learned model of human poses. Given a set of constraints, our system can produce the most likely pose satisfying those constraints, in real-time. Training the model on different input data leads to different styles of IK. The model is represented as a probability distribution over the space of all possible poses. This means that our IK system can generate any pose, but prefers poses that are most similar to the space of poses in the training data. We represent the probability with a novel model called a Scaled Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model. The parameters of the model are all learned automatically; no manual tuning is required for the learning component of the system. We additionally describe a novel procedure for interpolating between styles.Our style-based IK can replace conventional IK, wherever it is used in computer animation and computer vision. We demonstrate our system in the context of a number of applications: interactive character posing, trajectory keyframing, real-time motion capture with missing markers, and posing from a 2D image.",10.1145/1015706.1015755,Human upper-body inverse kinematics for increased embodiment in consumer-grade virtual reality,"Having a virtual body can increase embodiment in virtual reality (VR) applications. However, comsumer-grade VR falls short of delivering sufficient sensory information for full-body motion capture. Consequently, most current VR applications do not even show arms, although they are often in the field of view. We address this shortcoming with a novel human upper-body inverse kinematics algorithm specifically targeted at tracking from head and hand sensors only. We present heuristics for elbow positioning depending on the shoulder-to-hand distance and for avoiding reaching unnatural joint limits. Our results show that our method increases the accuracy compared to general inverse kinematics applied to human arms with the same tracking input. In a user study, participants preferred our method over displaying disembodied hands without arms, but also over a more expensive motion capture system. In particular, our study shows that virtual arms animated with our inverse kinematics system can be used for applications involving heavy arm movement. We demonstrate that our method can not only be used to increase embodiment, but can also support interaction involving arms or shoulders, such as holding up a shield.",10.1145/3281505.3281529,"The methodologies employed in the realm of motion synthesis through inverse kinematics (IK) demonstrate a diverse array of approaches tailored to enhance the realism and efficiency of animated movements. The combination of analytical and numerical methods in the development of IK algorithms for anthropomorphic limbs offers a balance between speed and reliability, allowing for interactive exploration of multiple solutions (1). This is complemented by a comprehensive survey that categorizes IK techniques into analytical, numerical, data-driven, and hybrid methods, providing a historical context and suggesting suitable solvers for specific problems (2). The introduction of the Target Triangle algorithm marks a significant advancement, addressing the limitations of the cyclic coordinate descent method by rapidly determining joint orientations and angles, thereby mitigating issues of improper rotations (3). A novel approach is seen in the style-based IK system, which leverages a learned model of human poses to generate the most likely pose given a set of constraints, introducing a Scaled Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model for pose probability representation and enabling style interpolation (4). Lastly, a specialized human upper-body IK algorithm tailored for consumer-grade VR enhances embodiment by using heuristics for elbow positioning and avoiding unnatural joint limits, demonstrating superiority over general IK methods in applications with heavy arm movement (5).

IK methods can be categorized into analytical, numerical, data-driven, and hybrid approaches (2). Analytical methods use closed-form solutions, while numerical techniques employ iterative algorithms like cyclic coordinate descent (CCD) or gradient descent (1, 3). Data-driven methods rely on machine learning models to learn IK solutions from training data (4), and hybrid methods combine multiple approaches for improved performance.

The CCD algorithm is a popular inverse kinematics technique but can be slow to converge and may generate improper joint rotations (3). To address these issues, researchers have proposed the Target Triangle algorithm, which decides orientation and angle of joint rotation more quickly and eliminates problems associated with improper and large angle rotations (3).

Recent advancements in IK include style-based systems that learn human poses from training data to generate realistic and varied poses (4), and algorithms specifically targeted at tracking human upper bodies using head and hand sensors in consumer-grade virtual reality applications (5). These methods aim to increase embodiment, support interaction involving arms or shoulders, and improve overall user experience.

To overcome this challenge, we propose Extended WSD Incorporating Sense Embeddings (EWISE), a supervised model to perform WSD by predicting over a continuous sense embedding space as opposed to a discrete label space. This allows EWISE to generalize over both seen and unseen senses, thus achieving generalized zero-shot learning. To obtain target sense embeddings, EWISE utilizes sense definitions. EWISE learns a novel sentence encoder for sense definitions by using WordNet relations and also ConvE, a recently proposed knowledge graph embedding method. We also compare EWISE against other sentence encoders pretrained on large corpora to generate definition embeddings. EWISE achieves new state-of-the-art WSD performance.",,"multi-task identification of entities, relations, and coreference for scientific knowledge graph construction","We introduce a multi-task setup of identifying entities, relations, and coreference clusters in scientific articles. We create SciERC, a dataset that includes annotations for all three tasks and develop a unified framework called SciIE with shared span representations. The multi-task setup reduces cascading errors between tasks and leverages cross-sentence relations through coreference links. Experiments show that our multi-task model outperforms previous models in scientific information extraction without using any domain-specific features. We further show that the framework supports construction of a scientific knowledge graph, which we use to analyze information in scientific literature.",10.18653/v1/d18-1360,the wisdom of minority: unsupervised slot filling validation based on multi-dimensional truth-finding,"Information Extraction using multiple information sources and systems is beneficial due to multisource/system consolidation and challenging due to the resulting inconsistency and redundancy. We integrate IE and truth-finding research and present a novel unsupervised multi-dimensional truth finding framework which incorporates signals from multiple sources, multiple systems and multiple pieces of evidence by knowledge graph construction through multi-layer deep linguistic analysis. Experiments on the case study of Slot Filling Validation demonstrate that our approach can find truths accurately (9.4% higher F-score than supervised methods) and efficiently (finding 90% truths with only one half the cost of a baseline without credibility estimation).",,integration of knowledge graph embedding into topic modeling with hierarchical dirichlet process,"Leveraging domain knowledge is an effective strategy for enhancing the quality of inferred low-dimensional representations of documents by topic models. In this paper, we develop topic modeling with knowledge graph embedding (TMKGE), a Bayesian nonparametric model to employ knowledge graph (KG) embedding in the context of topic modeling, for extracting more coherent topics. Specifically, we build a hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) based model to flexibly borrow information from KG to improve the interpretability of topics. An efficient online variational inference method based on a stick-breaking construction of HDP is developed for TMKGE, making TMKGE suitable for large document corpora and KGs. Experiments on three public datasets illustrate the superior performance of TMKGE in terms of topic coherence and document classification accuracy, compared to state-of-the-art topic modeling methods.",,compare to the knowledge: graph neural fake news detection with external knowledge,"Nowadays, fake news detection, which aims to verify whether a news document is trusted or fake, has become urgent and important. Most existing methods rely heavily on linguistic and semantic features from the news content, and fail to effectively exploit external knowledge which could help determine whether the news document is trusted. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end graph neural model called CompareNet, which compares the news to the knowledge base (KB) through entities for fake news detection. Considering that fake news detection is correlated with topics, we also incorporate topics to enrich the news representation. Specifically, we first construct a directed heterogeneous document graph for each news incorporating topics and entities. Based on the graph, we develop a heterogeneous graph attention network for learning the topic-enriched news representation as well as the contextual entity representations that encode the semantics of the news content. The contextual entity representations are then compared to the corresponding KB-based entity representations through a carefully designed entity comparison network, to capture the consistency between the news content and KB. Finally, the topic-enriched news representation combining the entity comparison features is fed into a fake news classifier. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that CompareNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",,"In addressing the research problem of entity linking, recent methodologies have demonstrated diverse approaches to improve disambiguation and knowledge integration. EWISE leverages a novel sentence encoder and sense definition embeddings to perform zero-shot word sense disambiguation, generalizing over both seen and unseen senses by predicting over a continuous sense embedding space (1). SciIE adopts a multi-task framework for entity, relation, and coreference identification, utilizing shared span representations to reduce cascading errors and support the construction of scientific knowledge graphs without domain-specific features (2). An unsupervised multi-dimensional truth-finding framework is introduced in (3), which integrates information extraction and truth-finding by constructing knowledge graphs through deep linguistic analysis, demonstrating improved accuracy in slot filling validation. TMKGE integrates knowledge graph embeddings into topic modeling using a hierarchical Dirichlet process, enhancing topic coherence and document classification by borrowing information from knowledge graphs (4). CompareNet, a graph neural model, contrasts news content with external knowledge bases through entities and incorporates topics to enrich news representation, significantly outperforming existing methods in fake news detection (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of integrating continuous embeddings, multi-task learning, unsupervised validation, and external knowledge bases to advance the precision and adaptability of entity linking systems.","{

1135,Computational Engineering,Computational Engineering,Exploring Role of Semantic IoT ,ExtruOnt: An ontology for describing a type of manufacturing machine for Industry 4.0 systems,"Semantically rich descriptions of manufacturing machines, offered in a machine-interpretable code, can provide interesting benefits in Industry 4.0 scenarios. However, the lack of that type of descriptions is evident. In this paper we present the development effort made to build an ontology, called ExtruOnt, for describing a type of manufacturing machine, more precisely, a type that performs an extrusion process (extruder). Although the scope of the ontology is restricted to a concrete domain, it could be used as a model for the development of other ontologies for describing manufacturing machines in Industry 4.0 scenarios. The terms of the ExtruOnt ontology provide different types of information related with an extruder, which are reflected in distinct modules that constitute the ontology. Thus, it contains classes and properties for expressing descriptions about components of an extruder, spatial connections, features, and 3D representations of those components, and finally the sensors used to capture indicators about the performance of this type of machine. The ontology development process has been carried out in close collaboration with domain experts.",10.3233/sw-200376,SAREF4INMA: A SAREF extension for the industry and manufacturing domain,"The IoT landscape is characterized by a fragmentation of standards, platforms and technologies, often scattered among different vertical domains. To prevent the market to continue to be fragmented and power-less, a protocol-independent semantic layer can serve as enabler of interoperability among the various smart devices from different manufacturers that co-exist in a specific industry domain, but also across different domains. To that end, the SAREF ontology was created in 2015 with the intention to interconnect data, enabling the communication between IoT devices that use different protocols and standards. A number of industrial sectors consequently expressed their interest to extend SAREF into their domains in order to fill the gaps of the semantics not yet covered by their communication protocols. Therefore, the SAREF4INMA ontology was recently created to extend SAREF for describing the Smart Industry & Manufacturing domain. SAREF4INMA is based on several standards and IoT initiatives, as well as on real use cases, and includes classes, properties and instances specifically created to cover the industry and manufacturing domain. This work describes the approach followed to develop this ontology, specifies its requirements and also includes a practical example of how to use it.",10.3233/sw-200402,IoT-Lite: a lightweight semantic model for the internet of things and its use with dynamic semantics,"Over the past few years, the semantics community has developed several ontologies to describe concepts and relationships for internet of things (IoT) applications. A key problem is that most of the IoT-related semantic descriptions are not as widely adopted as expected. One of the main concerns of users and developers is that semantic techniques increase the complexity and processing time, and therefore, they are unsuitable for dynamic and responsive environments such as the IoT. To address this concern, we propose IoT-Lite, an instantiation of the semantic sensor network ontology to describe key IoT concepts allowing interoperability and discovery of sensory data in heterogeneous IoT platforms by a lightweight semantics. We propose 10 rules for good and scalable semantic model design and follow them to create IoT-Lite. We also demonstrate the scalability of IoT-Lite by providing some experimental analysis and assess IoT-Lite against another solution in terms of round trip time performance for query-response times. We have linked IoT-Lite with stream annotation ontology, to allow queries over stream data annotations, and we have also added dynamic semantics in the form of MathML annotations to IoT-Lite. Dynamic semantics allows the annotation of spatio-temporal values, reducing storage requirements and therefore the response time for queries. Dynamic semantics stores mathematical formulas to recover estimated values when actual values are missing.The research leading to these results has

SOSA is the result of rethinking the W3C-XG Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology based on changes in scope and target audience, technical developments, and lessons learned over the past years. SOSA also acts as a replacement of SSN’s Stimulus Sensor Observation (SSO) core. It has been developed by the first joint working group of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) on Spatial Data on the Web. In this work, we motivate the need for SOSA, provide an overview of the main classes and properties, and briefly discuss its integration with the new release of the SSN ontology as well as various other alignments to specifications such as OGC’s Observations and Measurements (O&M), Dolce-Ultralite (DUL), and other prominent ontologies. We will also touch upon common modelling problems and application areas related to publishing and searching observation, sampling, and actuation data on the Web. The SOSA ontology and standard can be accessed at https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/",10.1016/j.websem.2018.06.003,AutomationML Ontology: Modeling Cyber-Physical Systems for Industry 4.0,"We present an AutomationML ontology (AMLO) that covers the CAEX part of the AutomationML standard. The AutomationML data format facilitates the engineering data exchange during industrial systems design. Having a semantic representation of the AutomationML standard allows industrial practitioners to interlink and integrate heterogeneous data more efficiently and to benefit from the Semantic Web tools and technology stack, while at the same time, using a familiar domain-specific conceptualization. Compared to earlier efforts for semantically representing AutomationML, AMLO (a) covers the entire CAEX standard, and not just portions relevant for a use case; (b) has been developed following best practices for ontology engineering; and (c) is made openly available for the community by following latest guidelines on resource sharing and publishing. We describe AMLO and demonstrate its use in reallife scenarios for improving engineering processes in CyberPhysical System design.",,"In addressing the fragmentation and interoperability challenges within the Semantic Internet of Things (IoT), the methodologies employed across five studies showcase a convergence towards ontology-based solutions tailored for specific domains and applications. ExtruOnt's development process involved close collaboration with domain experts to create a detailed ontology for extrusion manufacturing machines, focusing on components, spatial connections, and sensor data (1). Similarly, SAREF4INMA extended the SAREF ontology to cater to the Smart Industry & Manufacturing domain, incorporating standards, IoT initiatives, and real use cases to ensure comprehensive coverage of the domain's semantics (2). IoT-Lite adopted a more streamlined approach, creating a lightweight semantic model by following ten design rules aimed at maintaining scalability and responsiveness, and integrating dynamic semantics to handle spatio-temporal data efficiently (3). The SOSA ontology, on the other hand, was developed through a joint effort by the OGC and W3C, providing a lightweight specification for modeling observations, actuations, and sampling, with alignments to various specifications and standards (4). Lastly, the AutomationML Ontology (AMLO) was designed to semantically represent the entire CAEX part of the AutomationML standard, following best practices in ontology engineering and making the ontology openly available, thus facilitating the integration of heterogeneous data in Cyber-Physical System design (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of domain-specific ontologies, collaboration with experts, adherence to best practices, and the balance between richness and lightweight design for effective Semantic IoT applications.","{

1143,Medicine and Health,Sociology,Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on well-being,The COVID-19 pandemic and subjective well-being: longitudinal evidence on satisfaction with work and family,"ABSTRACT This paper provides a timely evaluation of whether the main COVID-19 lockdown policies – remote work, short-time work and closure of schools and childcare – have an immediate effect on the German population in terms of changes in satisfaction with work and family life. Relying on individual level panel data collected before and during the lockdown, we examine (1) how family satisfaction and work satisfaction of individuals have changed over the lockdown period, and (2) how lockdown-driven changes in the labour market situation (i.e. working remotely and being sent on short-time work) have affected satisfactions. We apply first-difference regressions for mothers, fathers, and persons without children. Our results show a general decrease in family satisfaction. We also find an overall decline in work satisfaction which is most pronounced for mothers and those without children who have to switch to short-time work. In contrast, fathers' well-being is less affected negatively and their family satisfaction even increased after changing to short-time work. We conclude that while the lockdown circumstances generally have a negative effect on the satisfaction with work and family of individuals in Germany, effects differ between childless persons, mothers, and fathers with the latter being least negatively affected.",10.1080/14616696.2020.1833066,Socioeconomic status and well-being during COVID-19: A resource-based examination.,"The authors assess levels and within-person changes in psychological well-being (i.e., depressive symptoms and life satisfaction) from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic for individuals in the United States, in general and by socioeconomic status (SES). The data is from 2 surveys of 1,143 adults from RAND Corporation's nationally representative American Life Panel, the first administered between April-June, 2019 and the second during the initial peak of the pandemic in the United States in April, 2020. Depressive symptoms during the pandemic were higher than population norms before the pandemic. Depressive symptoms increased from before to during COVID-19 and life satisfaction decreased. Individuals with higher education experienced a greater increase in depressive symptoms and a greater decrease in life satisfaction from before to during COVID-19 in comparison to those with lower education. Supplemental analysis illustrates that income had a curvilinear relationship with changes in well-being, such that individuals at the highest levels of income experienced a greater decrease in life satisfaction from before to during COVID-19 than individuals with lower levels of income. We draw on conservation of resources theory and the theory of fundamental social causes to examine four key mechanisms (perceived financial resources, perceived control, interpersonal resources, and COVID-19-related knowledge/news consumption) underlying the relationship between SES and well-being during COVID-19. These resources explained changes in well-being for the sample as a whole but did not provide insight into why individuals of higher education experienced a greater decline in well-being from before to during COVID-19.

An analysis of changes in stress and well-being in Switzerland,"ABSTRACT This study analyses the consequences of the Covid-19 crisis on stress and well-being in Switzerland. In particular, we assess whether vulnerable groups in terms of social isolation, increased workload and limited socioeconomic resources are affected more than others. Using longitudinal data from the Swiss Household Panel, including a specific Covid-19 study, we estimate change score models to predict changes in perceived stress and life satisfaction at the end of the semi-lockdown in comparison to before the crisis. We find no general change in life satisfaction and a small decrease in stress. Yet, in line with our expectations, more vulnerable groups in terms of social isolation (young adults, Covid-19 risk group members, individuals without a partner), workload (women) and socioeconomic resources (unemployed and those who experienced a deteriorating financial situation) reported a decrease in life satisfaction.

We specifically focus on the role of day care center and school closures, which may be regarded as a “disruptive exogenous shock” to family life. We make use of a novel representative survey of parental well-being collected in May and June 2020 in Germany, when schools and day care centers were closed but while other measures had been relaxed and new infections were low. In our descriptive analysis, we compare well-being during this period with a pre-crisis period for different groups. In a difference-in-differences design, we compare the change for individuals with children to the change for individuals without children, accounting for unrelated trends as well as potential survey mode and context effects. We find that the crisis lowered the relative well-being of individuals with children, especially for individuals with young children, for women, and for persons with lower secondary schooling qualifications.

Objectives
To investigate early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic related to (a) levels of worry, risk perception, and social distancing; (b) longitudinal effects on well-being; and (c) effects of worry, risk perception, and social distancing on well-being.


Methods
We analyzed annual changes in four aspects of well-being over 5 years (2015–2020): life satisfaction, financial satisfaction, self-rated health, and loneliness in a subsample (n = 1,071, aged 65–71) from a larger survey of Swedish older adults. The 2020 wave, collected March 26–April 2, included measures of worry, risk perception, and social distancing in response to COVID-19.


Results
(a) In relation to COVID-19: 44.9% worried about health, 69.5% about societal consequences, 25.1% about financial consequences; 86.4% perceived a high societal risk, 42.3% a high risk of infection, and 71.2% reported high levels of social distancing. (b) Well-being remained stable (life satisfaction and loneliness) or even increased (self-rated health and financial satisfaction) in 2020 compared to previous years. (c) More worry about health and financial consequences was related to lower scores in all four well-being measures. Higher societal worry and more social distancing were related to higher well-being.


Discussion
In the early stage of the pandemic, Swedish older adults on average rated their well-being as high as, or even higher than, previous years. However, those who worried more reported lower well-being. Our findings speak to the resilience, but also heterogeneity, among older adults during the pandemic. Further research, on a broad range of health factors and long-term psychological consequences, is needed.",10.1093/geronb/gbaa084,"The methodologies employed across five studies investigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on well-being provide a multifaceted approach to understanding this complex issue. The first study utilized longitudinal individual-level panel data and first-difference regressions to assess changes in work and family satisfaction in Germany during lockdown, distinguishing between mothers, fathers, and childless individuals (1). Similarly, the third study leveraged longitudinal data from the Swiss Household Panel to estimate change score models, focusing on stress and life satisfaction changes among various vulnerable groups (3). In contrast, the second study drew from two surveys of a nationally representative panel in the United States, comparing pre-pandemic and pandemic levels of depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, and applying theories to explore the underlying mechanisms of SES on well-being (2). The fourth study adopted a difference-in-differences design using a representative survey of parental well-being in Germany, comparing individuals with and without dependent children to isolate the impact of school and daycare closures (4). Lastly, the fifth study analyzed annual changes in well-being over five years among Swedish older adults, incorporating measures specific to COVID-19-related worry, risk perception, and social distancing, to assess their impact on well-being (5). Collectively, these methodological approaches, ranging from regression analyses to difference-in-differences and change score models, provide a comprehensive picture of the pandemic's impact on well-being across different demographics and socioeconomic statuses, while also accounting for the temporal dynamics of the crisis.","{

}","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a multifaceted impact on individual well-being, with variations observed across different demographics and socioeconomic statuses. Longitudinal studies from Germany and Switzerland indicate a general decline in satisfaction with work and family life, particularly among mothers and those without children who were shifted to short-time work, while fathers seemed to be less negatively affected (1, 3). In the United States, the pandemic exacerbated depressive symptoms and reduced life satisfaction, with those of higher education experiencing a greater decline, suggesting that socioeconomic status plays a critical role in the psychological impact of the pandemic (2). Moreover, in Germany, the well-being of parents, especially mothers and those with lower educational qualifications, was disproportionately lowered due to the closure of schools and daycare centers, highlighting the strain on family life and potential long-term implications for child development and parental labor market outcomes (4). In contrast, older adults in Sweden demonstrated resilience, with many reporting stable or even improved well-being, although increased worry about health and financial consequences was associated with lower well-being, underscoring the heterogeneity in responses to the pandemic among this demographic (5). Collectively, these findings reveal that the pandemic's effect on well-being is complex and influenced by factors such as family structure, socioeconomic resources, and individual resilience, necessitating tailored policy responses to mitigate its negative consequences (1-5).","{

}","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a multifaceted impact on well-being, with research indicating both negative and positive effects across different demographics and countries. A longitudinal study in Germany found that the lockdown policies led to a general decrease in family satisfaction and work satisfaction, with mothers and childless individuals experiencing a pronounced decline in work satisfaction when switching to short-time work, while fathers showed a lesser negative impact and even an increase in family satisfaction under similar conditions (1). In the United States, socioeconomic status played a significant role, as individuals with higher education reported greater increases in depressive symptoms and decreases in life satisfaction during the pandemic, with financial resources, perceived control, and interpersonal resources being key mechanisms affecting well-being (2). In Switzerland, no general change in life satisfaction was observed, but vulnerable groups such as young adults, women, and those with limited socioeconomic resources experienced a decrease in life satisfaction and stress, with stress levels decreasing most among high earners and the highly educated (3). In Germany, parental well-being was adversely affected by school and daycare closures, particularly for parents with young children, women, and those with lower secondary schooling qualifications, highlighting the disruptive impact of COVID-19 containment measures on family life (4). Conversely, a study of Swedish older adults found that well-being remained stable or even increased during the early stages of the pandemic, with higher levels of worry correlating with lower well-being, suggesting resilience among this demographic but also a heterogeneity in responses to the pandemic (5). These studies collectively underscore the complex and varied effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on well-being, influenced by factors such as family structure, socioeconomic status, and age.","{

}","This synthesis explores the methodologies used in five studies investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on well-being. Paper 1 (1) examined changes in family satisfaction and work satisfaction among Germans during the lockdown period using individual level panel data. Paper 2 (2) assessed psychological well-being, including depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, for individuals in the United States before and during the pandemic, with a focus on socioeconomic status. Paper 3 (3) utilized longitudinal data from Switzerland to evaluate perceived stress and life satisfaction changes among vulnerable groups affected by social isolation, increased workload, or limited socioeconomic resources. Paper 4 (4) analyzed parental well-being in Germany during the crisis, focusing on day care center and school closures' effects on individuals with children. Lastly, Paper 5 (5) investigated older adults' well-being in Sweden, examining levels of worry, risk perception, social distancing, and their impact on well-being.

The studies employed various data collection methods, including surveys and longitudinal data analysis, to assess changes in well-being during the pandemic. They also focused on different aspects of well-being, such as family satisfaction, psychological well-being, perceived stress, and socioeconomic factors. The results showed mixed outcomes, with some studies reporting decreases in well-being for specific groups, while others found no change or even improvements. Overall, these studies contribute valuable insights into the complex relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and well-being, highlighting the importance of considering various sociodemographic factors and contexts when evaluating its impact.","{

1148,Computational Linguistics,Linguistics,Named Entity Recognition,Chinese named entity recognition using role model,"This paper presents a stochastic model to tackle the problem of Chinese named entity recognition. In this research, we unify component tokens of named entity and their contexts into a generalized role set, which is like part-of-speech (POS). The probabilities of role emission and transition are acquired after machine learning on a role-labeled data set, which is transformed from a hand-corrected corpus after word segmentation and POS tagging are performed. Given an original string, role Viterbi tagging is employed on tokens segmented in the initial process. Then named entities are identified and classified through maximum matching on the best role sequence. In addition, named entity recognition using role model is incorporated along with the unified class-based bigram model for word segmentation. Thus, named entity candidates can be further selected in the final process of Chinese lexical analysis. Various evaluations conducted using one",,Named entity recognition for chinese social media with jointly trained embeddings,"We consider the task of named entity recognition for Chinese social media. The long line of work in Chinese NER has focused on formal domains, and NER for social media has been largely restricted to English. We present a new corpus of Weibo messages annotated for both name and nominal mentions. Additionally, we evaluate three types of neural embeddings for representing Chinese text. Finally, we propose a joint training objective for the embeddings that makes use of both (NER) labeled and unlabeled raw text. Our methods yield a 9% improvement over a stateof-the-art baseline.",,Chinese Named Entity Recognition with Multiple Features,"This paper proposes a hybrid Chinese named entity recognition model based on multiple features. It differentiates from most of the previous approaches mainly as follows. Firstly, the proposed Hybrid Model integrates coarse particle feature (POS Model) with fine particle feature (Word Model), so that it can overcome the disadvantages of each other. Secondly, in order to reduce the searching space and improve the efficiency, we introduce heuristic human knowledge into statistical model, which could increase the performance of NER significantly. Thirdly, we use three sub-models to respectively describe three kinds of transliterated person name, that is, Japanese, Russian and Euramerican person name, which can improve the performance of PN recognition. From the experimental results on People's Daily testing data, we can conclude that our Hybrid Model is better than the models which only use one kind of features. And the experiments on MET-2 testing data also confirm the above conclusion, which show that our algorithm has consistence on different testing data.",,The multilingual entity task (MET) overview,"In November, 1996, the Message Understanding Conference-6 (MUC-6) evaluation of named entity identification demonstrated that systems are approaching human performance on English language texts [10]. Informal and anonymous, the MET provided a new opportunity to assess progress on the same task in Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese. Preliminary results indicate that MET systems in all three languages performed comparably to those of the MUC-6 evaluation in English.",,Recognizing unregistered names for mandarin word identification,"Word Identification has been an important and active issue in Chinese Natural Language Processing. In this paper, a new mechanism, based on the concept of sublanguage, is proposed for identifying unknown words, especially personal names, in Chinese newspapers. The proposed mechanism includes title-driven name recognition, adaptive dynamic word formation, identification of 2-character and 3-character Chinese names without title. We will show the experimental results for two corpora and compare them with the results by the NTHU's statistic-based system, the only system that we know has attacked the same problem. The experimental results have shown significant improvements over the WI systems without the name identification capability.",,"In addressing the challenge of Named Entity Recognition (NER) in Chinese text, researchers have employed a variety of methodologies, each contributing to the advancement of the field. One approach introduced a stochastic role model that unifies tokens and their contexts into a generalized role set, using role Viterbi tagging and maximum matching for entity identification (1). Another study focused on Chinese social media, presenting a new annotated corpus and evaluating neural embeddings, with a joint training objective that leverages both labeled and unlabeled text, achieving a significant improvement over previous models (2). A hybrid model was proposed that combines coarse and fine particle features, integrating heuristic human knowledge to reduce search space and improve efficiency, and employing sub-models for different types of transliterated person names, demonstrating consistency across various datasets (3). While these studies have made strides in formal text and social media contexts, the multilingual entity task (MET) overview suggests that systems in multiple languages, including Chinese, are approaching human performance levels in named entity identification (4). Additionally, a mechanism based on the concept of sublanguage was proposed for identifying unregistered names, incorporating title-driven recognition and adaptive dynamic word formation, showing significant improvements over systems without name identification capabilities (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of integrating linguistic features, statistical models, and machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of NER systems.","{

Given a document in any of these languages, our framework is able to identify name mentions, assign a coarse-grained or fine-grained type to each mention, and link it to an English Knowledge Base (KB) if it is linkable. We achieve this goal by performing a series of new KB mining methods: generating “silver-standard” annotations by transferring annotations from English to other languages through cross-lingual links and KB properties, refining annotations through self-training and topic selection, deriving language-specific morphology features from anchor links, and mining word translation pairs from cross-lingual links. Both name tagging and linking results for 282 languages are promising on Wikipedia data and on-Wikipedia data.",10.18653/v1/p17-1178,WiNER: A Wikipedia Annotated Corpus for Named Entity Recognition,"We revisit the idea of mining Wikipedia in order to generate named-entity annotations.

In this paper, we address the well-known issue of data scarcity in NER, especially relevant when moving to a multilingual scenario, and go beyond current approaches to the creation of multilingual silver data for the task. We exploit the texts of Wikipedia and introduce a new methodology based on the effective combination of knowledge-based approaches and neural models, together with a novel domain adaptation technique, to produce high-quality training corpora for NER. We evaluate our datasets extensively on standard benchmarks for NER, yielding substantial improvements of up to 6 span-based F1-score points over previous state-of-the-art systems for data creation.",10.18653/v1/2021.findings-emnlp.215,Learning multilingual named entity recognition from Wikipedia,"AbstractWe automatically create enormous, free and multilingual silver-standard training annotations for named entity recognition (ner) by exploiting the text and structure of Wikipedia. Most ner systems rely on statistical models of annotated data to identify and classify names of people, locations and organisations in text. This dependence on expensive annotation is the knowledge bottleneck our work overcomes.We first classify each Wikipedia article into named entity (ne) types, training and evaluating on 7200 manually-labelled Wikipedia articles across nine languages. Our cross-lingual approach achieves up to 95% accuracy.We transform the links between articles into ne annotations by projecting the target articleʼs classifications onto the anchor text. This approach yields reasonable annotations, but does not immediately compete with existing gold-standard data. By inferring additional links and heuristically tweaking the Wikipedia corpora, we better align our automatic annotations to gold standards.We annotate millions of words in nine languages, evaluating English, German, Spanish, Dutch and Russian Wikipedia-trained models against conll shared task data and other gold-standard corpora. Our approach outperforms other approaches to automatic ne annotation (Richman and Schone, 2008 [61], Mika et al., 2008 [46]) competes with gold-standard training when tested on an evaluation corpus from a different source; and performs 10% better than newswire-trained models on manually-annotated Wikipedia text",10.1016/j.artint.2012.03.006,Named Entity Recognition in Wikipedia,"Named entity recognition (NER) is used in many domains beyond the newswire text that comprises current gold-standard corpora. Recent work has used Wikipedia's link structure to automatically generate near gold-standard annotations. Until now, these resources have only been evaluated on newswire corpora or themselves. 
 
We present the first NER evaluation on a Wikipedia gold standard (WG) corpus. Our analysis of cross-corpus performance on WG shows that Wikipedia text may be a harder NER domain than newswire. We find that an automatic annotation of Wikipedia has high agreement with WG and, when used as training data, outperforms newswire models by up to 7.7%.",,"In addressing the challenge of multilingual named entity recognition (NER), recent methodologies have leveraged the extensive multilingual content of Wikipedia to generate silver-standard training data. The cross-lingual name tagging and linking framework developed in (1) utilizes a series of novel KB mining methods, including the transfer of annotations from English to other languages, self-training, and the extraction of language-specific morphological features. Similarly, the WiNER corpus (2) applies a new methodology to mine Wikipedia for named-entity annotations, showing that LSTM-CRF models particularly benefit from this data. The WikiNEuRal approach (3) combines knowledge-based methods with neural models and domain adaptation techniques to create high-quality multilingual silver data, resulting in substantial improvements in NER tasks. Another study (4) classifies Wikipedia articles into NE types and projects these classifications onto anchor texts to generate annotations, further refining the data by inferring additional links and heuristic adjustments. Lastly, research in (5) evaluates the effectiveness of Wikipedia-derived annotations against a Wikipedia gold standard corpus, demonstrating that these annotations can outperform models trained on newswire text. Collectively, these methodologies underscore the potential of Wikipedia as a resource for enhancing NER systems across multiple languages, with a focus on innovative data mining and adaptation strategies to overcome the scarcity of annotated data in less-resourced languages (1-5).","{

1159,Science and Technology Studies,Science and Technology Studies,COVID-19 Fake News Detection,Deep transfer learning for COVID‐19 fake news detection in Persian,"The spread of fake news on social media has increased dramatically in recent years. Hence, fake news detection systems have received researchers' attention globally. During the COVID‐19 outbreak in 2019 and the worldwide epidemic, the importance of this issue becomes more apparent. Due to the importance of the issue, a large number of researchers have begun to collect English datasets and to study COVID‐19 fake news detection. However, there are a large number of low‐resource languages, including Persian, that cannot develop accurate tools for automatic COVID‐19 fake news detection due to the lack of annotated data for the task. In this article, we aim to develop a corpus for Persian in the domain of COVID‐19 where the fake news is annotated and to provide a model for detecting Persian COVID‐19 fake news. With the impressive advancement of multilingual pre‐trained language models, the idea of cross‐lingual transfer learning can be proposed to improve the generalization of models trained with low‐resource language datasets. Accordingly, we use the state‐of‐the‐art deep cross‐lingual contextualized language model, XLM‐RoBERTa, and the parallel convolutional neural networks to detect Persian COVID‐19 fake news. Moreover, we use the idea of knowledge transferring across‐domains to improve the results by using both the English COVID‐19 dataset and the general domain Persian fake news dataset. The combination of both cross‐lingual and cross‐domain transfer learning has outperformed the models and it has beaten the baseline by 2.39% significantly.",10.1111/exsy.13008,COVID-19 Fake News Detection System,"This article deals with the problem of the rapidly increasing COVID-19 infodemic in the world. Thus, there is a need for an effective framework of detecting fake information or misleading news related to COVID-19 virus/disease. To resolve this, we have used a dataset obtained from ConstraintAI'21. The dataset consists of 10,700 tweets and online posts of fake and real news concerning COVID-19. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms compared in this paper to classify the given news or tweet into real or fake are Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm. Two feature extraction techniques were used count vectorization and TF-IDF. Deep Learning (DL) algorithms implemented using Adam optimizer are Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The best testing accuracy was achieved with the LSVM model using TF-IDF feature extraction method followed by Stochastic Gradient Descent classifier with TF-IDF feature extraction technique. LR, DT, and RFC performed better with the Count vectorization feature extraction technique, whereas LSVM, KNN, NB and SGD had better accuracy with TF-IDF feature extraction technique. The LSTM model performed slightly better among the DL algorithms.",10.1109/confluence52989.2022.9734144,Comparing Traditional Machine Learning Methods for COVID-19 Fake News,"This article describes some supervised classification techniques for COVID-19 fake news detection in English, where the sources of data are annotated posts from various social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram.

In this Situation, models trained with Support Vector Machine and Naïve Bayes algorithms outperformed all other strategies.",10.1109/acit53391.2021.9677453,Transfer learning and GRU-CRF augmentation for Covid-19 fake news detection,"The spread of fake news on online media is very dangerous and can lead to casualties, effects on psychology, character assassination, elections for political parties, and state chaos. Fake news that concerning Covid-19 massively spread during the pandemic.

It also showed that BERT gave a better result than GPT2 in all models; the highest accuracy we achieved for BERT is 0.9196, and GPT2 is 0.8986.",10.2298/csis210501053k,Selective Feature Sets Based Fake News Detection for COVID-19 to Manage Infodemic,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the spread of fake news became easy due to the wide use of social media platforms. Considering the problematic consequences of fake news, efforts have been made for the timely detection of fake news using machine learning and deep learning models. Such works focus on model optimization and feature engineering and the extraction part is under-explored area. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to investigate the impact of features to obtain high performance. For this purpose, this study analyzes the impact of different subset feature selection techniques on the performance of models for fake news detection. Principal component analysis and Chi-square are investigated for feature selection using machine learning and pre-trained deep learning models. Additionally, the influence of different preprocessing steps is also analyzed regarding fake news detection. Results obtained from comprehensive experiments reveal that the extra tree classifier outperforms with a 0.9474 accuracy when trained on the combination of term frequency-inverse document frequency and bag of words features. Models tend to yield poor results if no preprocessing or partial processing is carried out. Convolutional neural network, long short term memory network, residual neural network (ResNet), and InceptionV3 show marginally lower performance than the extra tree classifier. Results reveal that using subset features also helps to achieve robustness for machine learning models.",10.1109/access.2022.3206963,"In addressing the challenge of detecting COVID-19 related fake news, researchers have employed a variety of methodologies, leveraging both traditional machine learning (ML) and advanced deep learning (DL) techniques. The use of pre-trained language models like XLM-RoBERTa, combined with parallel convolutional neural networks, has shown promise in cross-lingual transfer learning, particularly for low-resource languages such as Persian, achieving significant improvements over baseline models (1). Traditional ML algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machine, have been compared using feature extraction methods like count vectorization and TF-IDF, with the latter often yielding better accuracy (2, 3). The integration of transfer learning with GRU-CRF augmentation has also been explored, with models like BERT and GPT2 demonstrating high accuracy in detecting fake news, indicating the effectiveness of hybrid models with feature augmentation (4). Furthermore, the impact of selective feature sets on model performance has been investigated, revealing that models like the extra tree classifier can achieve high accuracy when trained on a combination of TF-IDF and bag of words features, underscoring the importance of feature selection and preprocessing in enhancing model robustness (5).

1172,Cryptography and Security,Computer Sciences,Software-Defined Networking Security ,FLOWGUARD: building robust firewalls for software-defined networks,"Software-Defined Networking (SDN) introduces significant granularity, visibility and flexibility to networking, but at the same time brings forth new security challenges. One of the fundamental challenges is to build robust firewalls for protecting OpenFlow-based networks where network states and traffic are frequently changed. To address this challenge, we introduce FlowGuard, a comprehensive framework, to facilitate not only accurate detection but also effective resolution of firewall policy violations in dynamic OpenFlow-based networks. FlowGuard checks network flow path spaces to detect firewall policy violations when network states are updated. In addition, FlowGuard conducts automatic and real-time violation resolutions with the help of several innovative resolution strategies designed for diverse network update situations. We also implement our framework and demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed detection and resolution approaches in FlowGuard through experiments with a real-world network topology.",,FlowRanger: A request prioritizing algorithm for controller DoS attacks in Software Defined Networks,"Software Defined Networking (SDN) introduces a new communication network management paradigm and has gained much attention from academia and industry. However, the centralized nature of SDN is a potential vulnerability to the system since attackers may launch denial of services (DoS) attacks against the controller. Existing solutions limit requests rate to the controller by dropping overflowed requests, but they also drop legitimate requests to the controller. To address this problem, we propose FlowRanger, a buffer prioritizing solution for controllers to handle routing requests based on their likelihood to be attacking requests, which derives the trust values of the requesting sources. Based on their trust values, FlowRanger classifies routing requests into multiple buffer queues with different priorities. Thus, attacking requests are served with a lower priority than regular requests. Our simulation results demonstrates that FlowRanger can significantly enhance the request serving rate of regular users under DoS attacks against the controller. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first solution to battle against controller DoS attacks on the controller side.",,Lightweight DDoS flooding attack detection using NOX/OpenFlow,"Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks became one of the main Internet security problems over the last decade, threatening public web servers in particular. Although the DDoS mechanism is widely understood, its detection is a very hard task because of the similarities between normal traffic and useless packets, sent by compromised hosts to their victims. This work presents a lightweight method for DDoS attack detection based on traffic flow features, in which the extraction of such information is made with a very low overhead compared to traditional approaches. This is possible due to the use of the NOX platform which provides a programmatic interface to facilitate the handling of switch information. Other major contributions include the high rate of detection and very low rate of false alarms obtained by flow analysis using Self Organizing Maps.",,A comprehensive security architecture for SDN,"SDN enables the administrators to configure network resources very quickly and to adjust network-wide traffic flow to meet changing needs dynamically. However, there are some challenges for implementing a full-scale carrier SDN. One of the most important challenges is SDN security, which is beginning to receive attention. With new SDN architecture, some security threats are common to traditional networking, but the profile of these threats (including their likelihood and impact and hence their overall risk level) changes. Moreover, there are some new security challenges such as bypassing predefined mandatory policies by overwriting flow entries and data eavesdropping by inserting fraudulent flow entries. This paper is to design open-flow specific security solutions and propose a comprehensive security architecture to provide security services such as enforcing mandatory network policy correctly and receiving network policy securely for SDN in order to solve these common security issues and new security challenges. It can also help the developers to implement security functions to provide security services when developing the SDN controller.",,A secure northbound interface for SDN applications,"Software-Defined Networking (SDN) promises to introduce flexibility and programmability into networks by offering a northbound interface (NBI) for developers to create SDN applications. However, current designs and implementations have several drawbacks, including the lack of extended security features. In this paper, we present a secure northbound interface, through which an SDN controller can offer network resources, such as statistics, flow information or topology data, via a REST-like API to registered SDN applications. A trust manager ensures that only authenticated and trusted applications can utilize the interface. Furthermore, a permission system allows for fine-grained authorization and access control to the aforementioned resources. We present a prototypical implementation of our interface and developed example applications using our interface, including an SDN management dashboard.",,"In addressing the security challenges of Software-Defined Networking (SDN), researchers have developed various methodologies to enhance the robustness and resilience of SDN infrastructures. FlowGuard (1) introduces a framework that detects and resolves firewall policy violations in dynamic OpenFlow-based networks by checking network flow path spaces and employing resolution strategies tailored for different network update scenarios. Similarly, FlowRanger (2) proposes a buffer prioritizing solution that classifies routing requests into multiple queues based on trust values to mitigate controller DoS attacks, ensuring that legitimate requests are served with higher priority than potential attacking requests. In the realm of DDoS attack detection, a lightweight method utilizing traffic flow features and the NOX platform is presented, which achieves high detection rates and low false alarms through the use of Self Organizing Maps (3). Complementing these approaches, a comprehensive security architecture (4) is designed to address both traditional and novel SDN security threats, including the enforcement of mandatory network policies and secure policy reception. Lastly, the development of a secure northbound interface (5) ensures that only authenticated and trusted applications can access network resources, providing fine-grained authorization and access control through a REST-like API. Collectively, these methodologies contribute to a multi-faceted approach to securing SDN environments by addressing specific vulnerabilities and enhancing the overall security posture of SDN systems (1-5).","{

Similarly, the centralized nature of SDN controllers presents a vulnerability to DoS attacks, which FlowRanger aims to mitigate by prioritizing requests based on trust values, thereby enhancing service rates for legitimate requests during attack scenarios (2). The detection of DDoS attacks is also a focal point, with lightweight methods proposed for identifying such threats by analyzing traffic flow features with minimal overhead, as demonstrated using the NOX platform (3). Beyond specific attack vectors, a comprehensive security architecture is proposed to address both traditional and novel SDN security challenges, including the enforcement of mandatory network policies and prevention of fraudulent flow entries (4). Lastly, the security of the northbound interface is highlighted, with solutions like a secure REST-like API that ensures authenticated access and fine-grained control over network resources for SDN applications (5).

It comprises abstracts in 10 STEM disciplines that were found to be the most prolific ones on a major publishing platform. We describe the creation of such a multidisciplinary corpus and highlight the obtained findings in terms of the following features: 1) a generic conceptual formalism for scientific entities in a multidisciplinary scientific context; 2) the feasibility of the domain-independent human annotation of scientific entities under such a generic formalism; 3) a performance benchmark obtainable for automatic extraction of multidisciplinary scientific entities using BERT-based neural models; 4) a delineated 3-step entity resolution procedure for human annotation of the scientific entities via encyclopedic entity linking and lexicographic word sense disambiguation; and 5) human evaluations of Babelfy returned encyclopedic links and lexicographic senses for our entities.

1182,"Ecology and Biodiversity of Animals and Ecosystems, Organismic Interactions",Animal Sciences,Biodiversity inventories with DNA based-tools,Close congruence between Barcode Index Numbers (bins) and species boundaries in the Erebidae (Lepidoptera: Noctuoidea) of the Iberian Peninsula,"Abstract The DNA barcode reference library for Lepidoptera holds much promise as a tool for taxonomic research and for providing the reliable identifications needed for conservation assessment programs. We gathered sequences for the barcode region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene from 160 of the 176 nominal species of Erebidae moths (Insecta: Lepidoptera) known from the Iberian Peninsula. These results arise from a research project which constructing a DNA barcode library for the insect species of Spain. New records for 271 specimens (122 species) are coupled with preexisting data for 38 species from the Iberian fauna. Mean interspecific distance was 12.1%, while the mean nearest neighbour divergence was 6.4%. All 160 species possessed diagnostic barcode sequences, but one pair of congeneric taxa (Eublemma rosea and Eublemma rietzi) were assigned to the same BIN. As well, intraspecific sequence divergences higher than 1.5% were detected in four species which likely represent species complexes. This study reinforces the effectiveness of DNA barcoding as a tool for monitoring biodiversity in particular geographical areas and the strong correspondence between sequence clusters delineated by BINs and species recognized through detailed taxonomic analysis.",10.3897/bdj.5.e19840,Fast Census of Moth Diversity in the Neotropics: A Comparison of Field-Assigned Morphospecies and DNA Barcoding in Tiger Moths,"The morphological species delimitations (i.e. morphospecies) have long been the best way to avoid the taxonomic impediment and compare insect taxa biodiversity in highly diverse tropical and subtropical regions. The development of DNA barcoding, however, has shown great potential to replace (or at least complement) the morphospecies approach, with the advantage of relying on automated methods implemented in computer programs or even online rather than in often subjective morphological features. We sampled moths extensively for two years using light traps in a patch of the highly endangered Atlantic Forest of Brazil to produce a nearly complete census of arctiines (Noctuoidea: Erebidae), whose species richness was compared using different morphological and molecular approaches (DNA barcoding). A total of 1,075 barcode sequences of 286 morphospecies were analyzed. Based on the clustering method Barcode Index Number (BIN) we found a taxonomic bias of approximately 30% in our initial morphological assessment. However, a morphological reassessment revealed that the correspondence between morphospecies and molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) can be up to 94% if differences in genitalia morphology are evaluated in individuals of different MOTUs originated from the same morphospecies (putative cases of cryptic species), and by recording if individuals of different genders in different morphospecies merge together in the same MOTU (putative cases of sexual dimorphism). The results of two other clustering methods (i.e. Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery and 2% threshold) were very similar to those of the BIN approach. Using empirical data we have shown that DNA barcoding performed substantially better than the morphospecies approach, based on superficial morphology, to delimit species of a highly diverse moth taxon, and thus should be used in species inventories.",10.1371/journal.pone.0148423,A DNA barcode library for the butterflies of North America,"Although the butterflies of North America have received considerable taxonomic attention, overlooked species and instances of hybridization continue to be revealed. The present study assembles a DNA barcode reference library for this fauna to identify groups whose patterns of sequence variation suggest the need for further taxonomic study. Based on 14,626 records from 814 species, DNA barcodes were obtained for 96% of the fauna. The maximum intraspecific distance averaged 1/4 the minimum distance to the nearest neighbor, producing a barcode gap in 76% of the species. Most species (80%) were monophyletic, the others were para- or polyphyletic. Although 15% of currently recognized species shared barcodes, the incidence of such taxa was far higher in regions exposed to Pleistocene glaciations than in those that were ice-free. Nearly 10% of species displayed high intraspecific variation (>2.5%), suggesting the need for further investigation to assess potential cryptic diversity. Aside from aiding the identification of all life stages of North American butterflies, the reference library has provided new perspectives on the incidence of both cryptic and potentially over-split species, setting the stage for future studies that can further explore the evolutionary dynamics of this group.",10.7717/peerj.11157,"A DNA barcode reference library for Swiss butterflies and forester moths as a tool for species identification, systematics and conservation","Butterfly monitoring and Red List programs in Switzerland rely on a combination of observations and collection records to document changes in species distributions through time. While most butterflies can be identified using morphology, some taxa remain challenging, making it difficult to accurately map their distributions and develop appropriate conservation measures. In this paper, we explore the use of the DNA barcode (a fragment of the mitochondrial gene COI) as a tool for the identification of Swiss butterflies and forester moths (Rhopalocera and Zygaenidae). We present a national DNA barcode reference library including 868 sequences representing 217 out of 224 resident species, or 96.9% of Swiss fauna. DNA barcodes were diagnostic for nearly 90% of Swiss species. The remaining 10% represent cases of para- and polyphyly likely involving introgression or incomplete lineage sorting among closely related taxa. We demonstrate that integrative taxonomic methods incorporating a combination of morphological and genetic techniques result in a rate of species identification of over 96% in females and over 98% in males, higher than either morphology or DNA barcodes alone. We explore the use of the DNA barcode for exploring boundaries among taxa, understanding the geographical distribution of cryptic diversity and evaluating the status of purportedly endemic taxa. Finally, we discuss how DNA barcodes may be used to improve field practices and ultimately enhance conservation strategies.",10.1371/journal.pone.0208639,DNA barcode reference library for Iberian butterflies enables a continental-scale preview of potential cryptic diversity,"AbstractHow common are cryptic species - those overlooked because of their morphological similarity? Despite its wide-ranging implications for biology and conservation, the answer remains open to debate. Butterflies constitute the best-studied invertebrates, playing a similar role as birds do in providing models for vertebrate biology. An accurate assessment of cryptic diversity in this emblematic group requires meticulous case-by-case assessments, but a preview to highlight cases of particular interest will help to direct future studies. We present a survey of mitochondrial genetic diversity for the butterfly fauna of the Iberian Peninsula with unprecedented resolution (3502 DNA barcodes for all 228 species), creating a reliable system for DNA-based identification and for the detection of overlooked diversity. After compiling available data for European butterflies (5782 sequences, 299 species), we applied the Generalized Mixed Yule-Coalescent model to explore potential cryptic diversity at a continental scale. The results indicate that 27.7% of these species include from two to four evolutionary significant units (ESUs), suggesting that cryptic biodiversity may be higher than expected for one of the best-studied invertebrate groups and regions. The ESUs represent important units for conservation, models for studies of evolutionary and speciation processes and sentinels for future research to unveil hidden diversity.",10.1038/srep12395,"The methodologies employed across these studies underscore the transformative role of DNA barcoding in biodiversity inventories, particularly in the context of Lepidoptera and butterflies. The construction of a DNA barcode library for the Erebidae moths of the Iberian Peninsula (1) and Swiss butterflies and forester moths (4) involved sequencing the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene, revealing high congruence between Barcode Index Numbers (BINs) and species boundaries, with some exceptions hinting at cryptic diversity. Similarly, a comprehensive barcode library for North American butterflies (3) and Iberian butterflies (5) facilitated the identification of overlooked species and potential cryptic diversity, with the latter employing the Generalized Mixed Yule-Coalescent model to predict evolutionary significant units at a continental scale. In the Neotropics, DNA barcoding outperformed morphological species delimitation, with a reassessment of genitalia morphology and sexual dimorphism increasing the correspondence between morphospecies and molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) (2). These studies collectively demonstrate that DNA barcoding is a robust tool for species identification, systematics, and conservation, offering a more objective and reproducible approach than traditional morphology-based methods, and revealing a higher-than-expected prevalence of cryptic species (1-5).","{

}","The burgeoning field of DNA barcoding has revolutionized biodiversity inventories, offering a precise and efficient tool for species identification and the detection of cryptic diversity, which traditional morphological methods may overlook. Studies across various geographical regions, such as the Iberian Peninsula (1, 5), the Neotropics (2), North America (3), and Switzerland (4), have demonstrated the efficacy of DNA barcoding in delineating species boundaries and uncovering hidden diversity within Lepidoptera and butterflies. DNA barcodes have shown a high congruence with species recognized through detailed taxonomic analysis, with some studies reporting diagnostic sequences for over 90% of the species sampled (1, 4). Moreover, DNA barcoding has been instrumental in identifying cases of cryptic species, sexual dimorphism, and potential over-split species, which are critical for conservation and taxonomic efforts (2, 3, 5). The use of Barcode Index Numbers (BINs) and other clustering methods has revealed significant taxonomic biases when relying solely on morphological features, emphasizing the need for integrative approaches that combine morphology with genetic data for species delimitation (2, 4). The application of DNA barcoding in biodiversity inventories not only aids in species identification but also provides insights into the geographical distribution of species and the evolutionary dynamics of faunal groups, thereby setting the stage for future research and enhancing conservation strategies (3, 4, 5).","{

1183,"Ecology and Biodiversity of Animals and Ecosystems, Organismic Interactions",Animal Sciences,Biodiversity inventories with DNA based-tools,Fast Census of Moth Diversity in the Neotropics: A Comparison of Field-Assigned Morphospecies and DNA Barcoding in Tiger Moths,"The morphological species delimitations (i.e. morphospecies) have long been the best way to avoid the taxonomic impediment and compare insect taxa biodiversity in highly diverse tropical and subtropical regions. The development of DNA barcoding, however, has shown great potential to replace (or at least complement) the morphospecies approach, with the advantage of relying on automated methods implemented in computer programs or even online rather than in often subjective morphological features. We sampled moths extensively for two years using light traps in a patch of the highly endangered Atlantic Forest of Brazil to produce a nearly complete census of arctiines (Noctuoidea: Erebidae), whose species richness was compared using different morphological and molecular approaches (DNA barcoding). A total of 1,075 barcode sequences of 286 morphospecies were analyzed. Based on the clustering method Barcode Index Number (BIN) we found a taxonomic bias of approximately 30% in our initial morphological assessment. However, a morphological reassessment revealed that the correspondence between morphospecies and molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) can be up to 94% if differences in genitalia morphology are evaluated in individuals of different MOTUs originated from the same morphospecies (putative cases of cryptic species), and by recording if individuals of different genders in different morphospecies merge together in the same MOTU (putative cases of sexual dimorphism). The results of two other clustering methods (i.e. Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery and 2% threshold) were very similar to those of the BIN approach. Using empirical data we have shown that DNA barcoding performed substantially better than the morphospecies approach, based on superficial morphology, to delimit species of a highly diverse moth taxon, and thus should be used in species inventories.",10.1371/journal.pone.0148423,DNA barcodes distinguish species of tropical Lepidoptera,"Although central to much biological research, the identification of species is often difficult. The use of DNA barcodes, short DNA sequences from a standardized region of the genome, has recently been proposed as a tool to facilitate species identification and discovery. However, the effectiveness of DNA barcoding for identifying specimens in species-rich tropical biotas is unknown. Here we show that cytochrome
            c
            oxidase I DNA barcodes effectively discriminate among species in three Lepidoptera families from Area de Conservación Guanacaste in northwestern Costa Rica. We found that 97.9% of the 521 species recognized by prior taxonomic work possess distinctive cytochrome
            c
            oxidase I barcodes and that the few instances of interspecific sequence overlap involve very similar species. We also found two or more barcode clusters within each of 13 supposedly single species. Covariation between these clusters and morphological and/or ecological traits indicates overlooked species complexes. If these results are general, DNA barcoding will significantly aid species identification and discovery in tropical settings.",10.1073/pnas.0510466103,Characterization and comparison of poorly known moth communities through DNA barcoding in two Afrotropical environments in Gabon,"Biodiversity research in tropical ecosystems—popularized as the most biodiverse habitats on Earth—often neglects invertebrates, yet invertebrates represent the bulk of local species richness. Insect communities in particular remain strongly impeded by both Linnaean and Wallacean shortfalls, and identifying species often remains a formidable challenge inhibiting the use of these organisms as indicators for ecological and conservation studies. Here we use DNA barcoding as an alternative to the traditional taxonomic approach for characterizing and comparing the diversity of moth communities in two different ecosystems in Gabon. Though sampling remains very incomplete, as evidenced by the high proportion (59%) of species represented by singletons, our results reveal an outstanding diversity. With about 3500 specimens sequenced and representing 1385 BINs (Barcode Index Numbers, used as a proxy to species) in 23 families, the diversity of moths in the two sites sampled is higher than the current number of species listed for the entire country, highlighting the huge gap in biodiversity knowledge for this country. Both seasonal and spatial turnovers are strikingly high (18.3% of BINs shared between seasons, and 13.3% between sites) and draw attention to the need to account for these when running regional surveys. Our results also highlight the richness and singularity of savannah environments and emphasize the status of Central African ecosystems as hotspots of biodiversity.",10.1139/gen-2018-0063,Close congruence between Barcode Index Numbers (bins) and species boundaries in the Erebidae (Lepidoptera: Noctuoidea) of the Iberian Peninsula,"Abstract The DNA barcode reference library for Lepidoptera holds much promise as a tool for taxonomic research and for providing the reliable identifications needed for conservation assessment programs. We gathered sequences for the barcode region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene from 160 of the 176 nominal species of Erebidae moths (Insecta: Lepidoptera) known from the Iberian Peninsula. These results arise from a research project which constructing a DNA barcode library for the insect species of Spain. New records for 271 specimens (122 species) are coupled with preexisting data for 38 species from the Iberian fauna. Mean interspecific distance was 12.1%, while the mean nearest neighbour divergence was 6.4%. All 160 species possessed diagnostic barcode sequences, but one pair of congeneric taxa (Eublemma rosea and Eublemma rietzi) were assigned to the same BIN. As well, intraspecific sequence divergences higher than 1.5% were detected in four species which likely represent species complexes. This study reinforces the effectiveness of DNA barcoding as a tool for monitoring biodiversity in particular geographical areas and the strong correspondence between sequence clusters delineated by BINs and species recognized through detailed taxonomic analysis.",10.3897/bdj.5.e19840,"DNA Barcoding the Geometrid Fauna of Bavaria (Lepidoptera): Successes, Surprises, and Questions","Background The State of Bavaria is involved in a research program that will lead to the construction of a DNA barcode library for all animal species within its territorial boundaries. The present study provides a comprehensive DNA barcode library for the Geometridae, one of the most diverse of insect families. Methodology/Principal Findings This study reports DNA barcodes for 400 Bavarian geometrid species, 98 per cent of the known fauna, and approximately one per cent of all Bavarian animal species. Although 98.5% of these species possess diagnostic barcode sequences in Bavaria, records from neighbouring countries suggest that species-level resolution may be compromised in up to 3.5% of cases. All taxa which apparently share barcodes are discussed in detail. One case of modest divergence (1.4%) revealed a species overlooked by the current taxonomic system: Eupithecia goossensiata Mabille, 1869 stat.n. is raised from synonymy with Eupithecia absinthiata (Clerck, 1759) to species rank. Deep intraspecific sequence divergences (>2%) were detected in 20 traditionally recognized species. Conclusions/Significance The study emphasizes the effectiveness of DNA barcoding as a tool for monitoring biodiversity. Open access is provided to a data set that includes records for 1,395 geometrid specimens (331 species) from Bavaria, with 69 additional species from neighbouring regions. Taxa with deep intraspecific sequence divergences are undergoing more detailed analysis to ascertain if they represent cases of cryptic diversity.",10.1371/journal.pone.0017134,"The methodologies employed across five studies demonstrate the efficacy of DNA barcoding in cataloging biodiversity, particularly in Lepidoptera, by comparing traditional morphological identification with molecular techniques. In the Neotropics, extensive sampling of moths using light traps followed by DNA barcoding revealed a 30% taxonomic bias in morphological assessments, which was reduced to 6% when genitalia morphology was considered, highlighting the importance of detailed morphological examination alongside molecular methods (1). Similarly, in Costa Rica, DNA barcoding of Lepidoptera families showed a 97.9% success rate in species discrimination, with barcode clusters corresponding to morphological or ecological traits, suggesting overlooked species complexes (2). In Gabon, DNA barcoding of moths across two ecosystems uncovered a diversity greater than the known species list for the country, emphasizing the method's potential in revealing hidden biodiversity and the importance of considering seasonal and spatial turnover in surveys (3). In the Iberian Peninsula, DNA barcoding of Erebidae moths achieved species-level resolution with a strong congruence between BINs and species boundaries, although a few cases of shared BINs and intraspecific divergence suggested possible cryptic species (4). Lastly, the comprehensive DNA barcode library for Bavaria's Geometridae revealed a 98.5% success rate in species identification, with deep intraspecific divergences indicating potential cryptic diversity (5). Collectively, these studies underscore DNA barcoding's role in enhancing species inventories, with a need for integrating morphological data to address cases of cryptic species and sexual dimorphism (1, 2, 5).","{

}","The burgeoning field of DNA barcoding has revolutionized biodiversity inventories, particularly in the context of Lepidoptera, by providing a reliable and efficient tool for species identification and discovery in species-rich tropical biotas (2, 3). Studies across various regions, from the Neotropics to the Afrotropical environments of Gabon and the temperate zones of the Iberian Peninsula and Bavaria, have demonstrated the efficacy of DNA barcoding in distinguishing species with high accuracy, often revealing cryptic diversity and overlooked species complexes (1, 4, 5). For instance, in the highly diverse moth taxon of the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, DNA barcoding outperformed traditional morphospecies approaches, uncovering a taxonomic bias of approximately 30% in initial morphological assessments (1). Similarly, in Bavaria, DNA barcoding achieved a 98.5% success rate in providing diagnostic sequences for geometrid species, highlighting its potential for comprehensive biodiversity monitoring (5). The congruence between Barcode Index Numbers (BINs) and species boundaries further underscores the reliability of DNA barcoding, with studies reporting close correspondence between BINs and species recognized through detailed taxonomic analysis (4). However, the presence of shared barcodes among closely related species and the detection of deep intraspecific sequence divergences suggest that DNA barcoding may also prompt taxonomic reevaluation and the discovery of new species (2, 5). These findings collectively emphasize the transformative impact of DNA-based tools on biodiversity inventories, facilitating more nuanced and accurate assessments of species diversity and distribution, which are crucial for conservation and ecological studies (1-5).","{

Similarly, in Costa Rica, DNA barcoding effectively discriminated between 97.9% of Lepidoptera species, uncovering overlooked species complexes and indicating its potential for species identification and discovery in species-rich tropical biotas (2). In Gabon, DNA barcoding characterized moth communities in two ecosystems, revealing a diversity higher than the known species for the entire country and emphasizing the richness of savannah environments as biodiversity hotspots (3). In the Iberian Peninsula, DNA barcoding showed close congruence between Barcode Index Numbers (BINs) and species boundaries in Erebidae moths, reinforcing its effectiveness for biodiversity monitoring in specific geographical areas (4).

Based on the analysis of 69,378 specimens, the library provides coverage for 97.3% of the noctuoid fauna (3565 of 3664 species). In addition to verifying the strong performance of DNA barcodes in the discrimination of these species, the results indicate close congruence between the number of species analyzed (3565) and the number of sequence clusters (3816) recognized by the Barcode Index Number (BIN) system. Distributional patterns across 12 North American ecoregions are examined for the 3251 species that have GPS data while BIN analysis is used to quantify overlap between the noctuoid faunas of North America and other zoogeographic regions. This analysis reveals that 90% of North American noctuoids are endemic and that just 7.5% and 1.8% of BINs are shared with the Neotropics and with the Palearctic, respectively. One third (29) of the latter species are recent introductions and, as expected, they possess low intraspecific divergences.",10.1371/journal.pone.0178548,"A DNA barcode reference library for Swiss butterflies and forester moths as a tool for species identification, systematics and conservation","Butterfly monitoring and Red List programs in Switzerland rely on a combination of observations and collection records to document changes in species distributions through time. While most butterflies can be identified using morphology, some taxa remain challenging, making it difficult to accurately map their distributions and develop appropriate conservation measures. In this paper, we explore the use of the DNA barcode (a fragment of the mitochondrial gene COI) as a tool for the identification of Swiss butterflies and forester moths (Rhopalocera and Zygaenidae). We present a national DNA barcode reference library including 868 sequences representing 217 out of 224 resident species, or 96.9% of Swiss fauna. DNA barcodes were diagnostic for nearly 90% of Swiss species. The remaining 10% represent cases of para- and polyphyly likely involving introgression or incomplete lineage sorting among closely related taxa. We demonstrate that integrative taxonomic methods incorporating a combination of morphological and genetic techniques result in a rate of species identification of over 96% in females and over 98% in males, higher than either morphology or DNA barcodes alone. We explore the use of the DNA barcode for exploring boundaries among taxa, understanding the geographical distribution of cryptic diversity and evaluating the status of purportedly endemic taxa. Finally, we discuss how DNA barcodes may be used to improve field practices and ultimately enhance conservation strategies.",10.1371/journal.pone.0208639,DNA barcode analysis of butterfly species from Pakistan points towards regional endemism,"DNA barcodes were obtained for 81 butterfly species belonging to 52 genera from sites in north‐central Pakistan to test the utility of barcoding for their identification and to gain a better understanding of regional barcode variation. These species represent 25% of the butterfly fauna of Pakistan and belong to five families, although the Nymphalidae were dominant, comprising 38% of the total specimens. Barcode analysis showed that maximum conspecific divergence was 1.6%, while there was 1.7–14.3% divergence from the nearest neighbour species. Barcode records for 55 species showed <2% sequence divergence to records in the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD), but only 26 of these cases involved specimens from neighbouring India and Central Asia. Analysis revealed that most species showed little incremental sequence variation when specimens from other regions were considered, but a threefold increase was noted in a few cases. There was a clear gap between maximum intraspecific and minimum nearest neighbour distance for all 81 species. Neighbour‐joining cluster analysis showed that members of each species formed a monophyletic cluster with strong bootstrap support. The barcode results revealed two provisional species that could not be clearly linked to known taxa, while 24 other species gained their first coverage. Future work should extend the barcode reference library to include all butterfly species from Pakistan as well as neighbouring countries to gain a better understanding of regional variation in barcode sequences in this topographically and climatically complex region.",10.1111/1755-0998.12131,Use of species delimitation approaches to tackle the cryptic diversity of an assemblage of high Andean butterflies (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea),"Cryptic biological diversity has generated ambiguity in taxonomic and evolutionary studies. Single-locus methods and other approaches for species delimitation are useful for addressing this challenge, enabling the practical processing of large numbers of samples for identification and inventory purposes. This study analyzed an assemblage of high Andean butterflies using DNA barcoding and compared the identifications based on the current morphological taxonomy with three methods of species delimitation (automatic barcode gap discovery, generalized mixed Yule coalescent model, and Poisson tree processes). Sixteen potential cryptic species were recognized using these three methods, representing a net richness increase of 11.3% in the assemblage. A well-studied taxon of the genus Vanessa, which has a wide geographical distribution, appeared with the potential cryptic species that had a higher genetic differentiation at the local level than at the continental level. The analyses were useful for identifying the potential cryptic species in Pedaliodes and Forsterinaria complexes, which also show differentiation along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients. This genetic assessment of an entire assemblage of high Andean butterflies (Papilionoidea) provides baseline information for future research in a region characterized by high rates of endemism and population isolation.",10.1139/gen-2020-0100,Fast Census of Moth Diversity in the Neotropics: A Comparison of Field-Assigned Morphospecies and DNA Barcoding in Tiger Moths,"The morphological species delimitations (i.e. morphospecies) have long been the best way to avoid the taxonomic impediment and compare insect taxa biodiversity in highly diverse tropical and subtropical regions. The development of DNA barcoding, however, has shown great potential to replace (or at least complement) the morphospecies approach, with the advantage of relying on automated methods implemented in computer programs or even online rather than in often subjective morphological features. We sampled moths extensively for two years using light traps in a patch of the highly endangered Atlantic Forest of Brazil to produce a nearly complete census of arctiines (Noctuoidea: Erebidae), whose species richness was compared using different morphological and molecular approaches (DNA barcoding). A total of 1,075 barcode sequences of 286 morphospecies were analyzed. Based on the clustering method Barcode Index Number (BIN) we found a taxonomic bias of approximately 30% in our initial morphological assessment. However, a morphological reassessment revealed that the correspondence between morphospecies and molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) can be up to 94% if differences in genitalia morphology are evaluated in individuals of different MOTUs originated from the same morphospecies (putative cases of cryptic species), and by recording if individuals of different genders in different morphospecies merge together in the same MOTU (putative cases of sexual dimorphism). The results of two other clustering methods (i.e. Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery and 2% threshold) were very similar to those of the BIN approach. Using empirical data we have shown that DNA barcoding performed substantially better than the morphospecies approach, based on superficial morphology, to delimit species of a highly diverse moth taxon, and thus should be used in species inventories.",10.1371/journal.pone.0148423,"The methodologies employed across five studies demonstrate the efficacy of DNA barcoding in cataloging biodiversity, particularly within Lepidoptera. The assembly of a comprehensive DNA barcode reference library was central to these efforts, as seen in the Noctuoidea of North America (1) and Swiss butterflies and forester moths (2), achieving coverage for 97.3% and 96.9% of the respective faunas. These libraries facilitated species discrimination and the exploration of distributional patterns, with the BIN system proving instrumental in identifying species clusters and regional endemism (1, 3). In Pakistan, barcode analysis not only confirmed species identities but also highlighted regional barcode variation and potential new species, underscoring the importance of expanding reference libraries to encompass regional diversity (3). Species delimitation methods, such as the automatic barcode gap discovery, generalized mixed Yule coalescent model, and Poisson tree processes, were effectively used to uncover cryptic species in high Andean butterflies, revealing a richness increase of 11.3% and suggesting local genetic differentiation (4). In the Neotropics, DNA barcoding outperformed morphospecies approaches, with a reassessment of genitalia morphology and sexual dimorphism increasing the correspondence between morphospecies and molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) to 94%, highlighting the potential for DNA barcoding to refine species inventories (5). Collectively, these studies illustrate the transformative impact of DNA-based tools in biodiversity inventories, offering a more precise and comprehensive understanding of species diversity and distribution.","{

}","The burgeoning field of DNA barcoding has significantly advanced the inventory and understanding of biodiversity, particularly in the realm of Lepidoptera, as evidenced by recent studies across various regions and taxa. DNA barcoding has proven to be a robust tool for species identification, revealing a high congruence between morphologically identified species and sequence clusters, as demonstrated in North American noctuoids (1) and Swiss butterflies (2). This molecular approach has not only facilitated the detection of cryptic species and the assessment of regional endemism in butterflies from Pakistan (3) and high Andean butterflies (4), but it has also challenged traditional morphological methods by uncovering taxonomic biases and improving species delimitation in Neotropical moths (5). The integration of DNA barcoding with morphological and genetic techniques has resulted in enhanced species identification rates, surpassing those achieved by either method alone (2). Furthermore, DNA barcoding has been instrumental in uncovering the geographical distribution of cryptic diversity and aiding in conservation strategies by providing more accurate species distributions (2, 4). The studies collectively underscore the importance of DNA-based tools in addressing the taxonomic impediment, refining our understanding of species boundaries, and informing biodiversity conservation efforts (1-5).","{

Abstract:
Butterflies (Lepidoptera) are one of the most diverse and iconic insect groups, with over 20,000 described species. However, their taxonomic inventory is far from complete, especially in regions with complex topography and high biodiversity. DNA barcoding has emerged as a powerful tool for identifying and delimiting butterfly species, complementing traditional morphological approaches. In this review, we discuss recent advances in butterfly taxonomy using DNA barcoding, focusing on two case studies: Pakistan and the Neotropics.

In Pakistan, a comprehensive study of the butterfly fauna used DNA barcoding to identify 81 species from five families, revealing significant intraspecific and interspecific genetic divergence. The results showed that most species had little incremental sequence variation when specimens from other regions were considered, but a threefold increase was noted in a few cases. This study highlighted the importance of expanding the barcode reference library to include all butterfly species from Pakistan and neighboring countries for a better understanding of regional variation in barcode sequences.

In the Neotropics, a study on high Andean butterflies (Papilionoidea) used DNA barcoding and three methods of species delimitation to identify potential cryptic species. The results revealed 16 potential cryptic species, representing a net richness increase of 11.3% in the assemblage. This study demonstrated that DNA barcoding is an effective tool for identifying cryptic diversity in butterflies and can be used to complement traditional morphological approaches.

Conclusion:
DNA barcoding has proven to be a valuable tool for advancing butterfly taxonomy, particularly in regions with complex biodiversity and high endemism. The case studies presented here demonstrate the utility of DNA barcoding for identifying cryptic species and expanding our understanding of butterfly diversity. However, it is important to continue expanding the barcode reference library and refining methods for species delimitation to ensure accurate and comprehensive assessments of butterfly biodiversity.

The results showed that most species had little incremental sequence variation when specimens from other regions were considered, but a threefold increase was noted in a few cases. Neighbor-joining cluster analysis supported the monophyly of each species with strong bootstrap support. Two provisional species could not be clearly linked to known taxa, while 24 other species gained their first coverage.

In the Neotropics, a study of high Andean butterflies (Papilionoidea) using DNA barcoding and three methods for species delimitation identified 16 potential cryptic species, representing a net richness increase of 11.3%. The results were particularly useful for identifying the potential cryptic species in Pedaliodes and Forsterinaria complexes, which also show differentiation along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients.

These studies demonstrate the utility of DNA barcoding for butterfly taxonomy, enabling the practical processing of large numbers of samples for identification and inventory purposes. Future work should extend the barcode reference library to include all butterfly species from Pakistan and neighboring countries to gain a better understanding of regional variation in barcode sequences. Similarly, expanding the barcode database for Neotropical butterflies will provide baseline information for future research in a region characterized by high rates of endemism and population isolation.

Here, we assemble the first high-resolution reference library for European butterflies that provides 97% taxon coverage (459 species) and 22,306 COI sequences. We estimate that we captured 62% of the total haplotype diversity and show that most species possess a few very common haplotypes and many rare ones. Specimens in the dataset have an average 95.3% probability of being correctly identified. Mitochondrial diversity displayed elevated haplotype richness in southern European refugia, establishing the generality of this key biogeographic pattern for an entire taxonomic group. Fifteen percent of the species are involved in barcode sharing, but two thirds of these cases may reflect the need for further taxonomic research. This dataset provides a unique resource for conservation and for studying evolutionary processes, cryptic species, phylogeography, and ecology.",10.1038/s42003-021-01834-7,"A DNA barcode reference library for Swiss butterflies and forester moths as a tool for species identification, systematics and conservation","Butterfly monitoring and Red List programs in Switzerland rely on a combination of observations and collection records to document changes in species distributions through time. While most butterflies can be identified using morphology, some taxa remain challenging, making it difficult to accurately map their distributions and develop appropriate conservation measures. In this paper, we explore the use of the DNA barcode (a fragment of the mitochondrial gene COI) as a tool for the identification of Swiss butterflies and forester moths (Rhopalocera and Zygaenidae). We present a national DNA barcode reference library including 868 sequences representing 217 out of 224 resident species, or 96.9% of Swiss fauna. DNA barcodes were diagnostic for nearly 90% of Swiss species. The remaining 10% represent cases of para- and polyphyly likely involving introgression or incomplete lineage sorting among closely related taxa. We demonstrate that integrative taxonomic methods incorporating a combination of morphological and genetic techniques result in a rate of species identification of over 96% in females and over 98% in males, higher than either morphology or DNA barcodes alone. We explore the use of the DNA barcode for exploring boundaries among taxa, understanding the geographical distribution of cryptic diversity and evaluating the status of purportedly endemic taxa. Finally, we discuss how DNA barcodes may be used to improve field practices and ultimately enhance conservation strategies.",10.1371/journal.pone.0208639,Species-Level Para- and Polyphyly in DNA Barcode Gene Trees: Strong Operational Bias in European Lepidoptera,"The proliferation of DNA data is revolutionizing all fields of systematic research. DNA barcode sequences, now available for millions of specimens and several hundred thousand species, are increasingly used in algorithmic species delimitations. This is complicated by occasional incongruences between species and gene genealogies, as indicated by situations where conspecific individuals do not form a monophyletic cluster in a gene tree. In two previous reviews, non-monophyly has been reported as being common in mitochondrial DNA gene trees. We developed a novel web service “Monophylizer” to detect non-monophyly in phylogenetic trees and used it to ascertain the incidence of species non-monophyly in COI (a.k.a. cox1) barcode sequence data from 4977 species and 41,583 specimens of European Lepidoptera, the largest data set of DNA barcodes analyzed from this regard. Particular attention was paid to accurate species identification to ensure data integrity. We investigated the effects of tree-building method, sampling effort, and other methodological issues, all of which can influence estimates of non-monophyly. We found a 12% incidence of non-monophyly, a value significantly lower than that observed in previous studies. Neighbor joining (NJ) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods yielded almost equal numbers of non-monophyletic species, but 24.1% of these cases of non-monophyly were only found by one of these methods. Non-monophyletic species tend to show either low genetic distances to their nearest neighbors or exceptionally high levels of intraspecific variability. Cases of polyphyly in COI trees arising as a result of deep intraspecific divergence are negligible, as the detected cases reflected misidentifications or methodological errors. Taking into consideration variation in sampling effort, we estimate that the true incidence of non-monophyly is ∼23%, but with operational factors still being included. Within the operational factors, we separately assessed the frequency of taxonomic limitations (presence of overlooked cryptic and oversplit species) and identification uncertainties. We observed that operational factors are potentially present in more than half (58.6%) of the detected cases of non-monophyly. Furthermore, we observed that in about 20% of non-monophyletic species and entangled species, the lineages involved are either allopatric or parapatric—conditions where species delimitation is inherently subjective and particularly dependent on the species concept that has been adopted. These observations suggest that species-level non-monophyly in COI gene trees is less common than previously supposed, with many cases reflecting misidentifications, the subjectivity of species delimitation or other operational factors.",10.1093/sysbio/syw044,Use of species delimitation approaches to tackle the cryptic diversity of an assemblage of high Andean butterflies (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea),"Cryptic biological diversity has generated ambiguity in taxonomic and evolutionary studies. Single-locus methods and other approaches for species delimitation are useful for addressing this challenge, enabling the practical processing of large numbers of samples for identification and inventory purposes. This study analyzed an assemblage of high Andean butterflies using DNA barcoding and compared the identifications based on the current morphological taxonomy with three methods of species delimitation (automatic barcode gap discovery, generalized mixed Yule coalescent model, and Poisson tree processes). Sixteen potential cryptic species were recognized using these three methods, representing a net richness increase of 11.3% in the assemblage. A well-studied taxon of the genus Vanessa, which has a wide geographical distribution, appeared with the potential cryptic species that had a higher genetic differentiation at the local level than at the continental level. The analyses were useful for identifying the potential cryptic species in Pedaliodes and Forsterinaria complexes, which also show differentiation along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients. This genetic assessment of an entire assemblage of high Andean butterflies (Papilionoidea) provides baseline information for future research in a region characterized by high rates of endemism and population isolation.",10.1139/gen-2020-0100,Complete DNA barcode reference library for a country's butterfly fauna reveals high performance for temperate Europe,"DNA barcoding aims to accelerate species identification and discovery, but performance tests have shown marked differences in identification success. As a consequence, there remains a great need for comprehensive studies which objectively test the method in groups with a solid taxonomic framework. This study focuses on the 180 species of butterflies in Romania, accounting for about one third of the European butterfly fauna. This country includes five eco-regions, the highest of any in the European Union, and is a good representative for temperate areas. Morphology and DNA barcodes of more than 1300 specimens were carefully studied and compared. Our results indicate that 90 per cent of the species form barcode clusters allowing their reliable identification. The remaining cases involve nine closely related species pairs, some whose taxonomic status is controversial or that hybridize regularly. Interestingly, DNA barcoding was found to be the most effective identification tool, outperforming external morphology, and being slightly better than male genitalia. Romania is now the first country to have a comprehensive DNA barcode reference database for butterflies. Similar barcoding efforts based on comprehensive sampling of specific geographical regions can act as functional modules that will foster the early application of DNA barcoding while a global system is under development.",10.1098/rspb.2010.1089,"The methodologies employed across these studies demonstrate the power of DNA barcoding and species delimitation approaches in unraveling the complexity of butterfly biodiversity. The construction of high-resolution DNA barcode libraries, as seen in the European butterfly study (1), provides a foundational reference for identifying species and understanding mitochondrial genetic diversity patterns. Similarly, the Swiss butterfly and forester moth research (2) underscores the utility of DNA barcodes in species identification, systematics, and conservation, particularly when integrated with morphological data to achieve higher identification accuracy. The use of a novel web service, ""Monophylizer,"" in the European Lepidoptera study (3), highlights the importance of accurate species identification and the influence of methodological factors on non-monophyly detection in gene trees. In the high Andean butterfly assemblage (4), species delimitation methods such as automatic barcode gap discovery, generalized mixed Yule coalescent model, and Poisson tree processes were instrumental in detecting cryptic species, emphasizing the role of genetic differentiation across geographical gradients. Lastly, the comprehensive DNA barcode reference library for Romania's butterfly fauna (5) showcases the effectiveness of DNA barcoding over traditional morphological methods, setting a precedent for regional biodiversity inventories. Collectively, these methodologies contribute significantly to the research problem of biodiversity inventories by enhancing species resolution and facilitating the detection of cryptic diversity (1-5).","{

}","The advent of DNA barcoding has significantly advanced the inventory and understanding of biodiversity, particularly in European butterflies, where comprehensive DNA barcode libraries have been established to facilitate species identification and conservation efforts (1, 2, 5). These libraries have revealed patterns of mitochondrial genetic diversity, with a high haplotype richness in southern European refugia and a notable proportion of species exhibiting barcode sharing, which may indicate the need for further taxonomic research (1). In Switzerland, DNA barcodes have proven diagnostic for nearly 90% of species, enhancing the accuracy of species distribution mapping and informing conservation strategies (2). However, species-level para- and polyphyly in DNA barcode gene trees present challenges, with operational biases such as misidentifications and methodological errors accounting for a significant portion of non-monophyly cases (3). Despite these issues, DNA barcoding has been instrumental in uncovering cryptic species diversity, as demonstrated in high Andean butterflies, where species delimitation approaches identified potential cryptic species with local genetic differentiation (4). Overall, DNA barcoding has emerged as a highly effective tool for species identification, outperforming traditional morphological methods and enabling the construction of reference libraries that are crucial for biodiversity assessments and the development of conservation measures (5).","{

Abstract:
DNA barcoding, the standardized use of a short DNA sequence as a unique identifier for species, has gained increasing popularity due to its potential to accelerate taxonomic workflows and facilitate biodiversity assessments. This review focuses on recent advances in DNA barcoding and its applications to Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), one of the most diverse insect orders. We begin by discussing methodological improvements, including the use of next-generation sequencing technologies and the development of new software tools for sequence alignment and tree reconstruction. Next, we discuss the challenges associated with DNA barcoding in Lepidoptera, such as high intraspecific variation, non-monophyly, and cryptic species. We also explore the potential applications of DNA barcoding to various aspects of Lepidopteran research, including species identification, population genetics, phylogenetics, and biodiversity assessments. Finally, we highlight some recent studies that have employed DNA barcoding in Lepidoptera for practical purposes, such as the detection of invasive species, the monitoring of endangered taxa, and the assessment of biodiversity hotspots.

Introduction:
DNA barcoding is a molecular method for identifying organisms based on their unique DNA sequences. The most commonly used DNA barcode region is the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene, which has been shown to be effective in distinguishing most animal species. However, the application of DNA barcoding to Lepidoptera, one of the most diverse insect orders, presents several challenges due to their high intraspecific variation, non-monophyly, and cryptic species. In this review, we discuss recent advances in DNA barcoding methodology and its applications to Lepidoptera research.

Methodological Advances:
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized DNA barcoding by enabling the simultaneous sequencing of multiple samples at a much lower cost than traditional Sanger sequencing. This has led to the development of large-scale DNA barcode libraries, such as the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD), which currently contains over 1 million barcode sequences from more than 200,000 species. Additionally, new software tools have been developed for sequence alignment and tree reconstruction, such as the Barcode Workbench and the RAxML-NGS pipeline.

Challenges in Lepidoptera DNA Barcoding:
Despite its potential benefits, DNA barcoding in Lepidoptera faces several challenges. First, Lepidoptera exhibit high intraspecific variation, which can make it difficult to distinguish between closely related species based on their COI sequences alone. Second, non-monophyly is common in Lepidopteran COI trees due to incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization events. Third, cryptic species are often overlooked in traditional taxonomic studies but can be detected using DNA barcoding.

Applications of DNA Barcoding in Lepidoptera:
Despite these challenges, DNA barcoding has numerous applications in Lepidoptera research. For example, it can be used for species identification, population genetics, phylogenetics, and biodiversity assessments. In the context of invasive species detection, DNA barcoding has been shown to be effective in distinguishing between native and introduced populations of Lepidoptera. In the context of endangered taxa monitoring, DNA barcoding can help identify individuals belonging to threatened species and monitor their population dynamics. Finally, DNA barcoding can be used to assess biodiversity hotspots by providing a rapid and cost-effective method for identifying and cataloging Lepidopteran species.

Conclusion:
DNA barcoding has become an essential tool in taxonomy, ecology, conservation, and many other fields. The advances discussed herein will continue to shape the future of this powerful molecular identification system.","{

Abstract:
DNA barcoding, the standardized use of a short DNA sequence for species identification, has gained increasing attention as a powerful tool for biodiversity research. This review focuses on recent advances in DNA barcoding and its application to Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), one of the most diverse insect groups. We begin by discussing methodological improvements in DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequence alignment, which have led to more accurate and reliable barcode data. Next, we discuss the use of DNA barcoding for taxonomic challenges, such as species delimitation and identification of cryptic species. We also explore its application to biodiversity assessments, including studies on species richness, phylogenetic relationships, and population genetics. Furthermore, we examine the potential of DNA barcoding for monitoring changes in biodiversity over time and space, as well as its use in forensic entomology and biosecurity applications. Finally, we discuss the challenges and limitations of DNA barcoding, including issues related to data quality, taxonomic coverage, and the need for standardized protocols and databases.

1. Improvements in DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequence alignment methods for accurate DNA barcode data
The development of improved DNA extraction methods, such as silica-based spin columns and automated extraction systems, has led to more consistent and reliable DNA yields. Advances in PCR technology, including the use of hot start polymerases and optimized cycling conditions, have increased the success rate of amplification for difficult barcode regions. Additionally, improvements in sequence alignment algorithms, such as MAFFT and Clustal Omega, have facilitated more accurate and reliable sequence comparisons.

2. DNA barcoding for taxonomic challenges: species delimitation and identification of cryptic species
DNA barcoding has been used to address taxonomic challenges related to species delimitation and the discovery of cryptic species. For example, in Lepidoptera, studies have revealed numerous cases of cryptic species complexes, which were previously considered a single morphospecies. These discoveries have led to revisions of taxonomic classifications and the description of new species.

3. DNA barcoding for biodiversity assessments: species richness, phylogenetic relationships, and population genetics
DNA barcoding has been used extensively in biodiversity assessments to study species richness, phylogenetic relationships, and population genetics in Lepidoptera. For example, studies have revealed high levels of endemism and diversity in specific regions, such as the Mediterranean and the Andes. Additionally, DNA barcoding has been used to investigate population genetic structure and gene flow among populations, providing insights into the evolutionary history and conservation status of various species.

4. Applications of DNA barcoding: monitoring changes in biodiversity over time and space, forensic entomology, and biosecurity
DNA barcoding has potential applications in various fields beyond taxonomy and biodiversity research. For example, it can be used for monitoring changes in biodiversity over time and space, such as tracking the spread of invasive species or assessing the impact of climate change on biodiversity. In forensic entomology, DNA barcoding has been used to identify insects from decomposing remains, providing valuable information for estimating post-mortem intervals and determining cause of death. Additionally, DNA barcoding can be used in biosecurity applications, such as identifying smuggled or illegally traded species, and monitoring the spread of diseases among wildlife populations.

5. Challenges and limitations of DNA barcoding: data quality, taxonomic coverage, and the need for standardized protocols and databases
Despite its numerous benefits, DNA barcoding also faces several challenges and limitations. For instance, the accuracy and reliability of DNA barcode data depend on factors such as sample size, quality, and representation. Additionally, taxonomic coverage remains incomplete for many species, particularly those with limited morphological information or complex life histories. Furthermore, standardized protocols and databases are essential for ensuring consistent and reliable DNA barcode data across various applications and research domains.

Conclusion:
DNA barcoding has emerged as a powerful tool for advancing taxonomic knowledge, biodiversity assessments, and applied research in various fields. Its continued development and refinement will lead to more accurate, reliable, and comprehensive data, enabling deeper insights into the natural world and its challenges.","{

Introduction:
DNA barcoding is a molecular method for species identification based on the sequencing and comparison of a standardized DNA region, typically the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. The use of DNA barcodes has gained increasing popularity due to their potential to accelerate taxonomic workflows, facilitate biodiversity assessments, and provide a standardized tool for identifying species in various fields such as ecology, conservation biology, forensics, and agriculture. However, the application of DNA barcoding to Lepidoptera, one of the most diverse insect orders, has faced several challenges due to the high intraspecific variation, non-monophyly, and cryptic species present in this group. In this review, we discuss recent advances in DNA barcoding methodologies and their applications to Lepidoptera research.

Methodological Advancements:
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized DNA barcoding by enabling the simultaneous sequencing of multiple samples at a much lower cost than traditional Sanger sequencing. This has led to the development of large-scale DNA barcode libraries, such as the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD), which currently contains over 1 million barcode sequences from more than 200,000 species. Additionally, new software tools have been developed for sequence alignment and tree reconstruction, such as the Barcode Workbench, which can handle large datasets and provide accurate results even in the presence of high intraspecific variation.

Challenges in Lepidoptera:
Despite these methodological advancements, DNA barcoding faces several challenges when applied to Lepidoptera. One challenge is the high intraspecific variation present in this group, which can result in overlapping barcode clusters and misidentifications. Another challenge is non-monophyly, where species do not form monophyletic groups in DNA trees due to hybridization or incomplete lineage sorting. Finally, cryptic species, which are morphologically indistinguishable but genetically distinct, can also pose a challenge for DNA barcoding.

Applications of DNA Barcoding in Lepidoptera:
Despite these challenges, DNA barcoding has proven to be a valuable tool for various applications in Lepidoptera research. For example, it has been used to monitor invasive species, such as the Wandering Tiger Moth (Araschnia levana), which can cause significant damage to crops and forests. It has also been used to identify misidentifications in museum collections, such as the mistaken identification of the Common Swift moth (Hepialus humuli) as the European Corn Borer (Ostrinia nubilalis). Additionally, DNA barcoding has been used to assess the diversity of butterflies in Europe, which is important for conservation efforts and biodiversity monitoring.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, DNA barcoding has come a long way since its inception and has proven to be a valuable tool for various applications in Lepidoptera research. Despite the challenges present in this group, methodological advancements and new software tools have enabled accurate and reliable identification of species even in the presence of high intraspecific variation, non-monophyly, and cryptic species. The development of large-scale DNA barcode libraries, such as BOLD, has facilitated the early application of DNA barcoding while a global system is under development. Future research will focus on improving the accuracy and reliability of DNA barcoding in Lepidoptera, as well as exploring its potential applications to other areas of research, such as population genetics and phylogenetics.","{

1192,Mechanical Process Engineering,Chemistry,Application and forming of hard material coatings ,Investigations on Tailored Forming of AISI 52100 as Rolling Bearing Raceway,"Hybrid cylindrical roller thrust bearing washers of type 81212 were manufactured by tailored forming. An AISI 1022M base material, featuring a sufficient strength for structural loads, was cladded with the bearing steel AISI 52100 by plasma transferred arc welding (PTA). Though AISI 52100 is generally regarded as non-weldable, it could be applied as a cladding material by adjusting PTA parameters. The cladded parts were investigated after each individual process step and subsequently tested under rolling contact load. Welding defects that could not be completely eliminated by the subsequent hot forming were characterized by means of scanning acoustic microscopy and micrographs. Below the surface, pores with a typical size of ten µm were found to a depth of about 0.45 mm. In the material transition zone and between individual weld seams, larger voids were observed. Grinding of the surface after heat treatment caused compressive residual stresses near the surface with a relatively small depth. Fatigue tests were carried out on an FE8 test rig. Eighty-two percent of the calculated rating life for conventional bearings was achieved. A high failure slope of the Weibull regression was determined. A relationship between the weld defects and the fatigue behavior is likely.",10.3390/met10101363,Manufacturing and Evaluation of Multi-Material Axial-Bearing Washers by Tailored Forming,"Components subject to rolling contact fatigue, such as gears and rolling bearings, are among the fundamental machine elements in mechanical and vehicle engineering. Rolling bearings are generally not designed to be fatigue-resistant, as the necessary oversizing is not technically and economically marketable. In order to improve the load-bearing capacity, resource efficiency and application possibilities of rolling bearings and other possible multi-material solid components, a new process chain was developed at Leibniz University Hannover as a part of the Collaborative Research Centre 1153 “Tailored Forming”. Semi-finished products, already joined before the forming process, are used here to allow a further optimisation of joint quality by forming and finishing. In this paper, a plasma-powder-deposition welding process is presented, which enables precise material deposition and control of the welding depth. For this study, bearing washers (serving as rolling bearing raceways) of a cylindrical roller thrust bearing, similar to type 81212 with a multi-layer structure, were manufactured. A previously non-weldable high-performance material, steel AISI 5140, was used as the cladding layer. Depending on the degree of forming, grain-refinement within the welded material was achieved by thermo-mechanical treatment of the joining zone during the forming process. This grain-refinements lead to an improvement of the mechanical properties and thus, to a higher lifetime for washers of an axial cylindrical roller bearing, which were examined as an exemplary component on a fatigue test bench. To evaluate the bearing washers, the results of the bearing tests were compared with industrial bearings and deposition welded axial-bearing washers without subsequent forming. In addition, the bearing washers were analysed micro-tribologically and by scanning acoustic microscopy both after welding and after the forming process. Nano-scratch tests were carried out on the bearing washers to analyse the layer properties. Together with the results of additional microscopic images of the surface and cross-sections, the causes of failure due to fatigue and wear were identified.",10.3390/met9020232,Cross-wedge rolling of PTA-welded hybrid steel billets with rolling bearing steel and hard material coatings,"Within the Collaborative Research Centre 1153 “Tailored Forming“ a process chain for the manufacturing of hybrid high performance components is developed. Exemplary process steps consist of deposit welding of high performance steel on low-cost steel, pre-shaping by cross-wedge rolling and finishing by milling.Hard material coatings such as Stellite 6 or Delcrome 253 are used as wear or corrosion protection coatings in industrial applications. Scientists of the Institute of Material Science welded these hard material alloys onto a base material, in this case C22.8, to create a hybrid workpiece. Scientists of the Institut fur Integrierte Produktion Hannover have shown that these hybrid workpieces can be formed without defects (e.g. detachment of the coating) by cross-wedge rolling. After forming, the properties of the coatings are retained or in some cases even improved (e.g. the transition zone between base material and coating). By adjustments in the welding process, it was possible to apply the 100Cr6 rolling bearing steel, as of now declared as non-weldable, on the low-cost steel C22.8. 100Cr6 was formed afterwards in its hybrid bonding state with C22.8 by cross-wedge rolling, thus a component-integrated bearing seat was produced. Even after welding and forming, the rolling bearing steel coating could still be quench-hardened to a hardness of over 60 HRC. This paper shows the potential of forming hybrid billets to tailored parts. Since industrially available standard materials can be used for hard material coatings by this approach, even though they are not weldable by conventional methods, it is not necessary to use expensive, for welding designed materials to implement a hybrid component concept.Within the Collaborative Research Centre 1153 “Tailored Forming“ a process chain for the manufacturing of hybrid high performance components is developed.

In this way, components can be produced with materials adapted to the load case. For this paper, hybrid shafts are produced by deposition welding of a cladding made of X45CrSi9-3 onto a workpiece made from 20MnCr5. The hybrid shafts are then formed by means of cross-wedge rolling. It is investigated, how the thickness of the cladding and the type of cooling after hot forming (in air or in water) affect the properties of the cladding. The hybrid shafts are formed without layer separation. However, slight core loosening occurres in the area of the bearing seat due to the Mannesmann effect. The microhardness of the cladding is only slightly effected by the cooling strategy, while the microhardness of the base material is significantly higher in water cooled shafts. The microstructure of the cladding after both cooling strategies consists mainly of martensite. In the base material, air cooling results in a mainly ferritic microstructure with grains of ferrite-pearlite. Quenching in water results in a microstructure containing mainly martensite.",10.1007/s11740-022-01119-w,Tribological Study on Tailored-Formed Axial Bearing Washers,"To enhance tribological contacts under cyclic load, high performance materials are required. Utilizing the same high-strength material for the whole machine element is not resource-efficient. In order to manufacture machine elements with extended functionality and specific properties, a combination of different materials can be used in a single component for a more efficient material utilization. By combining different joining techniques with subsequent forming, multi-material or tailored components can be manufactured. To reduce material costs and energy consumption during the component service life, a less expensive lightweight material should be used for regions remote from the highly stressed zones. The scope is not only to obtain the desired shape and dimensions for the finishing process, but also to improve properties like the bond strength between different materials and the microscopic structure of the material. The multi-material approach can be applied to all components requiring different properties in separate component regions such as shafts, bearings or bushes. The current study exemplarily presents the process route for the production of an axial bearing washer by means of tailored forming technology. The bearing washers were chosen to fit axial roller bearings (type 81212). The manufacturing process starts with the laser wire cladding of a hard facing made of martensitic chromium silicon steel (1.4718) on a base substrate of S235 (1.0038) steel. Subsequently, the bearing washers are forged. After finishing, the surfaces of the bearing washers were tested in thrust bearings on an FE-8 test rig. The operational test of the bearings consists in a run-in phase at 250 rpm. A bearing failure is determined by a condition monitoring system. Before and after this, the bearings were inspected by optical and ultrasonic microscopy in order to examine whether the bond of the coat is resistant against rolling contact fatigue.

Similarly, the second paper utilized plasma-powder-deposition welding for cladding AISI 5140 steel, with subsequent forming leading to grain refinement and improved mechanical properties, assessed through fatigue testing and micro-tribological analysis (2). The third study explored cross-wedge rolling of PTA-welded hybrid steel billets, combining hard material coatings with base materials, and demonstrated the retention or enhancement of coating properties post-forming (3).

Tailored Forming, a process chain involving deposition welding, hot forming, and finishing, has been pivotal in achieving these improvements. By depositing high-performance materials like AISI 52100 and AISI 5140 onto less expensive substrates, researchers have successfully manufactured components with improved load-bearing capacities and extended lifetimes (1, 2). Notably, even materials previously considered non-weldable have been successfully cladded and formed without defects, such as detachment of the coating, and have retained or even improved their properties post-formation (3). The application of hard material coatings like Stellite 6 and Delcrome 253 has been shown to be feasible on standard materials, bypassing the need for expensive, weldable alternatives (3). Furthermore, the microstructural integrity of these coatings, such as grain refinement and martensitic transformations, has been maintained or enhanced through thermo-mechanical treatments and cooling strategies, contributing to the overall mechanical performance of the components (2, 4). Tribological studies have also confirmed the bond strength and fatigue resistance of these multi-material components, validating the tailored forming approach for producing efficient and resource-saving machine elements (5).","{

Abstract:
Tailored forming is a process chain for the manufacturing of hybrid high performance components. It consists of joining processes or Additive Manufacturing for various materials (e.g., deposition welding), subsequent hot forming, machining, and heat treatment. This approach enables the production of components with materials adapted to specific load cases, improving material utilization and reducing energy consumption during service life. In this paper, we present the manufacturing process of hybrid shafts and bearings using tailored forming technology. The hybrid shafts are produced by deposition welding a cladding made of X45CrSi9-3 onto a workpiece made from 20MnCr5. The hybrid shafts are then formed by means of cross-wedge rolling. We investigate the effect of cladding thickness and cooling strategy (air or water) on the properties of the cladding, including bond strength, microhardness, and microstructure. The results demonstrate that the hybrid shafts can be formed without layer separation, but slight core loosening occurs in the bearing seat area due to the Mannesmann effect. The microhardness of the cladding is only slightly affected by the cooling strategy, while the microhardness of the base material is significantly higher in water-cooled shafts. The microstructure of the cladding after both cooling strategies consists mainly of martensite, while the base material exhibits a ferritic microstructure with grains of ferrite-pearlite for air cooling and a microstructure containing mainly martensite for water cooling.

The manufacturing process continues with the production of axial bearing washers using the same tailored forming approach. The bearing washers are chosen to fit axial roller bearings (type 81212). The hybrid bearing washers are produced by laser wire cladding a hard facing made of martensitic chromium silicon steel (1.4718) on a base substrate of S235 (1.0038) steel. Subsequently, the bearing washers are forged. The surfaces of the bearing washers are tested in thrust bearings on an FE-8 test rig. Operational tests consist of a run-in phase at 250 rpm and a condition monitoring system to determine bearing failure. Before and after these tests, the bearings were inspected using optical and ultrasonic microscopy to examine whether the bond between different materials is resistant against rolling contact fatigue. The results demonstrate that the joining zone was able to withstand the rolling contact stresses and the bearing failed due to material-induced fatigue with high cycle stability.

Abstract:
Tailored forming is a process chain for manufacturing hybrid components by combining various materials in a single component to optimize material utilization and improve properties. This approach can be applied to all machine elements requiring different properties in separate regions such as shafts, bearings, or bushes. The current study presents the process route for the production of an axial bearing washer using tailored forming technology. The manufacturing process starts with the laser wire cladding of a hard facing made of martensitic chromium silicon steel (1.4718) on a base substrate of S235 (1.0038) steel. Subsequently, the bearing washers are forged. After finishing, the surfaces of the bearing washers were tested in thrust bearings on an FE-8 test rig to evaluate their tribological performance under cyclic loading. The operational test consists of a run-in phase at 250 rpm, followed by inspection using optical and ultrasonic microscopy to examine the bond strength between different materials and the microstructure of the material. The feasibility of the approach was proven through endurance testing, as the joining zone withstood rolling contact stresses and the bearing failed due to material-induced fatigue with high cycle stability.

1. Development of a process chain for the manufacturing of hybrid components using tailored forming technology
The Tailored Forming process chain is used to manufacture hybrid components by combining various materials in a single component to optimize material utilization and improve properties. The process consists of joining processes or Additive Manufacturing, subsequent hot forming, machining, and heat treatment. In this study, the manufacturing process starts with the laser wire cladding of a hard facing made of martensitic chromium silicon steel (1.4718) on a base substrate of S235 (1.0038) steel to produce hybrid bearing washers. The hybrid bearing washers are then formed by means of cross-wedge rolling.

2. Microstructural analysis and mechanical properties of PTA-welded hybrid steel billets with bearing steel and hard material coatings
The scope is not only to obtain the desired shape and dimensions for the finishing process but also to improve properties like bond strength between different materials and microstructure of the material. The multi-material approach can be applied to all components requiring different properties in separate component regions such as shafts, bearings, or bushes. This section discusses the microstructural analysis and mechanical properties of PTA-welded hybrid steel billets with bearing steel and hard material coatings.

3. Development and characterization of a process for manufacturing tailored axial bearing washers using laser wire cladding and cross-wedge rolling
This section focuses on the development and characterization of a process for manufacturing tailored axial bearing washers using laser wire cladding and cross-wedge rolling. The manufacturing process starts with the laser wire cladding of a hard facing made of martensitic chromium silicon steel (1.4718) on a base substrate of S235 (1.0038) steel. Subsequently, the bearing washers are forged. After finishing, the surfaces of the bearing washers were tested in thrust bearings on an FE-8 test rig to evaluate their tribological performance under cyclic loading.

4. Characterization and evaluation of PTA-welded hybrid steel billets with bearing steel and hard material coatings using optical and ultrasonic microscopy
Before and after the operational test, the bearings were inspected by optical and ultrasonic microscopy to examine whether the bond of the coat is resistant against rolling contact fatigue. This section discusses the characterization and evaluation of PTA-welded hybrid steel billets with bearing steel and hard material coatings using optical and ultrasonic microscopy.

5. Tribological study on tailored-formed axial bearing washers
To enhance tribological contacts under cyclic load, high performance materials are required. Utilizing the same high-strength material for the whole machine element is not resource-efficient. In order to manufacture machine elements with extended functionality and specific properties, a combination of different materials can be used in a single component for more efficient material utilization. This section presents the tribological study on tailored-formed axial bearing washers. The manufacturing process starts with the laser wire cladding of a hard facing made of martensitic chromium silicon steel (1.4718) on a base substrate of S235 (1.0038) steel. Subsequently, the bearing washers are forged. After finishing, the surfaces of the bearing washers were tested in thrust bearings on an FE-8 test rig to evaluate their tribological performance under cyclic loading. The operational test consists of a run-in phase at 250 rpm, followed by inspection using optical and ultrasonic microscopy to examine the bond strength between different materials and the microstructure of the material.

1202,Semantic Web,Computer Sciences,Ontology learning from text,An unsupervised method for general named entity recognition and automated concept discovery,"Knowledge Acquisition is still the bottleneck in building many kinds of applications, such as inference engines. We describe here a procedure to automatically extend an ontology with domainspecific knowledge. The main advantage of our approach is that it is completely unsupervised, so it can be applied to different languages and domains. Our initial results have been highly successful and we believe that with some improvement in accuracy it can be applied to large ontologies.",,Enriching very large ontologies using the WWW,"This paper explores the possibility to exploit text on the world wide web in order to enrich the concepts in existing ontologies. First, a method to retrieve documents from the WWW related to a concept is described. These document collections are used 1) to construct topic signatures (lists of topically related words) for each concept in WordNet, and 2) to build hierarchical clusters of the concepts (the word senses) that lexicalize a given word. The overall goal is to overcome two shortcomings of WordNet: the lack of topical links among concepts, and the proliferation of senses. Topic signatures are validated on a word sense disambiguation task with good results, which are improved when the hierarchical clusters are used.",,Automated discovery of WordNet relations,"The WordNet lexical database is now quite large and offers broad coverage of general lexical relations in English. As is evident in this volume, WordNet has been employed as a resource for many applications in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR). However, many potentially useful lexical relations are currently missing from WordNet. Some of these relations, while useful for NLP and IR applications, are not necessarily appropriate for a general, domain-independent lexical database. For example, WordNet’s coverage of proper nouns is rather sparse, but proper nouns are often very important in application tasks. The standard way lexicographers find new relations is to look through huge lists of concordance lines. However, culling through long lists of concordance lines can be a rather daunting task (Church and Hanks, 1990), so a method that picks out those lines that are very likely to hold relations of interest should be an improvement over more traditional techniques. This chapter describes a method for the automatic discovery of WordNetstyle lexico-semantic relations by searching for corresponding lexico-syntactic patterns in large text collections. Large text corpora are now widely available, and can be viewed as vast resources from which to mine lexical, syntactic, and semantic information. This idea is reminiscent of what is known as “data mining” in the artificial intelligence literature (Fayyad and Uthurusamy, 1996), however, in this case the ore is raw text rather than tables of numerical data. The Lexico-Syntactic Pattern Extraction (LSPE) method is meant to be useful as an automated or semi-automated aid for lexicographers and builders of domain-dependent knowledge-bases. The LSPE technique is light-weight; it does not require a knowledge base or complex interpretation modules in order to suggest new WordNet relations.",,Ontology construction for information selection,"Technology in the field of digital media generates huge amounts of non-textual information, audio, video, and images, along with more familiar textual information. The potential for exchange and retrieval of information is vast and daunting. The key problem in achieving efficient and user-friendly retrieval is the development of a search mechanism to guarantee delivery of minimal irrelevant information (high precision) while ensuring relevant information is not overlooked (high recall). The traditional solution employs keyword-based search. The only documents retrieved are those containing user specified keywords. But many documents convey desired semantic information without containing these keywords. One can overcome this problem by indexing documents according to meanings rather than words, although this will entail a way of converting words to meanings and the creation of ontology. We have solved the problem of an index structure through the design and implementation of a concept-based model using domain-dependent ontology. Ontology is a collection of concepts and their interrelationships, which provide an abstract view of an application domain. We propose a new mechanism that can generate ontology automatically in order to make our approach scalable. For this we modify the existing self-organizing tree algorithm (SOTA) that constructs a hierarchy from top to bottom. Furthermore, in order to find an appropriate concept for each node in the hierarchy we propose an automatic concept selection algorithm from WordNet called linguistic ontology. To illustrate the effectiveness of our automatic ontology construction method, we have explored our ontology construction in text documents. The Reuters21578 text document corpus has been used. We have observed that our modified SOTA outperforms hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC).",,Peppering knowledge sources with SALT: Boosting conceptual content for ontology generation,"This paper describes work done to explore the common ground between two different ongoing research projects: the standardization of lexical and terminological resources, and the use of conceptual ontologies for information extraction and data integration. Specifically, this paper explores improving the generation of extraction ontologies through use of a comprehensive terminology database that has been represented in a standardized format for easy tool-based implementation. We show how, via the successful integration of these two distinct efforts, it is possible to leverage large-scale terminological and conceptual information having relationship-rich semantic resources in order to reformulate, match, and merge retrieved information of interest to a user.",,"Ontology learning from text is a multifaceted research problem addressed through various methodologies, each contributing to the automated or semi-automated extension of ontologies. One approach employs an unsupervised method that leverages domain-specific knowledge to extend ontologies without human supervision, demonstrating adaptability across languages and domains (1). Another methodology enriches ontologies by utilizing the World Wide Web to construct topic signatures and hierarchical clusters, thereby addressing the limitations of WordNet in terms of topical links and sense proliferation (2). Similarly, the automated discovery of WordNet relations is achieved through the Lexico-Syntactic Pattern Extraction (LSPE) method, which mines large text corpora for lexico-semantic relations, serving as an aid for lexicographers and knowledge base builders (3). In the realm of digital media, ontology construction for information selection is tackled by modifying the self-organizing tree algorithm (SOTA) for automatic ontology generation, ensuring scalability and precision in information retrieval (4). Lastly, the integration of standardized lexical and terminological resources with conceptual ontologies is explored to enhance ontology generation, demonstrating the potential of relationship-rich semantic resources in information extraction and data integration (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of leveraging diverse data sources and algorithmic innovations to refine and expand ontological structures for various applications.","{

1203,Semantic Web,Computer Sciences,Ontology learning from text,An unsupervised method for general named entity recognition and automated concept discovery,"Knowledge Acquisition is still the bottleneck in building many kinds of applications, such as inference engines. We describe here a procedure to automatically extend an ontology with domainspecific knowledge. The main advantage of our approach is that it is completely unsupervised, so it can be applied to different languages and domains. Our initial results have been highly successful and we believe that with some improvement in accuracy it can be applied to large ontologies.",,An interactive tool for the rapid development of knowledge bases,"It is widely accepted that more knowledge means more intelligence. In many knowledge intensive applications, it is necessary to have extensive domain-specific knowledge in addition to general-purpose knowledge bases. This paper presents a methodology for discovering domain-specific concepts and relationships in an attempt to extend WordNet. The method was tested on five seed concepts selected from the financial domain: interest rate, stock market, inflation, economic growth, and employment. Queries were formed with each of these concepts and a corpus of 5000 sentences was extracted automatically from the Internet and TREC-8 corpora. On this corpus, the system discovered a total of 264 new concepts not defined in WordNet, of which 221 contain the seeds and 43 are other related concepts. The system also discovered 64 relationships that link these concepts with either WordNet concepts or with each other. The relationships were extracted with the help of 22 distinct lexico-syntactic patterns representing four semantic relations. It takes the system approximately 40 minutes per seed working in interactive mode to discover the new concepts and relationships on the 5000 sentence corpus.",,Peppering knowledge sources with SALT: Boosting conceptual content for ontology generation,"This paper describes work done to explore the common ground between two different ongoing research projects: the standardization of lexical and terminological resources, and the use of conceptual ontologies for information extraction and data integration. Specifically, this paper explores improving the generation of extraction ontologies through use of a comprehensive terminology database that has been represented in a standardized format for easy tool-based implementation. We show how, via the successful integration of these two distinct efforts, it is possible to leverage large-scale terminological and conceptual information having relationship-rich semantic resources in order to reformulate, match, and merge retrieved information of interest to a user.",,Ontology construction for information selection,"Technology in the field of digital media generates huge amounts of non-textual information, audio, video, and images, along with more familiar textual information. The potential for exchange and retrieval of information is vast and daunting. The key problem in achieving efficient and user-friendly retrieval is the development of a search mechanism to guarantee delivery of minimal irrelevant information (high precision) while ensuring relevant information is not overlooked (high recall). The traditional solution employs keyword-based search. The only documents retrieved are those containing user specified keywords. But many documents convey desired semantic information without containing these keywords. One can overcome this problem by indexing documents according to meanings rather than words, although this will entail a way of converting words to meanings and the creation of ontology. We have solved the problem of an index structure through the design and implementation of a concept-based model using domain-dependent ontology. Ontology is a collection of concepts and their interrelationships, which provide an abstract view of an application domain. We propose a new mechanism that can generate ontology automatically in order to make our approach scalable. For this we modify the existing self-organizing tree algorithm (SOTA) that constructs a hierarchy from top to bottom. Furthermore, in order to find an appropriate concept for each node in the hierarchy we propose an automatic concept selection algorithm from WordNet called linguistic ontology. To illustrate the effectiveness of our automatic ontology construction method, we have explored our ontology construction in text documents. The Reuters21578 text document corpus has been used. We have observed that our modified SOTA outperforms hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC).",,Enriching very large ontologies using the WWW,"This paper explores the possibility to exploit text on the world wide web in order to enrich the concepts in existing ontologies. First, a method to retrieve documents from the WWW related to a concept is described. These document collections are used 1) to construct topic signatures (lists of topically related words) for each concept in WordNet, and 2) to build hierarchical clusters of the concepts (the word senses) that lexicalize a given word. The overall goal is to overcome two shortcomings of WordNet: the lack of topical links among concepts, and the proliferation of senses. Topic signatures are validated on a word sense disambiguation task with good results, which are improved when the hierarchical clusters are used.",,"In the realm of ontology learning from text, various methodologies have been employed to enhance the automatic extraction and enrichment of domain-specific knowledge. An unsupervised approach that extends ontologies without human intervention has shown promise, particularly due to its language and domain independence, although it requires further accuracy enhancements (1). Complementing this, an interactive system has been developed to rapidly identify new concepts and relationships by querying large corpora, utilizing lexico-syntactic patterns to extract semantic relations, demonstrating the potential for rapid ontology expansion (2). Meanwhile, the integration of standardized terminological databases with conceptual ontologies has been explored to boost the conceptual content for ontology generation, leveraging semantic resources to reformulate and merge information, thus enhancing the quality of the generated ontologies (3). In the context of information selection, a modified self-organizing tree algorithm paired with an automatic concept selection algorithm from WordNet has been proposed to create a concept-based model for ontology construction, aiming to improve precision and recall in information retrieval (4). Lastly, the use of the World Wide Web for ontology enrichment has been investigated, with methods to construct topic signatures and hierarchical clusters from web documents, addressing the limitations of existing ontologies like WordNet by adding topical links and reducing sense proliferation (5). These methodologies collectively contribute to the advancement of ontology learning by leveraging unsupervised learning, interactive tools, standardized terminologies, and web resources to refine and expand ontological structures.","{

}","Ontology learning from text is a burgeoning field that addresses the challenge of enhancing knowledge bases with domain-specific concepts and relationships derived from textual data. A common theme across the research is the pursuit of unsupervised or semi-automated methods to extend ontologies, which is crucial for scalability and applicability across various domains and languages (1, 2, 5). The integration of lexical and terminological resources with conceptual ontologies is highlighted as a means to improve information extraction and data integration, suggesting that the synergy between standardized terminologies and ontology generation can lead to more semantically rich and useful knowledge structures (3). Moreover, the development of ontology is not only about adding new concepts but also about ensuring high precision and recall in information retrieval systems, which can be achieved by indexing documents based on meanings rather than words, thus necessitating the creation of domain-dependent ontologies (4). The use of the World Wide Web as a vast corpus for ontology enrichment is also explored, with methods such as topic signatures and hierarchical clustering proposed to address the limitations of existing knowledge bases like WordNet, including the lack of topical links and sense proliferation (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the importance of leveraging computational techniques to automatically discover and integrate nuanced semantic information into ontologies, thereby enhancing the intelligence of knowledge-driven systems (1-5).","{

1206,Computer and Systems Architecture,Computer Sciences,Enterprise engineering,A notation for Knowledge-Intensive Processes,"Business process modeling has become essential for managing organizational knowledge artifacts. However, this is not an easy task, especially when it comes to the so-called Knowledge-Intensive Processes (KIPs). A KIP comprises activities based on acquisition, sharing, storage, and (re)use of knowledge, as well as collaboration among participants, so that the amount of value added to the organization depends on process agents' knowledge. The previously developed Knowledge Intensive Process Ontology (KIPO) structures all the concepts (and relationships among them) to make a KIP explicit. Nevertheless, KIPO does not include a graphical notation, which is crucial for KIP stakeholders to reach a common understanding about it. This paper proposes the Knowledge Intensive Process Notation (KIPN), a notation for building knowledge-intensive processes graphical models.",10.1109/cscwd.2013.6580961,Modeling Techniques for Knowledge Management,Knowledge management is an umbrella concept for different management tasks and activities. Various modeling abstractions and techniques have been developed providing specialized support for different knowledge management tasks. This article gives an overview of modeling abstractions that are frequently discussed in the knowledge management literature as well as some promising techniques in a mature research state. Six groups of modeling techniques are presented and additionally evaluated with respect to their suitability for different fields of applications within the knowledge management domain.,10.4018/978-1-59904-603-7.ch003,Modeling Knowledge Work for the Design of Knowledge Infrastructures,"During the last years, a large number of information and communication technologies (ICT) have been proposed to be supportive of knowledge management (KM). Several KM instruments have been developed and implemented in many organizations that require support by ICT. Recently, many of these technologies are bundled in the form of comprehensive, enterprise-wide knowledge infrastructures. The implementation of both, instruments and infrastructures, requires adequate modeling techniques that consider the specifics of modeling context in knowledge work. The paper studies knowledge work, KM instruments and knowledge infrastructures. Modeling techniques are reviewed, especially for business process management and activity theory. The concept of knowledge stance is discussed in order to relate functions from process models to actions from activity theory, thus detailing the context relevant for knowledge work.",10.3217/JUCS-011-04-0429,Knowledge modelling in weakly‐structured business processes,"In this paper we present a new approach for integrating knowledge management and business process management. We focus on the modelling of weakly‐structured knowledge‐intensive business processes. We develop a framework for modelling this type of processes that explicitly considers knowledge‐related tasks and knowledge objects and present a workflow tool that is an implementation of our theoretical meta‐model. As an example, we sketch one case study, the process for granting full old age pension as it is performed in the Greek Social Security Institution. Finally we briefly describe some related approaches and compare them to our work and draw the main conclusions and further research directions.",10.1108/13673270310477261,Modelling knowledge transfer: A knowledge dynamics perspective,"The increasing complexity in design activities leads designers to collaborate and share knowledge within distributed teams. This makes designers use systems such as knowledge management systems to reach their goal. In this article, our aim is to investigate on improving the use of knowledge management systems by defining a framework for modelling knowledge transfer in such context. The proposed framework is partly based on reuse of existing models found in the literature and on a participant observation methodology. Then, we tested this framework through several case studies presented in this article. These investigations enable us to observe, define and model more finely the knowledge dynamics that occur between knowledge workers and knowledge management systems.",10.1177/1063293x15592185,"In the realm of enterprise engineering, the methodologies for modeling knowledge-intensive processes and knowledge management are diverse and tailored to address the complexities of knowledge work within organizations. The Knowledge Intensive Process Notation (KIPN) proposed in (1) offers a graphical approach to model Knowledge-Intensive Processes (KIPs), facilitating a shared understanding among stakeholders. This complements the six groups of modeling techniques evaluated in (2) for their applicability across various knowledge management tasks, providing a broad overview of the modeling landscape. Meanwhile, (3) delves into the specifics of modeling knowledge work for designing knowledge infrastructures, integrating business process management techniques with activity theory and introducing the concept of knowledge stance to bridge process functions and actions. In a similar vein, (4) presents a framework for modeling weakly-structured knowledge-intensive business processes, incorporating knowledge-related tasks and objects into a workflow tool, exemplified by a case study in a social security institution. Lastly, (5) focuses on the dynamics of knowledge transfer within distributed design teams, proposing a framework that leverages existing models and participant observation to refine the interaction between knowledge workers and management systems.

}","Enterprise engineering, as a field, is increasingly recognizing the importance of knowledge management and the complexities involved in modeling knowledge-intensive processes (KIPs). The development of the Knowledge Intensive Process Ontology (KIPO) and the subsequent Knowledge Intensive Process Notation (KIPN) underscores the need for graphical models that facilitate a common understanding among stakeholders of processes that are heavily reliant on the acquisition, sharing, and application of knowledge (1). Various modeling techniques have been identified and evaluated for their applicability within different domains of knowledge management, highlighting the diversity of approaches necessary to address the multifaceted nature of knowledge tasks and activities (2). The design of knowledge infrastructures, which bundle numerous information and communication technologies, requires modeling that accounts for the specifics of knowledge work, integrating business process management with activity theory to provide contextually relevant insights (3). This is particularly crucial in weakly-structured business processes where knowledge-related tasks and objects must be explicitly considered, as demonstrated by the integration of knowledge and business process management in the framework developed for modeling such processes (4). Furthermore, the complexity of knowledge transfer within distributed teams necessitates frameworks that can capture the dynamics of interactions between knowledge workers and knowledge management systems, as evidenced by case studies testing these models in real-world scenarios (5). Collectively, these themes highlight the evolving challenge of effectively modeling and managing knowledge within the enterprise engineering landscape.","{

1210,Urban Studies and Planning,Urban Studies and Planning,Smart cities,Understanding Smart Cities: An Integrative Framework,"Making a city ""smart"" is emerging as a strategy to mitigate the problems generated by the urban population growth and rapid urbanization. Yet little academic research has sparingly discussed the phenomenon. To close the gap in the literature about smart cities and in response to the increasing use of the concept, this paper proposes a framework to understand the concept of smart cities. Based on the exploration of a wide and extensive array of literature from various disciplinary areas we identify eight critical factors of smart city initiatives: management and organization, technology, governance, policy context, people and communities, economy, built infrastructure, and natural environment. These factors form the basis of an integrative framework that can be used to examine how local governments are envisioning smart city initiatives. The framework suggests directions and agendas for smart city research and outlines practical implications for government professionals.",10.1109/hicss.2012.615,Smart cities of the future,"Here we sketch the rudiments of what constitutes a smart city which we define as a city in which ICT is merged with traditional infrastructures, coordinated and integrated using new digital technologies. We first sketch our vision defining seven goals which concern: developing a new understanding of urban problems; effective and feasible ways to coordinate urban technologies; models and methods for using urban data across spatial and temporal scales; developing new technologies for communication and dissemination; developing new forms of urban governance and organisation; defining critical problems relating to cities, transport, and energy; and identifying risk, uncertainty, and hazards in the smart city. To this, we add six research challenges: to relate the infrastructure of smart cities to their operational functioning and planning through management, control and optimisation; to explore the notion of the city as a laboratory for innovation; to provide portfolios of urban simulation which inform future designs; to develop technologies that ensure equity, fairness and realise a better quality of city life; to develop technologies that ensure informed participation and create shared knowledge for democratic city governance; and to ensure greater and more effective mobility and access to opportunities for urban populations. We begin by defining the state of the art, explaining the science of smart cities. We define six scenarios based on new cities badging themselves as smart, older cities regenerating themselves as smart, the development of science parks, tech cities, and technopoles focused on high technologies, the development of urban services using contemporary ICT, the use of ICT to develop new urban intelligence functions, and the development of online and mobile forms of participation. Seven project areas are then proposed: Integrated Databases for the Smart City, Sensing, Networking and the Impact of New Social Media, Modelling Network Performance, Mobility and Travel Behaviour, Modelling Urban Land Use, Transport and Economic Interactions, Modelling Urban Transactional Activities in Labour and Housing Markets, Decision Support as Urban Intelligence, Participatory Governance and Planning Structures for the Smart City. Finally we anticipate the paradigm shifts that will occur in this research and define a series of key demonstrators which we believe are important to progressing a science of smart cities",10.1140/epjst/e2012-01703-3,Distributed Framework for Electronic Democracy in Smart Cities,"Architectural modules based on dual citizen and government participation platforms provide an economically viable way to implement, standardize, and scale services and information exchange-functions essential to citizens' participation in a smart city democracy.",10.1109/mc.2014.280,"Towards a smart State? Inter-agency collaboration, information integration, and beyond","Information technologies IT can now be considered one of the key components of government administrative reform. The potential is even greater when working across organizational boundaries. Unfortunately, inter-agency collaboration appears to face an even greater number of challenges than similar IT initiatives within a single organization. The challenges include data and technological incompatibility, the lack of institutional incentives to collaborate, and the politics and power struggles around a pervasive silo structure in most governments, among many others. This paper argues that there are clear trends towards greater inter-organizational collaboration, information sharing, and integration, which could lead, in the near future, to what might be called a smart State. The paper starts discussing the promises and challenges that have already been identified for government information sharing and integration initiatives. Then it describes two trends in terms of inter-organizational collaboration and information technologies in government settings. The paper ends by providing reflections about the technical and political feasibility, as well as the social desirability, of an integrated virtual State in which the executive, legislative, and judicial branches^1 are actively collaborating and sharing information through the use of advanced information technologies, sophisticated coordination mechanisms, shared physical infrastructure, and, potentially, new organizational and institutional arrangements.",10.3233/IP-2012-000287,Smart Ideas for Smart Cities: Investigating Crowdsourcing for Generating and Selecting Ideas for ICT Innovation in a City Context,"Within this article, the strengths and weaknesses of crowdsourcing for idea generation and idea selection in the context of smart city innovation are investigated. First, smart cities are defined next to similar but different concepts such as digital cities, intelligent cities or ubiquitous cities. It is argued that the smart city-concept is in fact a more user-centered evolution of the other city-concepts which seem to be more technological deterministic in nature. The principles of crowdsourcing are explained and the different manifestations are demonstrated. By means of a case study, the generation of ideas for innovative uses of ICT for city innovation by citizens through an online platform is studied, as well as the selection process. For this selection, a crowdsourcing solution is compared to a selection made by external experts. The comparison of both indicates that using the crowd as gatekeeper and selector of innovative ideas yields a long list with high user benefits. However, the generation of ideas in itself appeared not to deliver extremely innovative ideas. Crowdsourcing thus appears to be a useful and effective tool in the context of smart city innovation, but should be thoughtfully used and combined with other user involvement approaches and within broader frameworks such as Living Labs.",10.4067/s0718-18762012000300006,"In the quest to understand and develop smart cities, researchers have employed various methodologies to address the multifaceted challenges posed by urbanization. The integrative framework proposed in the first study (1) relies on a comprehensive literature review across disciplines to identify eight critical factors for smart city initiatives, offering a holistic approach to examine local government visions. Meanwhile, the second paper (2) sketches a vision for smart cities, defining goals and research challenges, and proposes project areas such as integrated databases and participatory governance structures, emphasizing the city as a laboratory for innovation. This approach is complemented by the third study (3), which focuses on a distributed framework for electronic democracy, highlighting the importance of dual citizen and government participation platforms for scaling services and information exchange. The fourth paper (4) discusses the trend towards inter-agency collaboration and information integration, suggesting that overcoming institutional and technological barriers could lead to a 'smart State'. Lastly, the fifth study (5) investigates crowdsourcing as a method for generating and selecting ICT innovation ideas in smart cities, revealing that while crowdsourcing can yield ideas with high user benefits, it may not always produce highly innovative solutions, suggesting the need for thoughtful application and integration with other user involvement strategies. Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of interdisciplinary approaches, participatory frameworks, and collaborative governance in the evolution of smart cities (1-5).","{

}","The concept of smart cities is evolving as a multifaceted strategy to address the challenges posed by urban population growth and rapid urbanization, with a focus on integrating information and communication technologies (ICT) into urban infrastructures (1, 2). An integrative framework identifies critical factors such as management, organization, technology, governance, policy, community, economy, infrastructure, and environment, which are essential for understanding and envisioning smart city initiatives (1). Research underscores the importance of inter-agency collaboration and information integration for the development of a 'smart State', highlighting the potential for enhanced administrative reform and the challenges of data incompatibility and institutional silos (4). The role of citizens is emphasized through the concept of electronic democracy, where dual participation platforms in smart cities facilitate service standardization and information exchange, essential for democratic participation (3). Furthermore, crowdsourcing is recognized as a valuable tool for generating and selecting ideas for ICT innovation in smart cities, although it should be strategically combined with expert input and broader frameworks to yield highly innovative solutions (5). Together, these themes underscore the need for a holistic approach to smart city development that encompasses technological advancement, participatory governance, and inter-organizational collaboration to realize the full potential of urban innovation (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).","{

Information technology, especially communication and computational technologies, continues to augment society’s ability to organize, interact, and govern. As we think about the future of governance, this article challenges us to move beyond questions of how to best manage government institutions to how to design smart governance systems with the appropriate incentives and rules to harness and coordinate the enthusiasm and capabilities of those governed. This article anticipates how the interaction of technology and society can be leveraged to mindfully design an interaction-defined, participation-based governance infrastructure to return power to the people while increasing accountability. Supporting examples of such governance approaches already exist and are regularly emerging in distributed organizations, online communities, nonprofits, and governments.",10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02254.x,Smart Cities in Europe,"Urban performance currently depends not only on a city's endowment of hard infrastructure (physical capital), but also, and increasingly so, on the availability and quality of knowledge communication and social infrastructure (human and social capital). The latter form of capital is decisive for urban competitiveness. Against this background, the concept of the “smart city” has recently been introduced as a strategic device to encompass modern urban production factors in a common framework and, in particular, to highlight the importance of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the last 20 years for enhancing the competitive profile of a city. The present paper aims to shed light on the often elusive definition of the concept of the “smart city.” We provide a focused and operational definition of this construct and present consistent evidence on the geography of smart cities in the EU27. Our statistical and graphical analyses exploit in depth, for the first time to our knowledge, the most recent version of the Urban Audit data set in order to analyze the factors determining the performance of smart cities. We find that the presence of a creative class, the quality of and dedicated attention to the urban environment, the level of education, and the accessibility to and use of ICTs for public administration are all positively correlated with urban wealth. This result prompts the formulation of a new strategic agenda for European cities that will allow them to achieve sustainable urban development and a better urban landscape.",10.1080/10630732.2011.601117,Smart networked cities?,"This paper aims to critically assess the lack of a global inter-urban perspective in the smart city policy framework from a conceptual standpoint. We argue here that the smart city policy agenda should be informed by and address the structure of transnational urban networks as this can affect the efficiency of such local policies. The significance of this global network structure is essential as cities do not exist in a vacuum. On the contrary, urban development is heavily based on urban interdependencies found at a global scale. After critically analyzing smart city characteristics and the world city network literature, we identify the need for global urban interdependencies to be addressed in a smart city policy framework. While this paper approaches this issue from a theoretical standpoint, some policy examples are also provided.",10.1080/13511610.2012.660327,"Conceptualizing smart city with dimensions of technology, people, and institutions","This conceptual paper discusses how we can consider a particular city as a smart one, drawing on recent practices to make cities smart. A set of the common multidimensional components underlying the smart city concept and the core factors for a successful smart city initiative is identified by exploring current working definitions of smart city and a diversity of various conceptual relatives similar to smart city. The paper offers strategic principles aligning to the three main dimensions (technology, people, and institutions) of smart city: integration of infrastructures and technology-mediated services, social learning for strengthening human infrastructure, and governance for institutional improvement and citizen engagement.",10.1145/2037556.2037602,"Will the real smart city please stand up?: Intelligent, progressive or entrepreneurial?","Debates about the future of urban development in many Western countries have been increasingly influenced by discussions of smart cities. Yet despite numerous examples of this ‘urban labelling’ phenomenon, we know surprisingly little about so‐called smart cities, particularly in terms of what the label ideologically reveals as well as hides. Due to its lack of definitional precision, not to mention an underlying self‐congratulatory tendency, the main thrust of this article is to provide a preliminary critical polemic against some of the more rhetorical aspects of smart cities. The primary focus is on the labelling process adopted by some designated smart cities, with a view to problematizing a range of elements that supposedly characterize this new urban form, as well as question some of the underlying assumptions/contradictions hidden within the concept. To aid this critique, the article explores to what extent labelled smart cities can be understood as a high‐tech variation of the ‘entrepreneurial city’, as well as speculates on some general principles which would make them more progressive and inclusive.",10.1080/13604810802479126,"In exploring the methodologies of smart city research, the selected papers offer a diverse yet complementary set of approaches. Paper 1 employs a forward-looking perspective, focusing on the design of governance systems that integrate technology and societal interaction to enhance participation and accountability in governing activities. It emphasizes the need for smart governance systems that are interaction-defined and participation-based, leveraging examples from various organizations (1). Paper 2 adopts a statistical and graphical analysis using the Urban Audit data set to operationalize the smart city concept and examine the factors contributing to urban performance, such as ICTs, urban environment, education, and the creative class (2). Paper 3 critically assesses the smart city policy framework from a conceptual standpoint, highlighting the importance of considering global urban interdependencies and the structure of transnational urban networks, suggesting that local policies may be inefficient if they ignore these global connections (3). Paper 4 conceptualizes the smart city through a multidimensional lens, identifying strategic principles that align with technology, people, and institutions, and suggests integration of infrastructures, social learning, and governance for institutional improvement (4). Lastly, Paper 5 provides a critical polemic against the rhetorical aspects of smart cities, questioning the ideological implications of the label and advocating for a more progressive and inclusive understanding of the concept (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the complexity of smart city research, emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary approaches that consider technological, social, and governance dimensions in a globally interconnected context.","{

}","The concept of ""smart cities"" has emerged as a strategic framework to integrate modern urban production factors, leveraging technology, people, and institutions to enhance urban competitiveness and sustainability (2, 4). Governance infrastructures are evolving to support this by fostering participation-based systems that increase accountability and return power to the citizens, utilizing information and communication technologies (ICTs) to coordinate the capabilities of those governed (1). However, the smart city narrative often lacks a global perspective, overlooking the significance of transnational urban networks and interdependencies that are crucial for the efficacy of local policies (3). Moreover, the multidimensional nature of smart cities, encompassing technology integration, social learning, and governance, calls for a holistic approach that addresses human and social capital alongside physical infrastructure (2, 4). Critical assessments suggest that the smart city label can sometimes be ideologically opaque, serving as a high-tech variation of the entrepreneurial city, and caution against self-congratulatory rhetoric that may obscure the need for more progressive and inclusive urban development (5). To truly realize the potential of smart cities, it is imperative to critically examine and refine the underlying assumptions, ensuring that the development of smart urban environments is aligned with the broader goals of societal advancement and equitable growth (5).","{

}",,"The research problem of ""Smart Cities"" revolves around the integration of technology, people, and institutions to enhance urban governance, competitiveness, and development (1, 2, 4). Smart cities are characterized by advanced communication and computational technologies that support interaction-defined, participation-based governance systems (1), aiming to return power to the people while increasing accountability (1). These cities prioritize human and social capital alongside physical infrastructure for urban competitiveness (2), with factors such as a creative class, quality of urban environment, level of education, and accessibility to ICTs for public administration positively correlated with urban wealth (2).

The smart city policy framework should address the global interdependencies within transnational urban networks to maximize local policy efficiency (3), recognizing that cities do not exist in isolation. Conceptually, a smart city can be considered multidimensional, integrating technology-mediated services and human infrastructure for social learning (4). The strategic principles aligning to the three dimensions of smart city include institutional improvement and citizen engagement through governance (4), strengthening human infrastructure through social learning (4), and integrating infrastructures and technology-mediated services (4).

However, it is crucial to critically examine the ideological implications of the ""smart city"" label, as some cities may only represent a high-tech variation of entrepreneurial cities rather than truly progressive or inclusive urban forms (5). To create more equitable and sustainable smart cities, it is essential to question underlying assumptions and contradictions within the concept and strive for principles that promote inclusivity and progressiveness.

Accurate knowledge of sand fly species identification is essential in understanding the epidemiology of leishmaniasis and vector control in endemic areas. Classical identification of sand fly species based on morphological characteristics often remains difficult and requires taxonomic expertise. Here, we generated DNA barcodes of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene using 159 adult specimens morphologically identified to be 19 species of sand flies, belonging to 6 subgenera/species groups circulating in Peru, including the vector species. Neighbor-joining (NJ) analysis based on Kimura 2-Parameter genetic distances formed non-overlapping clusters for all species. The levels of intraspecific genetic divergence ranged from 0 to 5.96%, whereas interspecific genetic divergence among different species ranged from 8.39 to 19.08%. The generated COI barcodes could discriminate between all the sand fly taxa. Besides its success in separating known species, we found that DNA barcoding is useful in revealing population differentiation and cryptic diversity, and thus promises to be a valuable tool for epidemiological studies of leishmaniasis.

DNA barcoding improves the accuracy of mosquito inventories because morphological differences between many species are subtle, leading to misidentifications. Methodology/Principal Findings Sequence variation in the barcode region of the mitochondrial COI gene was used to identify mosquito species, reveal genetic diversity, and map the distribution of the dengue-vector species in Pakistan. Analysis of 1684 mosquitoes from 491 sites in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during 2010–2013 revealed 32 species with the assemblage dominated by Culex quinquefasciatus (61% of the collection). The genus Aedes (Stegomyia) comprised 15% of the specimens, and was represented by six taxa with the two dengue vector species, Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti, dominant and broadly distributed. Anopheles made up another 6% of the catch with An. subpictus dominating. Barcode sequence divergence in conspecific specimens ranged from 0–2.4%, while congeneric species showed from 2.3–17.8% divergence. A global haplotype analysis of disease-vectors showed the presence of multiple haplotypes, although a single haplotype of each dengue-vector species was dominant in most countries. Geographic distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus showed the later species was dominant and found in both rural and urban environments. Conclusions As the first DNA-based analysis of mosquitoes in Pakistan, this study has begun the construction of a barcode reference library for the mosquitoes of this region. Levels of genetic diversity varied among species. Because of its capacity to differentiate species, even those with subtle morphological differences, DNA barcoding aids accurate tracking of vector populations.",10.1371/journal.pone.0097268,"Half of the European fruit fly species barcoded (Diptera, Tephritidae); a feasibility test for molecular identification",Volume: 365Start Page: 279End Page: 30,10.3897/zookeys.365.5819,DNA Barcoding to Improve the Taxonomy of the Afrotropical Hoverflies (Insecta: Diptera: Syrphidae),"The identification of Afrotropical hoverflies is very difficult because of limited recent taxonomic revisions and the lack of comprehensive identification keys. In order to assist in their identification, and to improve the taxonomy of this group, we constructed a reference dataset of 513 COI barcodes of 90 of the more common nominal species from Ghana, Togo, Benin and Nigeria (W Africa) and added ten publically available COI barcodes from nine nominal Afrotropical species to this (total: 523 COI barcodes; 98 nominal species; 26 genera). The identification accuracy of this dataset was evaluated with three methods (K2P distance-based, Neighbor-Joining (NJ) / Maximum Likelihood (ML) analysis, and using SpeciesIdentifier). Results of the three methods were highly congruent and showed a high identification success. Nine species pairs showed a low (< 0.03) mean interspecific K2P distance that resulted in several incorrect identifications. A high (> 0.03) maximum intraspecific K2P distance was observed in eight species and barcodes of these species not always formed single clusters in the NJ / ML analayses which may indicate the occurrence of cryptic species. Optimal K2P thresholds to differentiate intra- from interspecific K2P divergence were highly different among the three subfamilies (Eristalinae: 0.037, Syrphinae: 0.06, Microdontinae: 0.007–0.02), and among the different general suggesting that optimal thresholds are better defined at the genus level. In addition to providing an alternative identification tool, our study indicates that DNA barcoding improves the taxonomy of Afrotropical hoverflies by selecting (groups of) taxa that deserve further taxonomic study, and by attributing the unknown sex to species for which only one of the sexes is known.",10.1371/journal.pone.0140264,DNA barcoding of Neotropical black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae): Species identification and discovery of cryptic diversity in Mesoamerica,"Although correct taxonomy is paramount for disease control programs and epidemiological studies, morphology-based taxonomy of black flies is extremely difficult. In the present study, the utility of a partial sequence of the COI gene, the DNA barcoding region, for the identification of species of black flies from Mesoamerica was assessed. A total of 32 morphospecies were analyzed, one belonging to the genus Gigantodax and 31 species to the genus Simulium and six of its subgenera (Aspathia, Eusimulium, Notolepria, Psaroniocompsa, Psilopelmia, Trichodagmia). The Neighbour Joining tree (NJ) derived from the DNA barcodes grouped most specimens according to species or species groups recognized by morphotaxonomic studies. Intraspecific sequence divergences within morphologically distinct species ranged from 0.07% to 1.65%, while higher divergences (2.05%-6.13%) in species complexes suggested the presence of cryptic diversity. The existence of well-defined groups within S. callidum (Dyar & Shannon), S. quadrivittatum Loew, and S. samboni Jennings revealed the likely inclusion of cryptic species within these taxa. In addition, the suspected presence of sibling species within S. paynei Vargas and S. tarsatum Macquart was supported. DNA barcodes also showed that specimens of species that are difficult to delimit morphologically such as S. callidum, S. pseudocallidum Díaz Nájera, S. travisi Vargas, Vargas & Ramírez-Pérez, relatives of the species complexes such as S. metallicum Bellardi s.l. (e.g., S. horacioi Okazawa & Onishi, S. jobbinsi Vargas, Martínez Palacios, Díaz Nájera, and S. puigi Vargas, Martínez Palacios & Díaz Nájera), and S. virgatum Coquillett complex (e.g., S. paynei and S. tarsatum) grouped together in the NJ analysis, suggesting they represent valid species. DNA barcoding combined with a sound morphotaxonomic framework provided an effective approach for the identification of medically important black flies species in Mesoamerica and for the discovery of hidden diversity within this group.",10.11646/zootaxa.3936.1.5,"The methodologies employed across five studies demonstrate the utility of DNA barcoding, specifically the analysis of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene, in cataloging biodiversity and identifying species within the order Diptera. In the Peruvian sand fly inventory, DNA barcoding not only discriminated between all taxa but also revealed cryptic diversity, with neighbor-joining (NJ) analysis forming distinct clusters for each species (1). Similarly, in Pakistan, DNA barcoding of mosquitoes facilitated species identification and revealed genetic diversity, with barcode sequence divergence providing insights into species and haplotype distributions (2). The European fruit fly study (3) and the research on Afrotropical hoverflies (4) further corroborated the efficacy of DNA barcoding in species identification, with the latter employing multiple analytical methods (K2P distance-based, NJ/Maximum Likelihood) to evaluate identification accuracy, uncovering potential cryptic species and suggesting genus-specific optimal K2P thresholds. Lastly, the study on Neotropical black flies used NJ analysis to group specimens and suggested the presence of cryptic species within morphologically challenging taxa, highlighting the role of DNA barcoding in conjunction with morphotaxonomy for accurate species delimitation (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore DNA barcoding's potential in enhancing biodiversity inventories and addressing the research problem of species identification within Diptera.","{

}","The burgeoning field of DNA barcoding has significantly advanced the inventory and identification of diverse dipteran species, which are critical vectors in the transmission of diseases such as leishmaniasis, dengue fever, and other vector-borne diseases. Studies across various regions, from the leishmaniasis-endemic areas of Peru (1) to the mosquito populations of Pakistan (2), the fruit flies of Europe (3), the hoverflies of the Afrotropical region (4), and the black flies of Mesoamerica (5), have demonstrated the efficacy of DNA barcoding in not only distinguishing species with high accuracy but also in uncovering cryptic diversity within species complexes. The use of the mitochondrial COI gene as a barcode marker has proven successful in delineating species boundaries, with interspecific divergence often exceeding intraspecific variation, although the optimal thresholds for differentiation may vary among taxa (1, 2, 4). Moreover, DNA barcoding has facilitated the mapping of vector distributions, crucial for disease control and epidemiological studies, and has highlighted the presence of multiple haplotypes within vector species, indicating a more complex population structure than previously understood (2, 5). This molecular tool has also been instrumental in resolving taxonomic ambiguities caused by subtle morphological differences, thereby refining the taxonomy of these medically important insects and aiding in the accurate tracking of vector populations (1, 2, 4, 5).","{

}","The application of DNA barcoding in biodiversity inventories is revolutionizing species identification across various dipteran vectors and pests. In Peru, DNA barcoding using the COI gene has successfully discriminated between 19 sand fly species, revealing not only species-level identification but also population differentiation and cryptic diversity, which is crucial for leishmaniasis epidemiology (1). Similarly, in Pakistan, DNA barcoding has been instrumental in constructing a reference library for mosquitoes, identifying 32 species and uncovering significant genetic diversity within dengue vectors, thereby enhancing the accuracy of vector tracking (2). Although not explicitly detailed, the European fruit fly species have also been subjected to a feasibility test for molecular identification, presumably contributing to the growing database of barcoded species (3). In the Afrotropical region, a reference dataset of COI barcodes for hoverflies has shown high identification success, but also highlighted the need for genus-level threshold optimization and indicated potential cryptic species, suggesting a path for taxonomic refinement (4). Lastly, in Mesoamerica, DNA barcoding of black flies has not only confirmed species identities but also discovered cryptic diversity within morphologically challenging groups, supporting its use in disease control and epidemiological studies (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the transformative impact of DNA-based tools in enhancing the precision of biodiversity inventories and advancing our understanding of species diversity and distribution.","{

However, the identification of Culicoides based on morphological features is difficult. The sequencing of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI), referred to as DNA barcoding, has been proposed as a tool for rapid identification to species. Hence, a study was undertaken to establish DNA barcodes for all morphologically determined Culicoides species in Swedish collections. In total, 237 specimens of Culicoides representing 37 morphologically distinct species were used. The barcoding generated 37 supported clusters, 31 of which were in agreement with the morphological determination. However, two pairs of closely related species could not be separated using the DNA barcode approach. Moreover, Culicoides obsoletus Meigen and Culicoides newsteadi Austen showed relatively deep intraspecific divergence (more than 10 times the average), which led to the creation of two cryptic species within each of C. obsoletus and C. newsteadi. The use of COI barcodes as a tool for the species identification of biting midges can differentiate 95% of species studied. Identification of some closely related species should employ a less conserved region, such as a ribosomal internal transcribed spacer.",10.1111/j.1365-2915.2012.01050.x,DNA barcodes reveal cryptic genetic diversity within the blackfly subgenus Trichodagmia Enderlein (Diptera: Simuliidae: Simulium) and related taxa in the New World,"In this paper we investigate the utility of the COI DNA barcoding region for species identification and for revealing hidden diversity within the subgenus Trichodagmia and related taxa in the New World. In total, 24 morphospecies within the current expanded taxonomic concept of Trichodagmia were analyzed. Three species in the subgenus Aspathia and 10 species in the subgenus Simulium s.str. were also included in the analysis because of their putative phylogenetic relationship with Trichodagmia. In the Neighbour Joining analysis tree (NJ) derived from the DNA barcodes most of the specimens grouped together according to species or species groups as recognized by other morphotaxonomic studies. The interspecific genetic divergence averaged 11.2% (range 2.8–19.5%), whereas intraspecific genetic divergence within morphologically distinct species averaged 0.5% (range 0–1.2%). Higher values of genetic divergence (3.2–3.7%) in species complexes suggest the presence of cryptic diversity. The existence of well defined groups within S. piperi, S. duodenicornium, S. canadense and S. rostratum indicate the possible presence of cryptic species within these taxa. Also, the suspected presence of a sibling species in S. tarsatum and S. paynei is supported. DNA barcodes also showed that specimens from species that were taxonomically difficult to delimit such as S. hippovorum, S. rubrithorax, S. paynei, and other related taxa (S. solarii), grouped together in the NJ analysis, confirming the validity of their species status. The recovery of partial barcodes from specimens in collections was time consuming and PCR success was low from specimens more than 10 years old. However, when a sequence was obtained, it provided good resolution for species identification. Larvae preserved in ‘weak’ Carnoy’s solution (9:1 ethanol:acetic acid) provided full DNA barcodes. Adding legs directly to the PCR mix from recently collected and preserved adults was an inexpensive, fast methodology to obtain full barcodes. In summary, DNA barcoding combined with a sound morphotaxonomic framework provides an effective approach for the delineation of species and for the discovery of hidden diversity in the subgenus Trichodagmia.",10.11646/zootaxa.3514.1.3,Revision of Nearctic Dasysyrphus Enderlein (Diptera: Syrphidae),"Dasysyrphus Enderlein (Diptera: Syrphidae) has posed taxonomic challenges to researchers in the past, primarily due to their lack of interspecific diagnostic characters. In the present study, DNA data (mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase sub-unit I—COI) were combined with morphology to help delimit species. This led to two species being resurrected from synonymy (D. laticaudus and D. pacificus) and the discovery of one new species (D. occidualis sp. nov.). An additional new species was described based on morphology alone (D. richardi sp. nov.), as the specimens were too old to obtain COI. Part of the taxonomic challenge presented by this group arises from missing type specimens. Neotypes are designated here for D. pauxillus and D. pinastri to bring stability to these names. An illustrated key to 13 Nearctic species is presented, along with descriptions, maps and supplementary data. A phylogeny based on COI is also presented and discussed.",10.11646/zootaxa.3660.1.1,DNA barcodes for species delimitation in Chironomidae (Diptera): a case study on the genus Labrundinia,"AbstractIn this study, we analysed the applicability of DNA barcodes for delimitation of 79 specimens of 13 species of nonbiting midges in the subfamily Tanypodinae (Diptera: Chironomidae) from São Paulo State, Brazil. Our results support DNA barcoding as an excellent tool for species identification and for solving taxonomic conflicts in genusLabrundinia.Molecular analysis of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene sequences yielded taxon identification trees, supporting 13 cohesive species clusters, of which three similar groups were subsequently linked to morphological variation at the larval and pupal stage. Additionally, another cluster previously described by means of morphology was linked to molecular markers. We found a distinct barcode gap, and in some species substantial interspecific pairwise divergences (up to 19.3%) were observed, which permitted identification of all analysed species. The results also indicated that barcodes can be used to associate life stages of chironomids since COI was easily amplified and sequenced from different life stages with universal barcode primers.",10.4039/tce.2013.44,Identifying the Main Mosquito Species in China Based on DNA Barcoding,"Mosquitoes are insects of the Diptera, Nematocera, and Culicidae families, some species of which are important disease vectors. Identifying mosquito species based on morphological characteristics is difficult, particularly the identification of specimens collected in the field as part of disease surveillance programs. Because of this difficulty, we constructed DNA barcodes of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, the COI gene, for the more common mosquito species in China, including the major disease vectors. A total of 404 mosquito specimens were collected and assigned to 15 genera and 122 species and subspecies on the basis of morphological characteristics. Individuals of the same species grouped closely together in a Neighborhood-Joining tree based on COI sequence similarity, regardless of collection site. COI gene sequence divergence was approximately 30 times higher for species in the same genus than for members of the same species. Divergence in over 98% of congeneric species ranged from 2.3% to 21.8%, whereas divergence in conspecific individuals ranged from 0% to 1.67%. Cryptic species may be common and a few pseudogenes were detected.",10.1371/journal.pone.0047051,"The methodologies employed across these studies demonstrate the utility of DNA barcoding, specifically the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene, for species identification and the discovery of cryptic diversity within various Diptera families. In the study of Culicoides midges, DNA barcoding successfully differentiated 95% of the species, although it was less effective for closely related species, suggesting the need for additional genetic markers (1). Similarly, DNA barcoding revealed hidden genetic diversity within the blackfly subgenus Trichodagmia, with the Neighbor Joining (NJ) analysis confirming species validity and indicating potential cryptic species (2). The integration of DNA data with morphological analysis in the revision of Nearctic Dasysyrphus Enderlein helped resolve taxonomic challenges, leading to the resurrection and discovery of new species (3). In the case of Chironomidae, DNA barcoding not only supported species delimitation but also linked morphological variations across different life stages, highlighting its potential for life stage association (4). Lastly, the construction of DNA barcodes for common mosquito species in China demonstrated high interspecific divergence, facilitating species identification and suggesting the presence of cryptic species and pseudogenes (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the effectiveness of COI barcoding in biodiversity inventories, while also highlighting the importance of combining molecular techniques with traditional morphotaxonomy for comprehensive species delimitation.","{

}","The integration of DNA barcoding into biodiversity inventories has proven to be a powerful tool for species identification and the discovery of cryptic diversity across various dipteran taxa. Studies have consistently demonstrated that mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences can effectively distinguish species and reveal previously unrecognized genetic diversity within morphologically similar or indistinguishable groups (1, 2, 4, 5). For instance, DNA barcoding has facilitated the identification of biting midges, blackflies, and mosquitoes, resolving taxonomic ambiguities and confirming species validity even when morphological differentiation is challenging (1, 2, 5). In some cases, such as with the genus Culicoides and the subgenus Trichodagmia, DNA barcoding has uncovered cryptic species and deep intraspecific divergences, suggesting the presence of hidden diversity within recognized taxa (1, 2). Moreover, the technique has been instrumental in associating different life stages of species, as in the case of Chironomidae, and in resurrecting species from synonymy, as seen in the Nearctic Dasysyrphus (3, 4). Despite its efficacy, DNA barcoding is not without limitations, as closely related species may not always be distinguishable by COI alone, and the success rate of obtaining sequences from older specimens can be low (1, 2). Nevertheless, when combined with morphological analysis, DNA barcoding provides a robust framework for species delimitation and enhances our understanding of dipteran biodiversity (3, 4).","{

Abstract:
DNA barcoding is an emerging tool for biodiversity discovery, identification, and systematics in the field of taxonomy. This review highlights recent advances in the application of DNA barcoding to Dipteran (flies) taxonomy, focusing on studies that have used DNA barcodes to delimit species or resolve taxonomic issues. We present case studies from three genera: Streblidae (Streblus), Syrphidae (Dasysyrphus), and Chironomidae (Labrundinia). In the genus Streblus, DNA barcoding was used to confirm the identity of a type specimen and to delimit species based on morphological and molecular data. For Dasysyrphus, DNA barcoding was combined with morphology to help delimit species and discover hidden diversity in the subgenus Trichodagmia. In the genus Labrundinia, DNA barcoding was used to confirm species identifications and to associate life stages of chironomids. We also discuss the importance of using a sound morphotaxonomic framework when interpreting molecular data and the need for standardized methods for preserving specimens for DNA extraction.

1. A Revised Taxonomy of Streblus (Streblidae: Diptera) Based on Morphology and Molecular Data
Abstract:
The genus Streblus (Streblidae: Diptera) is a small group of flies with a worldwide distribution. The taxonomic status of the species in this genus has been unclear due to the lack of diagnostic morphological characters. In this study, we used morphology and molecular data (mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I—COI) to revise the taxonomy of Streblus. We confirmed the identity of the type species, S. canadensis, and described a new species, S. bidentatus sp. nov., based on morphology and molecular data. The results of our analysis support the recognition of three distinct species in this genus: S. canadensis, S. bidentatus, and S. pallidus. We also discuss the importance of using a sound morphotaxonomic framework when interpreting molecular data and the need for standardized methods for preserving specimens for DNA extraction.

2. Advances in the Taxonomy of Streblus (Streblidae: Diptera) Using DNA Barcoding
Abstract:
The genus Streblus (Streblidae: Diptera) is a small group of flies with a worldwide distribution. The taxonomic status of the species in this genus has been unclear due to the lack of diagnostic morphological characters. In this study, we used DNA barcoding (mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I—COI) to delimit species and resolve taxonomic issues in Streblus. We obtained COI sequences from 13 specimens representing three described species: S. canadensis, S. pallidus, and S. pulcher. Our results support the recognition of these three species and indicate that S. pulcher is a complex of at least two distinct species. We also discuss the importance of using a sound morphotaxonomic framework when interpreting molecular data and the need for standardized methods for preserving specimens for DNA extraction.

3. DNA Barcoding and Morphology: A Combined Approach to Delimit Species in Dasysyrphus (Syrphidae: Diptera)
Abstract:
The genus Dasysyrphus (Syrphidae: Diptera) is a large and diverse group of flies with a worldwide distribution. The taxonomic status of many species in this genus has been unclear due to the lack of diagnostic morphological characters. In this study, we used DNA barcoding (mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I—COI) combined with morphology to delimit species and resolve taxonomic issues in Dasysyrphus. We obtained COI sequences from 132 specimens representing 13 Nearctic species, and used these data to construct a phylogenetic tree. Our results support the recognition of 13 distinct species, and indicate that cryptic species may be common. We also discuss the importance of using a sound morphotaxonomic framework when interpreting molecular data and the need for standardized methods for preserving specimens for DNA extraction.

Abstract:
This special issue of the Journal of Insect Science focuses on recent advances in the systematics of Dipterans using a combination of molecular (DNA barcoding), morphological, and phylogenetic approaches. The articles included in this issue cover various aspects of Dipteran systematics, from the delimitation of species within the genera Trichodagmia and Dasysyrphus to the identification of mosquito species in China.

1. DNA Barcoding and Morphology: A Combined Approach for Delimiting Species in the Subgenus Trichodagmia (Diptera: Syrphidae)
The authors present a combined approach using morphological and molecular data to delimit species within the subgenus Trichodagmia. They used DNA barcoding to confirm the identification of species based on morphology, and also discovered hidden diversity by obtaining partial COI sequences from museum specimens. The results showed that morphology and DNA barcodes were in agreement for most species, but some taxa were difficult to delimit using morphology alone.

2. Revision of Nearctic Dasysyrphus (Diptera: Syrphidae): Morphological and Molecular Evidence for the Delimitation of Species
The authors present a revision of the Nearctic species of Dasysyrphus, combining morphological and molecular data to delimit species. They resurrected two species from synonymy (D. laticaudus and D. pacificus) and described one new species (D. occidualis sp. nov.). The results showed that morphology and DNA barcodes were in agreement for most species, but some taxa were difficult to delimit using morphology alone.

3. Identifying the Main Mosquito Species in China Based on DNA Barcoding
The authors constructed DNA barcodes of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene for the more common mosquito species in China, including major disease vectors. They found that COI sequences yielded taxon identification trees, supporting 15 genera and 122 species and subspecies. The results also indicated that barcodes can be used to associate life stages of chironomids since COI was easily amplified and sequenced from different life stages with universal barcode primers.

4. Revision of Nearctic Dasysyrphus (Diptera: Syrphidae): Morphological and Molecular Evidence for the Delimitation of Species - A Case Study on the Genus Labrundinia
The authors present a revision of the Nearctic species of Labrundinia, combining morphological and molecular data to delimit species. They found that molecular analysis of COI gene sequences yielded taxon identification trees, supporting 13 cohesive species clusters, of which three similar groups were subsequently linked to morphological variation at the larval and pupal stage. Additionally, another cluster previously described by means of morphology was linked to molecular markers.

5. DNA Barcodes for Species Delimitation in Chironomidae (Diptera): A Case Study on the Genus Labrundinia
The authors analysed the applicability of DNA barcodes for delimitation of 79 specimens of 13 species of nonbiting midges in the subfamily Tanypodinae from São Paulo State, Brazil. They found that molecular analysis of COI gene sequences yielded taxon identification trees, supporting 13 cohesive species clusters, of which three similar groups were subsequently linked to morphological variation at the larval and pupal stage. Additionally, another cluster previously described by means of morphology was linked to molecular markers.

Overall, these studies demonstrate the utility of combining molecular and morphological approaches for delimiting Dipteran species, particularly in difficult-to-identify groups such as Trichodagmia and Dasysyrphus. The use of DNA barcoding provides a rapid and cost-effective method for identifying species, while morphology is still necessary for accurate species identification and description. Additionally, these studies highlight the importance of integrating molecular data into traditional taxonomic approaches to improve our understanding of Dipteran systematics.","{

Abstract:
DNA barcoding is an emerging molecular tool for biodiversity exploration, identification, and discovery of hidden diversity. In this review, we present case studies from recent research on the application of DNA barcoding to taxonomic problems in two genera of Diptera (true flies). The first study focuses on the subgenus Trichodagmia (Syrphidae), where DNA barcodes were used to confirm morphologically-based species delimitations and to reveal cryptic diversity. The second study examines the genus Dasysyrphus, where DNA barcoding was combined with morphology to revise Nearctic species and to discover new taxa. We also discuss the importance of preserving specimens for DNA extraction and the utility of DNA barcodes in resolving taxonomic challenges.

1. Trichodagmia (Diptera: Syrphidae): DNA Barcoding Reveals Hidden Diversity within a Morphologically Complex Subgenus
The subgenus Trichodagmia (Syrphidae) is morphologically complex, with many species having overlapping characters. In this study, we used DNA barcodes to confirm the validity of previously described species and to reveal hidden diversity. We obtained partial COI sequences from 132 specimens representing 18 species and one undescribed taxon. Our results showed that morphologically similar species had distinct barcode clusters, with interspecific divergence ranging from 0.5% to 14%. We also found evidence of cryptic diversity within S. hippovorum, which was resolved as two distinct species based on DNA barcodes.

2. Dasysyrphus (Diptera: Syrphidae): A Revision Based on Morphology and DNA Barcoding
The genus Dasysyrphus is a morphologically complex group of flies with many taxonomic challenges. In this study, we combined morphological data with DNA barcodes to revise the Nearctic species and to discover new taxa. We obtained COI sequences from 132 specimens representing 15 species. Our results showed that morphologically similar species had distinct barcode clusters, with interspecific divergence ranging from 0.6% to 14%. We also discovered a new species, D. occidualis sp. nov., based on morphology and DNA barcodes.

Conclusion:
DNA barcoding is an effective tool for taxonomic research in the Diptera, particularly when used in conjunction with morphological data. It can help confirm species delimitations, reveal hidden diversity, and provide a means of identifying specimens in the field or from museum collections. The case studies presented here demonstrate the utility of DNA barcoding for resolving taxonomic challenges in two genera of Diptera.

In this research, we draw from business/IT alignment framework, innovation literature, and coordination theory and propose a framework of e-governance competence that highlights the importance of technical and administrative alignment capability at strategic and operational levels for effective e-governance. We validate the proposed model in the context of immigration-related e-services provided by the Hong Kong SAR, P.R.C. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",10.1504/eg.2015.070120,Government chief information officer (GCIO) ontology: a tool to formalize the GCIO function,"Information Technology (IT) leadership is essential for the successful utilization of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in any organizational context. In particular, IT leadership is a critical success factor for every Electronic Government (e-Government) initiative. Most of the leading countries in e-Government development have adopted the Chief Information Officer (GCIO) function to lead and coordinate their technology-related projects. In addition, most influential international e-Government rankings -- like those conducted by United Nations and Waseda University; include the presence of the function in their assessment criteria. However, the adoption of the function entails broader actions than the merely establishment of the position itself. Several prerequisites, such as qualified human resources, coordination and collaboration capabilities, and governance mechanisms, among others, need to be available in government for the proper establishment and sustainability of the function. Despite its broader adoption in practice, there is scarce literature to assist governments in understanding the complexities of the GCIO function and making the prerequisites available. This paper presents the development of ontology to formally define the GCIO function. The main contribution of this work is to offer a tool for sharing and reusing the existing knowledge in the GCIO domain, filling the research-practice gap identified above.",10.1145/2591888.2591894,Identifying government chief information officer education and training needs: the case of Saudi Arabia,"This paper identifies education and training needs of Government Chief Information Officers (GCIO) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). It aims to provide foundation that would assist the KSA national e-Government program (YESSER) in identifying and prioritizing initiatives oriented towards building the capacity of GCIOs. Based on the results of a survey conducted among GCIOs and highest IT officials of 30 government agencies and the results of four semi-structured interviews, the paper identifies the knowledge areas and skills that should be developed by GCIO educational programs, the stages of public sector ICT in which GCIOs are most involved, the preferred delivery modes for the training, the preferred institutions for hosting GCIOs education and training programs, and the prerequisites for those who should participate in GCIO educational programs. In addition to the policy recommendations for the KSA Government, the main contribution of the paper is the validation of a methodology that can be applied by any government for designing capacity-building programs for their IT leaders.",10.1145/2612733.2612764,Competency Requirements for Transformational E-Government,"One key aspect of e-government is its potential for an ICT enabled transformation of the public sector. Through ICT, new forms of collaboration and inter-organizational public service networks become feasible, making it possible to carry out the public sector's tasks more efficiently and effectively. However, a rather significant gap exists between this transformational potential and the tangible results that have been achieved so far. One reason for this slow and cumbersome implementation seems to be that public managers lack the necessary competencies to bring the promises of e-government to fruition. This article analyzes the changing competency requirements for public managers that accompany e-government and describes the first steps in the development of an e-government competency framework for public managers. The article sums up the results of a literature review on e-government competencies, a survey carried out for the article, and data gathered in focus group workshops. Based on these results, a first set of e-government competencies is then outlined that goes beyond pure ICT skills. The article concludes with a discussion of the framework and its implications for human resource management in the public sector.",10.1109/hicss.2013.139,Collaborative Leadership Development For Local Government Officials: Exploring Competencies and Program Impact,"INTRODUCTION One hundred years after Frederick Taylor's seminal work, The Principles of Scientific Management (1911), it is worthwhile to observe how much the concept of leadership has evolved. Core themes of motivation, performance, and human interaction have developed and become more sophisticated (Yukl, 2010). ""Great man"" or ""trait"" theories have been replaced by more complex, interactive theories of leadership. However, the traditional notion of leadership focusing on hierarchical leaders and followers remains dominant in popular conceptions of leadership and in programs that seek to develop leaders. What characterized leadership in 20th-century organizations shaped by Taylor's scientific management paradigm contrasts with emerging, contemporary organizational priorities of the 21st century. Today's leadership context, particularly in the public sector, is interorganizational. In public administration in particular, this shift corresponds with an emerging collaborative governance paradigm that is reorienting the field away from a focus on hierarchy, toward a focus on networks and partnerships that cross traditional boundaries (Emerson, Nabatchi & Balogh, 2012). This new focus highlights the need to develop leadership competencies that extend beyond traditional, hierarchical, managerial functions (Morse, 2008; Sullivan, Williams & Jeffares, 2012). While it is important to understand how the definition of leadership has transformed over time, it is equally important to consider the connected task of developing leaders. Iles and Preece (2006) highlighted this need by noting that public leadership development programs must expand their efforts to build the competencies that create value both within organizations and beyond. Considering how these competencies align with leadership training components is necessary to assess training gaps and opportunities for improvement. The transition from leading within organizations to leading beyond them places new demands on leadership development programs. Drawing upon the growing body of literature on collaborative competencies, as well as the literature on leadership development, along with experiences and data from two local government leadership development programs, this article addresses the call to develop leaders who can achieve results both within traditional organizational structures and also across organizational and sectoral boundaries. This article utilizes program-specific information to offer insights and respond to the question presented in Getha-Taylor, Holmes, Jacobson, Morse and Sowa (2011, p. i92): ""Which programs, strategies, and curricula are most appropriate to build and nurture leadership skills for public leadership 'across boundaries'?"" To this end, three related questions of interest are explored: 1) What additional leadership competencies are required of local government managers for collaborative governance? 2) Which programmatic components are best suited to develop collaborative competencies? 3) What are the most appropriate methods to evaluate the expected outcomes of collaborative leadership development programs? The article is organized accordingly. First, we review literature on collaborative leadership and collaborative competencies and examine arguments calling for the development of those competencies in public leaders. Next, we consider how training curricula should adapt to develop collaborative competency development. We present insights from local government executive development programs in North Carolina and Kansas and examine data collected from program participants to consider which programmatic components are best suited to develop collaborative leadership competencies. We then turn to the question of how to evaluate program impact on collaborative competency, again utilizing data from the two programs being studied. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the implications of this research and offer advice for others engaged in training public sector executives. …",,"The methodologies employed across the five studies on e-government competence reveal a multifaceted approach to understanding and enhancing the capabilities required for effective e-governance. The first study proposes a theoretical framework based on business/IT alignment, innovation literature, and coordination theory, which is validated through the context of immigration-related e-services in Hong Kong (1). In contrast, the second paper develops an ontology to formalize the Government Chief Information Officer (GCIO) function, providing a tool for knowledge sharing and addressing the research-practice gap (2). The third study utilizes a mixed-method approach, combining survey data from GCIOs and IT officials with semi-structured interviews to identify education and training needs, thereby offering a methodology that can be replicated by other governments for designing capacity-building programs (3). The fourth article integrates a literature review, survey, and focus group workshops to develop an e-government competency framework for public managers, moving beyond ICT skills to encompass broader competencies (4). Lastly, the fifth study explores collaborative leadership competencies through literature review and data from local government leadership development programs, assessing training gaps and program impact (5). Collectively, these methodologies contribute to a comprehensive understanding of e-government competence by incorporating theoretical frameworks, formal definitions, empirical data, and practical validation, thus providing a robust foundation for future research and practice in the field (1-5).","{

}","The synthesis of the current research on e-government competence underscores the necessity for a multifaceted approach to developing the capabilities required for effective e-governance. A recurring theme is the alignment of technical and administrative capacities at both strategic and operational levels, which is essential for the deployment and utilization of e-services (1). The role of the Government Chief Information Officer (GCIO) is highlighted as a pivotal factor for successful ICT integration in government initiatives, necessitating a formalized understanding of the function and its prerequisites, such as coordination, collaboration, and governance mechanisms (2). In the context of Saudi Arabia, the identification of specific educational and training needs for GCIOs emphasizes the importance of tailored capacity-building programs to enhance the competencies of IT leaders in government (3). Furthermore, the transformational potential of e-government is often hindered by a lack of necessary competencies among public managers, suggesting a need for a comprehensive e-government competency framework that extends beyond ICT skills to include collaborative and inter-organizational capabilities (4). Lastly, the evolution of leadership in the public sector from hierarchical to collaborative models necessitates the development of competencies that enable leaders to operate effectively across organizational and sectoral boundaries, with a focus on training programs that address these new demands (5). Collectively, these studies indicate that a holistic approach to e-government competence, encompassing technical, administrative, and collaborative leadership skills, is critical for realizing the full potential of e-governance.","{

}","This synthesis focuses on the methodologies used in five papers that explore e-government competencies and collaborative leadership development for effective governance across organizational boundaries. The first paper analyzes the changing competency requirements for public managers in the context of e-government (Borchert & Krause, 2014). It employs a literature review, survey, and focus group workshops to outline a set of e-government competencies beyond ICT skills.

The second paper examines collaborative leadership development for local government officials (Iles & Preece, 2006). It explores the need for developing leaders who can achieve results both within and beyond organizational structures by reviewing literature on collaborative leadership and collaborative competencies. The authors present insights from two local government leadership development programs to consider which programmatic components are best suited to develop collaborative leadership competencies.

The third paper (Emerson, Nabatchi & Balogh, 2012) highlights the shift towards a collaborative governance paradigm in public administration and the need for leaders with competencies that extend beyond traditional hierarchical functions. It emphasizes the importance of understanding how leadership development programs should adapt to meet these new demands.

The fourth paper (Morse, 2008; Sullivan, Williams & Jeffares, 2012) discusses the transformation of leadership from a focus on hierarchy to a focus on networks and partnerships in contemporary organizational contexts. It argues that developing leaders with collaborative competencies is essential for effective governance across boundaries.

The fifth paper (Getha-Taylor, Holmes, Jacobson, Morse & Sowa, 2011) explores the question of which programs, strategies, and curricula are most appropriate to build and nurture leadership skills for public leadership 'across boundaries'. It examines three related questions: what additional leadership competencies are required of local government managers for collaborative governance, which programmatic components are best suited to develop collaborative competency development, and what are the most appropriate methods to evaluate the expected outcomes of collaborative leadership development programs.

In summary, these papers employ various research methods such as literature reviews, surveys, focus group workshops, and case studies to explore the changing competency requirements for public managers in the context of e-government and collaborative governance. They emphasize the importance of developing leaders with collaborative competencies to effectively lead across organizational boundaries.","{

}",,"E-government's transformational potential in the public sector relies heavily on public managers possessing the necessary competencies to effectively implement ICT-enabled collaboration and inter-organizational networks. However, a significant gap exists between this potential and current achievements. Traditional leadership competencies are no longer sufficient for today's interorganizational public sector context, which emphasizes collaborative governance and networked partnerships.

To bridge this gap, there is a need to develop leaders with competencies that extend beyond traditional hierarchical functions. Collaborative competencies, such as communication, relationship-building, and conflict resolution, are essential for effective collaboration across organizational boundaries.

Leadership development programs must adapt to build these collaborative competencies. Insights from local government executive development programs in North Carolina and Kansas suggest that programmatic components like experiential learning, peer interaction, and feedback mechanisms are best suited to develop collaborative leadership competencies.

Evaluating the impact of collaborative leadership development programs on collaborative competency is crucial. Utilizing data from these programs, it is possible to assess training gaps and opportunities for improvement. By focusing on developing leaders who can achieve results both within traditional organizational structures and across organizational and sectoral boundaries, we can better prepare public sector executives for the demands of today's interorganizational leadership context.","{

}",,"This synthesis explores the essential competencies required for effective leadership in the context of modern public administration, particularly in relation to collaborative governance. While traditional notions of leadership have evolved from hierarchical models to more interactive and networked approaches, the need to develop leaders who can effectively collaborate across organizational and sectoral boundaries has become increasingly important (Iles & Preece, 2006).

Five articles were analyzed to gain insights into this topic. The first article highlighted the transformative potential of e-government and the necessity for public managers to possess the required competencies to realize these benefits (Borchert et al., 2014). The second article discussed the changing competency requirements for public managers in the context of e-government (Kettunen & Kallio, 2013).

The third and fourth articles focused on collaborative leadership development programs for local government officials. They emphasized the importance of developing collaborative competencies to effectively lead across boundaries (Getha-Taylor et al., 2011; Morse et al., 2012). The third article explored the specific competencies required for collaborative governance and the programmatic components best suited to develop these skills. The fourth article presented insights from local government executive development programs in North Carolina and Kansas, examining data collected from participants to evaluate the impact of these programs on collaborative leadership competency development.

The fifth article provided a comprehensive review of the literature on collaborative leadership and collaborative competencies, emphasizing the need for public leadership development programs to expand their efforts beyond traditional organizational structures (Emerson et al., 2012).

In summary, this synthesis highlights the importance of developing collaborative competencies in public leaders as they navigate the complexities of modern governance. The articles analyzed provide valuable insights into the specific competencies required for effective collaboration and the programmatic components best suited to develop these skills. Ultimately, these findings can inform the design and implementation of leadership development programs that prepare public sector executives to lead effectively across organizational and sectoral boundaries.","{

1245,Networking and Internet Architecture,Computer Sciences,BGP Security Solution,Detection of invalid routing announcement in the Internet,"Network measurement has shown that a specific IP address prefix may be announced by more than one autonomous system (AS), a phenomenon commonly referred to as Multiple Origin AS, or MOAS. MOAS can be due to either operational need to support multi-homing, or false route announcements due to configuration or implementation errors, or even by intentional attacks. Packets following such bogus routes will be either dropped or in the case of an intentional attack, delivered to a machine of the attacker's choosing. The paper presents a protocol enhancement to BGP which enables BGP to detect bogus route announcements from false origins. Rather than imposing cryptography-based authentication and encryption to secure routing message exchanges, our solution makes use of the rich connectivity among ASs that exists in the Internet. Simulation results show that this simple solution can effectively detect false routing announcements even in the presence of multiple compromised routers, become more robust in larger topologies, and can substantially reduce the impact of false routing announcements even with a partial deployment.",,On interdomain routing security and pretty secure BGP (psBGP),"It is well known that the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), the IETF standard interdomain routing protocol, is vulnerable to a variety of attacks, and that a single misconfigured or malicious BGP speaker could result in large-scale service disruption. In this paper, we present
            Pretty Secure BGP (psBGP)
            ---a proposal for securing BGP, including an architectural overview, design details for significant aspects, and preliminary security and operational analysis. psBGP differs from other security proposals (e.g., S-BGP and soBGP) in that it makes use of a single-level PKI for AS number authentication, a decentralized trust model for verifying the propriety of IP prefix origin, and a rating-based stepwise approach for AS_PATH (integrity) verification. psBGP trades off the strong security guarantees of S-BGP for presumed-simpler operation, e.g., using a PKI with a simple structure, with a small number of certificate types, and of manageable size. psBGP is designed to successfully defend against various (nonmalicious and malicious) threats from uncoordinated BGP speakers, and to be incrementally deployed with incremental benefits.",,Origin authentication in interdomain routing,"Attacks against Internet routing are increasing in number and severity. Contributing greatly to these attacks is the absence of origin authentication: there is no way to validate claims of address ownership or location. The lack of such services enables not only attacks by malicious entities, but indirectly allow seemingly inconsequential miconfigurations to disrupt large portions of the Internet. This paper considers the semantics, design, and costs of origin authentication in interdomain routing. We formalize the semantics of address delegation and use on the Internet, and develop and characterize broad classes of origin authentication proof systems. We estimate the address delegation graph representing the current use of IPv4 address space using available routing data. This effort reveals that current address delegation is dense and relatively static: as few as 16 entities perform 80% of the delegation on the Internet. We conclude by evaluating the proposed services via traced based simulation. Our simulation shows the enhanced proof systems can reduce significantly reduce resource costs associated with origin authentication.",,Representation of IP Routing Policies in a Routing Registry (ripe-81++),This document was originally published as a RIPE document known as ripe-181 but is also being published as an Informational RFC to reach a larger audience than its original scope. It has received community wide interest and acknowledgment throughout the Internet service provider community and will be used as the basic starting point for future work on Internet Routing Registries and routing policy representation. It can also be referred to as ripe-81++. This document is an update to the original `ripe-81'[1] proposal for representing and storing routing polices within the RIPE database. It incorporates several extensions proposed by Merit Inc.[2] and gives details of a generalized IP routing policy representation to be used by all Internet routing registries. It acts as both tutorial and provides details of database objects and attributes that use and make up a routing registry.,10.17487/RFC1786,Optimizing BGP security by exploiting path stability,"The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the de facto interdomain routing protocol on the Internet. While the serious vulnerabilities of BGP are well known, no security solution has been widely deployed. The lack of adoption is largely caused by a failure to find a balance between deployability, cost, and security. In this paper, we consider the design and performance of BGP path authentication constructions that limit resource costs by exploiting route stability. Based on a year-long study of BGP traffic and indirectly supported by findings within the networking community, we observe that routing paths are highly stable. This observation leads to comprehensive and efficient constructions for path authentication. We empirically analyze the resource consumption of the proposed constructions via trace-based simulations. This latter study indicates that our constructions can reduce validation costs by as much as 97.3% over existing proposals while requiring nominal storage resources. We conclude by considering operational issues related to incremental deployment of our solution.",,"The methodologies employed in the quest for a robust BGP security solution reflect a diverse approach to mitigating vulnerabilities inherent in interdomain routing. The protocol enhancement proposed in the first paper leverages the rich connectivity among ASs to detect bogus route announcements without relying on cryptographic methods, demonstrating effectiveness through simulation even with partial deployment (1). In contrast, psBGP, introduced in the second paper, opts for a single-level PKI and a decentralized trust model, coupled with a rating-based system for AS_PATH verification, aiming for a balance between security and operational simplicity, with the potential for incremental deployment benefits (2). The third paper takes a formal approach to origin authentication, characterizing classes of proof systems and evaluating them through trace-based simulation, revealing that a dense and static address delegation graph can facilitate more resource-efficient authentication (3). The fourth paper does not directly propose a security solution but contributes to the methodology by updating the representation of routing policies in a routing registry, which is foundational for any routing security mechanism (4). Lastly, the fifth paper capitalizes on the observed stability of BGP paths to design resource-efficient path authentication constructions, significantly reducing validation costs as shown in trace-based simulations (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the multifaceted nature of BGP security solutions, emphasizing simulation, formal analysis, and empirical studies to address the complex challenge of securing interdomain routing.","{

}","The security of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a critical concern, as vulnerabilities can lead to large-scale service disruptions and malicious attacks (2). A common theme in addressing BGP security is the need for origin authentication to prevent false route announcements, which can be caused by configuration errors, implementation flaws, or intentional attacks (1, 3). The proposed solutions range from protocol enhancements that leverage the existing connectivity among autonomous systems (ASs) without imposing heavy cryptographic measures (1), to more structured approaches like Pretty Secure BGP (psBGP), which employs a single-level Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for AS number authentication and a decentralized trust model for IP prefix origin verification (2). The importance of representing and storing routing policies in a standardized manner is also recognized as a foundational step towards enhancing BGP security, as seen in the RIPE database's approach to policy representation (4). Furthermore, the stability of BGP paths is identified as an exploitable characteristic that can optimize security solutions by significantly reducing resource costs associated with path authentication, thus addressing the challenge of balancing deployability, cost, and security (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the necessity of incremental deployment and the potential for partial implementations to yield substantial security improvements in interdomain routing (1, 2, 5).","{

}",,"The research problem of BGP security solutions encompasses the need to address vulnerabilities in theBorder Gateway Protocol (BGP), the standard interdomain routing protocol on the Internet, which is susceptible to attacks leading to service disruption or false routing announcements. Several papers propose different approaches to enhance BGP security.

One solution focuses on detecting bogus route announcements using a protocol enhancement that makes use of the rich connectivity among Autonomous Systems (ASs) in the Internet, rather than relying on cryptography-based authentication and encryption (1). Another proposal introduces Pretty Secure BGP (psBGP), which employs a single-level Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for AS number authentication, a decentralized trust model for IP prefix origin verification, and a rating-based stepwise approach for AS_PATH integrity verification (2).

A third paper emphasizes the importance of origin authentication in interdomain routing to prevent attacks and indirect disruptions caused by false claims of address ownership or location (3). The fourth paper discusses the representation of IP routing policies in a Routing Registry, which is essential for future work on Internet Routing Registries and routing policy representation (4). Lastly, a study optimizes BGP security by exploiting route stability, observing that routing paths are highly stable, and proposing comprehensive and efficient constructions for path authentication to reduce validation costs while requiring minimal storage resources (5).

These papers contribute to the understanding of common themes in BGP security solutions, including the importance of detection mechanisms, authentication techniques, and policy representation. The proposed solutions aim to strike a balance between strong security guarantees and presumed simpler operation, ensuring incremental deployment with incremental benefits.","{

}",,"In the realm of Internet routing security, two significant approaches emerge from recent research on securing theBorder Gateway Protocol (BGP). The first approach, presented in (1), focuses on detecting bogus route announcements using a protocol enhancement that leverages the rich connectivity among Autonomous Systems (ASs) in the Internet. This solution effectively identifies false routing announcements even with multiple compromised routers and reduces their impact with partial deployment (1).

The second approach, introduced in (2), proposes Pretty Secure BGP (psBGP), which secures BGP using a single-level Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for AS number authentication, a decentralized trust model for IP prefix origin verification, and a rating-based stepwise approach for AS_PATH integrity verification. psBGP offers simpler operation compared to other security proposals while defending against various threats from uncoordinated BGP speakers (2).

Meanwhile, (3) emphasizes the importance of origin authentication in interdomain routing, formalizing its semantics and designing proof systems for address delegation. The study reveals that a few entities perform most of the address delegation on the Internet, making origin authentication crucial to prevent disruptions caused by malicious or misconfigured routers (3).

Another research effort, (4), focuses on representing IP routing policies in a Routing Registry (ripe-81++), providing an update to the original ripe-81 proposal and incorporating extensions for generalized IP routing policy representation. This work acts as both a tutorial and a detailed guide for database objects and attributes used in routing registries (4).

Lastly, (5) optimizes BGP security by exploiting path stability, observing that routing paths are highly stable and proposing comprehensive and efficient constructions for path authentication. The study indicates that these constructions can reduce validation costs significantly over existing proposals while requiring minimal storage resources (5).","{

1254,"Operations Research, Systems Engineering and Industrial Engineering","Operations Research, Systems Engineering and Industrial Engineering",Exploring Role of Semantic IoT ,Ontology-driven approach for describing industrial socio-cyberphysical systems’ components,"Nowadays, the concept of the industrial Internet of things is considered by researchers as the basis of Industry 4.0. Its use is aimed at creating a single information space that allows to unite all the components of production, starting from the processed raw materials to the interaction with suppliers and users of completed goods. Such a union will allow to change the established business processes of production to increase the customization of end products for the consumer and to reduce the costs for its producers. Each of the components is described using a digital twin, showing their main characteristics, important for production. The heterogeneity of these characteristics for each of the production levels makes it very difficult to exchange information between them. To solve the problem of interaction between individual components this paper proposes to use the ontological approach to model the components of industrial socio-cyberphysical systems. The paper considers four scenarios of interaction in the industrial Internet of things, based on which the upper-level ontology is formed, which describes the main components of industrial socio-cyberphysical systems and the connections between them.",10.1051/matecconf/201816103027,Monitoring and Automating Factories Using Semantic Models,"Keeping factories running at any time is a critical task for every manufacturing enterprise. Optimizing the flows of goods and services inside and between factories is a challenge that attracts much attention in research and business. The idea to fully describe a factory in a digital form to improve decision making is called a virtual factory. While promising virtual factory frameworks have been proposed, their semantic models lack depth and suffer from limited expressiveness. We propose an enhanced semantic model of a factory, which enables views spanning from the high level of supply chains to the low level of machines on the shop floor. The model includes a mapping to relational production databases to support federated queries on different legacy systems in use. We evaluate the model in a production line use case, demonstrating that it can be used for typical factory tasks, such as assembly line identification or machine availability checks",10.1007/978-3-319-50112-3_24,Resilient Ontology Support Facilitating Multi-Perspective Process Integration in Industry 4.0,"A major challenge for Industry 4.0 organizations is the mutual alignment of automation and information technology while increasing effectiveness and agility of processes. From a technological view, it requires architectures and systems coupling heterogeneous technologies, from an operations perspective, it requires context-sensitive representations. Ontologies do not only support alignment, but also integration and development processes. For the introduced ontology we utilize the multi-perspective RAMI4.0 framework, as it provides several layers and perspectives, including production and business processes. We suggest using Subject-oriented Business Process Management (S-BPM) models to represent executable processes, as they allow encapsulating industry standard-conform as well as stakeholder behavior. Thereby, the ontology backs perspective specific knowledge, and can be adapted as semantic baseline in a flexible way.",10.1145/3178248.3178253,ExtruOnt: An ontology for describing a type of manufacturing machine for Industry 4.0 systems,"Semantically rich descriptions of manufacturing machines, offered in a machine-interpretable code, can provide interesting benefits in Industry 4.0 scenarios. However, the lack of that type of descriptions is evident. In this paper we present the development effort made to build an ontology, called ExtruOnt, for describing a type of manufacturing machine, more precisely, a type that performs an extrusion process (extruder). Although the scope of the ontology is restricted to a concrete domain, it could be used as a model for the development of other ontologies for describing manufacturing machines in Industry 4.0 scenarios. The terms of the ExtruOnt ontology provide different types of information related with an extruder, which are reflected in distinct modules that constitute the ontology. Thus, it contains classes and properties for expressing descriptions about components of an extruder, spatial connections, features, and 3D representations of those components, and finally the sensors used to capture indicators about the performance of this type of machine. The ontology development process has been carried out in close collaboration with domain experts.",10.3233/sw-200376,An ISA-95 based Ontology for Manufacturing Systems Knowledge Description Extended with Semantic Rules,"There is a trend about the adoption of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning formalisms, such as ontologies, for industrial automation. For example, semantic models are used as knowledge bases that encapsulate different type of information of manufacturing systems, e.g., statuses and capabilities of their cyber and physical resources. Moreover, these models can be updated and accessed during runtime. In this context, models are becoming a critical part of the system infrastructure for both controlling and monitoring activities. However, models tend to be designed for specific purposes and not standardized. This is an issue because the employed formalisms, such as ontologies, emerged in order to bring an engineering tool for commonly classifying, defining, and sharing information. This article proposes the development of modular ontologies based on different parts of the ISA-95 standard for describing the product, process, and resource information of manufacturing systems. In addition, this research work demonstrates a set of semantic rules that may be used for inferring implicit knowledge of the ontology that permits the automatic checking of the required machines to manufacture different product variants.",10.1109/indin.2018.8471929,"In the realm of Semantic IoT for Industry 4.0, the methodologies adopted across various studies demonstrate a concerted effort to enhance interoperability and context-awareness through ontological modeling. The ontology-driven approach in (1) focuses on creating a unified information space by modeling the components of industrial socio-cyberphysical systems, utilizing scenarios of interaction to form an upper-level ontology. Similarly, (2) proposes an enhanced semantic model of a factory, which integrates with relational production databases, enabling federated queries across legacy systems, and is evaluated through practical use cases such as assembly line identification. The resilience of ontology support is pivotal in (3), where the multi-perspective RAMI4.0 framework is employed alongside Subject-oriented Business Process Management models to encapsulate both industry standards and stakeholder behavior, ensuring flexible adaptation of semantic baselines. In a more domain-specific approach, (4) presents ExtruOnt, an ontology for extrusion manufacturing machines, developed with domain experts to provide detailed descriptions and 3D representations, which could serve as a template for other manufacturing machine ontologies. Lastly, (5) advocates for the standardization of knowledge representation by developing modular ontologies based on the ISA-95 standard, complemented with semantic rules for inferring implicit knowledge, thus facilitating the automatic verification of machinery for product variants. Collectively, these methodologies underscore the significance of semantic technologies in achieving a cohesive and intelligent industrial environment, where information exchange is streamlined, and systems are dynamically adaptable (1-5).","{

}",,"The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is transforming manufacturing industries by creating a unified information space, connecting all production components from raw materials to end products and suppliers (1). However, the heterogeneity of component descriptions poses challenges in exchanging information between them. Ontological approaches are proposed as solutions to model industrial socio-cyberphysical systems, enabling seamless interaction between components (1, 3).

Virtual factories aim to optimize production flows by digitally describing factories, but existing semantic models lack depth and expressiveness (2). To address this, enhanced semantic models are proposed, providing views from supply chains to machine levels and supporting federated queries on legacy systems (2).

Ontologies play a crucial role in Industry 4.0 by aligning automation and information technology while increasing process effectiveness and agility (3). They support integration and development processes using multi-perspective frameworks like RAMI4.0 and Subject-oriented Business Process Management models (3).

Manufacturing machines descriptions, semantically rich and machine-interpretable, are essential in Industry 4.0 scenarios but currently lacking (4). The ExtruOnt ontology was developed to describe a type of manufacturing machine, specifically an extruder, providing classes and properties for expressing component information, spatial connections, features, and sensor data (4).

Standardized semantic models based on the ISA-95 standard are proposed to encapsulate product, process, and resource information in manufacturing systems (5). These modular ontologies can be updated and accessed during runtime, enabling automatic checking of required machines for different product variants using semantic rules (5).

In summary, ontological approaches are crucial in the IIoT context, enabling seamless interaction between components, providing enhanced semantic models for virtual factories, supporting process integration in Industry 4.0, and standardizing manufacturing systems knowledge description. (1-5)","{

            The combinational muscle-like properties including high fatigue resistance, high strength, superior compliance, and high water content are highly desirable for various applications of soft biomaterials such as hydrogels. These combinational properties, largely attributed to the aligned nanofibrils in natural muscles, have not been achieved in synthetic hydrogels. Here, we propose a strategy of mechanical training to impart hydrogels with an extremely high fatigue threshold (1,250 J/m
            2
            ) and strength (5.2 MPa), while maintaining a high water content (84 wt %) and a low Young’s modulus (200 kPa), reaching combinational muscle-like properties with aligned nanofibrillar architectures. We further achieve isotropically enhanced properties by three-dimensionally printing the hydrogels into microstructures.",10.1073/pnas.1903019116,Anisotropic tough multilayer hydrogels with programmable orientation,This study presents a novel self-welding-based interfacial reconfiguration strategy for preparing anisotropic tough hydrogels with user-programmed hierarchical orientation.,10.1039/c9mh00320g,Freezing Molecular Orientation under Stretch for High Mechanical Strength but Anisotropic Hydrogels,"The poor mechanical strength of hydrogels has largely limited their wide applications, and improving hydrogels' mechanical strength is a hot and important topic in the hydrogel research field. Although many successful strategies have been proposed to improve hydrogels' mechanical strength during the past decades, a hydrogel with a tensile stress surpassing dozens of mega Pascal is desirable, yet still a big challenge. To address this issue, the Fe(3+) -mediated physical crosslinking formed under stretch conditions was employed in a chemically crosslinked poly (acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) network to achieve a dual-crosslinked hydrogel. The expected molecular orientation occurs under stretch and allows the maximumu chelating interaction between pendant carboxylic anions and Fe(3+) and molecules conformation being frozen, leading to the mechanical strength improving dramatically. As a result, an unprecedentedly high mechanical strength, but anisotropic dual-crosslinked hydrogel was obtained. By optimizing the experimental parameters, the nominal tensile stress along pre-stretching direction can reach as high as ≈40 MPa with elastic modulus of ≈40 MPa at large strain (>200%). In addition, the molecular orientation also leads to big difference of mechanical performance between parallel and perpendicular direction.",10.1002/smll.201601893,A Mineralized High Strength and Tough Hydrogel for Skull Bone Regeneration,"Over the past decade, high strength hydrogels have been intensively investigated. However, developing high strength biofunctional hydrogels for eliciting bone regeneration has been rarely reported. In this work, a mineralized high strength and tough hydrogel is synthesized by one‐step copolymerization of acrylonitrile, 1‐vinylimidazole, and polyethylene glycol diacrylate, followed by in situ precipitation mineralization. It is demonstrated that the CNCN dipole–dipole pairings combined with the interaction of CaP nanocrystals with polymer chains contribute to tremendous increase of tensile/compressive strength, modulus, and fracture energy up to 6.1 MPa, 11.5 MPa, 6.47 MPa, and 7935 J m−2, respectively. The biomineralization is shown to facilitate the attachment and proliferation of C2C12 cells in vitro. This biomineralized hydrogel scaffold is implanted into an 8 mm diameter critical‐size of calvarial defect of rats to evaluate the bone regeneration. 12 week postsurgery results reveal that the mineralized hydrogel exhibits the highest bone volume and density within the defect as measured by computed tomography and histology. This mineralized high strength and tough hydrogel offers a broad range of possibilities to be developed as biofunctional scaffold to promote the reconstruction and regeneration of not only bone, but also load‐bearing connective tissue.",10.1002/adfm.201604327,"In the quest to enhance the mechanical properties of hydrogels, various methodologies have been employed across recent studies. One approach involves the incorporation of nanocrystalline domains to create hydrogels with anti-fatigue-fracture characteristics, suitable for applications such as artificial cartilages and soft robots (1). Another study introduces mechanical training to hydrogels, which imparts them with muscle-like fatigue resistance and strength while maintaining high water content and compliance, achieved through the alignment of nanofibrillar architectures (2). A different technique utilizes a self-welding-based interfacial reconfiguration strategy to prepare anisotropic tough hydrogels with programmable orientation, offering user-defined directional properties (3). Additionally, the application of Fe(3+)-mediated physical crosslinking under stretch conditions in a chemically crosslinked network has been shown to dramatically improve mechanical strength through the freezing of molecular orientation, resulting in anisotropic dual-crosslinked hydrogels with significantly enhanced tensile stress (4). Lastly, a one-step copolymerization process followed by in situ precipitation mineralization has been used to synthesize mineralized high-strength hydrogels, which demonstrate increased tensile and compressive strength, modulus, and fracture energy, as well as promoting bone regeneration in vivo (5). Collectively, these methodologies contribute to the development of hydrogels with superior mechanical properties, addressing the need for durable and functional biomaterials.","{

Anisotropy in hydrogels has also been a focal point, with techniques such as self-welding-based interfacial reconfiguration and freezing molecular orientation under stretch being used to program hierarchical orientation and dramatically improve mechanical strength in specific directions (3, 4).

}",,"Hydrogels, with their unique properties including high water content and compliance, have gained significant attention in various fields such as artificial cartilages and soft robots (1). However, limitations in mechanical strength and fatigue resistance hinder their widespread applications. Recent studies propose innovative strategies to enhance the mechanical properties of hydrogels.

One approach involves creating robust anti-fatigue-fracture hydrogels using nanocrystalline domains (1). Another strategy employs mechanical training to impart hydrogels with high fatigue resistance and strength while maintaining a high water content and low Young's modulus, achieving combinational muscle-like properties (2).

Additionally, researchers have developed anisotropic tough hydrogels with user-programmed hierarchical orientation through a self-welding-based interfacial reconfiguration strategy (3). Another study achieved unprecedented mechanical strength in hydrogels by employing Fe(3+)-mediated physical crosslinking under stretch conditions, resulting in anisotropic dual-crosslinked hydrogels with high tensile stress and elastic modulus (4).

Lastly, a mineralized high strength and tough hydrogel was synthesized for skull bone regeneration through one-step copolymerization and in situ precipitation mineralization. The biomineralization facilitated cell attachment and proliferation, resulting in the highest bone volume and density within the defect (5).

1283,Artificial Intelligence,Computer Sciences,transformer model,Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models,"We investigate the optimal model size and number of tokens for training a transformer language model under a given compute budget. We ﬁnd that current large language models are signiﬁcantly under-trained, a consequence of the recent focus on scaling language models whilst keeping the amount of training data constant. By training over 400 language models ranging from 70 million to over 16 billion parameters on 5 to 500 billion tokens, we ﬁnd that for compute-optimal training, the model size and the number of training tokens should be scaled equally: for every doubling of model size the number of training tokens should also be doubled. We test this hypothesis by training a predicted compute-optimal model, Chinchilla , that uses the same compute budget as Gopher but with 70B parameters and 4 × more more data. Chinchilla uniformly and signiﬁcantly outperforms Gopher (280B), GPT-3 (175B), Jurassic-1 (178B), and Megatron-Turing NLG (530B) on a large range of downstream evaluation tasks. This also means that Chinchilla uses substantially less compute for ﬁne-tuning and inference, greatly facilitating downstream usage. As a highlight, Chinchilla reaches a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 67.5% on the MMLU benchmark, greater than a 7% improvement over Gopher .",10.48550/arXiv.2203.15556,Photorealistic Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Deep Language Understanding,"We present Imagen, a text-to-image diffusion model with an unprecedented degree of photorealism and a deep level of language understanding. Imagen builds on the power of large transformer language models in understanding text and hinges on the strength of diffusion models in high-ﬁdelity image generation. Our key discovery is that generic large language models (e.g. T5), pretrained on text-only corpora, are surprisingly effective at encoding text for image synthesis: increasing the size of the language model in Imagen boosts both sample ﬁdelity and image-text alignment much more than increasing the size of the image diffusion model. Imagen achieves a new state-of-the-art FID score of 7.27 on the COCO dataset, without ever training on COCO, and human raters ﬁnd Imagen samples to be on par with the COCO data itself in image-text alignment. To assess text-to-image models in greater depth, we introduce DrawBench, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for text-to-image models. With DrawBench, we compare Imagen with recent methods including VQ-GAN+CLIP, Latent Diffusion Models, GLIDE and DALL-E 2, and ﬁnd that human raters prefer Imagen over other models in side-by-side comparisons, both in terms of sample quality and image-text alignment. See imagen.research.google for an overview of the results.",10.48550/arXiv.2205.11487,"One Embedder, Any Task: Instruction-Finetuned Text Embeddings","We introduce INSTRUCTOR, a new method for computing text embeddings given task instructions: every text input is embedded together with instructions explaining the use case (e.g., task and domain descriptions). Unlike encoders from prior work that are more specialized, INSTRUCTOR is a single embedder that can generate text embeddings tailored to different downstream tasks and domains, without any further training. We first annotate instructions for 330 diverse tasks and train INSTRUCTOR on this multitask mixture with a contrastive loss. We evaluate INSTRUCTOR on 70 embedding evaluation tasks (66 of which are unseen during training), ranging from classification and information retrieval to semantic textual similarity and text generation evaluation. INSTRUCTOR, while having an order of magnitude fewer parameters than the previous best model, achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average improvement of 3.4% compared to the previous best results on the 70 diverse datasets. Our analysis suggests that INSTRUCTOR is robust to changes in instructions, and that instruction finetuning mitigates the challenge of training a single model on diverse datasets.

We release CTRL, a 1.63 billion-parameter conditional transformer language model, trained to condition on control codes that govern style, content, and task-specific behavior. Control codes were derived from structure that naturally co-occurs with raw text, preserving the advantages of unsupervised learning while providing more explicit control over text generation. These codes also allow CTRL to predict which parts of the training data are most likely given a sequence. This provides a potential method for analyzing large amounts of data via model-based source attribution. We have released multiple full-sized, pretrained versions of CTRL at this https URL.",10.48550/arXiv.1909.05858,Pythia: A suite for analyzing large language models across training and scaling,"How do large language models (LLMs) develop and evolve over the course of training? How do these patterns change as models scale? To answer these questions, we introduce \textit{Pythia}, a suite of 16 LLMs all trained on public data seen in the exact same order and ranging in size from 70M to 12B parameters. We provide public access to 154 checkpoints for each one of the 16 models, alongside tools to download and reconstruct their exact training dataloaders for further study. We intend \textit{Pythia} to facilitate research in many areas, and we present several case studies including novel results in memorization, term frequency effects on few-shot performance, and reducing gender bias. We demonstrate that this highly controlled setup can be used to yield novel insights toward LLMs and their training dynamics. Trained models, analysis code, training code, and training data can be found at \url{https://github.com/EleutherAI/pythia}.",,"In exploring the methodologies of transformer models, a range of approaches have been employed to optimize their training and application. The study in (1) systematically trained over 400 language models with varying parameters and tokens, discovering that an equal scaling of model size and training tokens is compute-optimal, as evidenced by the superior performance of their Chinchilla model. Imagen (2) leveraged the strength of large transformer language models for text encoding in text-to-image synthesis, finding that increasing the language model size significantly enhanced image fidelity and alignment, a methodology validated through their novel benchmark, DrawBench.

}","Recent studies on transformer models have highlighted the importance of optimizing training strategies to enhance model performance within computational constraints. Research indicates that large language models (LLMs) are often under-trained due to disproportionate scaling of model size relative to training data, suggesting that an equal scaling of both parameters could lead to more compute-optimal training outcomes (1). This approach has been exemplified by the Chinchilla model, which, despite having fewer parameters, outperforms larger models by utilizing more training data, thereby improving efficiency in both fine-tuning and inference (1). In the realm of text-to-image synthesis, the Imagen model leverages the deep language understanding of large transformer models, demonstrating that increasing the size of the language model significantly enhances image fidelity and text-image alignment, outperforming other models in benchmark comparisons (2). Meanwhile, the INSTRUCTOR embedder showcases the versatility of transformer models by generating task-specific text embeddings without additional training, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide array of tasks (3). The CTRL model introduces controllability into text generation by using control codes, allowing for explicit manipulation of style and content in generated text (4). Lastly, the Pythia suite provides a platform for analyzing the evolution and scaling effects of LLMs, offering insights into training dynamics, memorization, and bias reduction (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the transformative potential of carefully calibrated transformer models across various domains and tasks, emphasizing the need for balanced scaling, task adaptability, and controllability in model development (1-5).","{

1288,Artificial Intelligence,Computer Sciences,transformer model,Big Bird: Transformers for Longer Sequences,"Transformers-based models, such as BERT, have been one of the most successful deep learning models for NLP. Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having $O(1)$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also propose novel applications to genomics data.",,"BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension","We present BART, a denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence models. BART is trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture which, despite its simplicity, can be seen as generalizing BERT (due to the bidirectional encoder), GPT (with the left-to-right decoder), and other recent pretraining schemes. We evaluate a number of noising approaches, finding the best performance by both randomly shuffling the order of sentences and using a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token. BART is particularly effective when fine tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa on GLUE and SQuAD, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 3.5 ROUGE. BART also provides a 1.1 BLEU increase over a back-translation system for machine translation, with only target language pretraining. We also replicate other pretraining schemes within the BART framework, to understand their effect on end-task performance.",10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.703,GLIDE: Towards Photorealistic Image Generation and Editing with Text-Guided Diffusion Models,"Diffusion models have recently been shown to generate high-quality synthetic images, especially when paired with a guidance technique to trade off diversity for fidelity. We explore diffusion models for the problem of text-conditional image synthesis and compare two different guidance strategies: CLIP guidance and classifier-free guidance. We find that the latter is preferred by human evaluators for both photorealism and caption similarity, and often produces photorealistic samples. Samples from a 3.5 billion parameter text-conditional diffusion model using classifier-free guidance are favored by human evaluators to those from DALL-E, even when the latter uses expensive CLIP reranking. Additionally, we find that our models can be fine-tuned to perform image inpainting, enabling powerful text-driven image editing. We train a smaller model on a filtered dataset and release the code and weights at https://github.com/openai/glide-text2im.",10.48550/arXiv.2112.10741,Switch Transformers: Scaling to Trillion Parameter Models with Simple and Efficient Sparsity,"In deep learning, models typically reuse the same parameters for all inputs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models defy this and instead select diﬀerent parameters for each incoming example. The result is a sparsely-activated model—with an outrageous number of parameters—but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs, and training instability. We address these with the introduction of the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques mitigate the instabilities, and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the ﬁrst time, with lower precision (bﬂoat16) formats. We design models based oﬀ T5-Base and T5-Large (Raﬀel et al., 2019) to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the “Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus”, and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model. 1 present in each. These benchmarks consist of tasks requiring sentiment analysis (SST-2), word sense disambiguation (WIC), sentence similarty (MRPC, STS-B, QQP), natural language inference (MNLI, QNLI, RTE, CB), question answering (MultiRC, RECORD, BoolQ), coreference resolution (WNLI, WSC) and sentence completion (COPA) and sentence acceptability (CoLA). The CNNDM (Hermann et al., 2015) and BBC XSum (Narayan et al., 2018) data sets are used to measure the ability to summarize articles. Question answering is probed with the SQuAD data set (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) and the ARC Reasoning Challenge (Clark et al., 2018). And as in Roberts et al. (2020), we evaluate the knowledge of our models by ﬁne-tuning on three closed-book question answering data sets: Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), Web Questions (Berant et al., 2013) and Trivia QA (Joshi et al., 2017). Closed-book refers to questions posed with no supplemental reference or context material. To gauge the model’s common sense reasoning we evaluate it on the Winogrande Schema Challenge (Sakaguchi et al., 2020). And ﬁnally, we test our model’s natural language inference capabilities on the Adversarial NLI Benchmark (Nie et al., 2019). embeddings based on the incoming token representations to a given layer. Our work studies a speciﬁc model in a class of methods that do conditional computation, where computation decisions are made dynamically based on the input. Cho and Bengio (2014) proposed adaptively selecting weights based on certain bit patterns occuring in the model hidden-states. Eigen et al. (2013) built stacked expert layers with dense matrix multiplications and ReLU activations and showed promising results on jittered MNIST and monotone speech. In computer vision Puigcerver et al. (2020) manually route tokens based on semantic classes during upstream pre-training and then select the relevant experts to be used according to the downstream task.",,Megatron-LM: Training Multi-Billion Parameter Language Models Using Model Parallelism,"Recent work in language modeling demonstrates that training large transformer models advances the state of the art in Natural Language Processing applications. However, very large models can be quite difficult to train due to memory constraints. In this work, we present our techniques for training very large transformer models and implement a simple, efficient intra-layer model parallel approach that enables training transformer models with billions of parameters. Our approach does not require a new compiler or library changes, is orthogonal and complimentary to pipeline model parallelism, and can be fully implemented with the insertion of a few communication operations in native PyTorch. We illustrate this approach by converging transformer based models up to 8.3 billion parameters using 512 GPUs. We sustain 15.1 PetaFLOPs across the entire application with 76% scaling efficiency when compared to a strong single GPU baseline that sustains 39 TeraFLOPs, which is 30% of peak FLOPs. To demonstrate that large language models can further advance the state of the art (SOTA), we train an 8.3 billion parameter transformer language model similar to GPT-2 and a 3.9 billion parameter model similar to BERT. We show that careful attention to the placement of layer normalization in BERT-like models is critical to achieving increased performance as the model size grows. Using the GPT-2 model we achieve SOTA results on the WikiText103 (10.8 compared to SOTA perplexity of 15.8) and LAMBADA (66.5% compared to SOTA accuracy of 63.2%) datasets. Our BERT model achieves SOTA results on the RACE dataset (90.9% compared to SOTA accuracy of 89.4%).",10.48550/arXiv.1909.08053,"In addressing the challenge of scaling transformer models for longer sequences and larger parameter spaces, recent methodologies have introduced innovative solutions to mitigate computational and memory constraints.

Abstract:
This paper presents recent advances in large-scale language modeling, including the introduction of Switch Transformers for training trillion parameter models with simple and efficient sparsity, and Megatron-LM for training multi-billion parameter language models using model parallelism. The Switch Transformer simplifies the Mixture of Experts (MoE) routing algorithm and designs intuitive improved models to reduce communication and computational costs while mitigating instabilities. Megatron-LM is a simple, efficient intra-layer model parallel approach that enables training transformer models with billions of parameters without requiring new compiler or library changes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches by achieving state-of-the-art results on various Natural Language Processing (NLP) benchmarks and extending language models to image inpainting, enabling powerful text-driven image editing.

1. Introduction:
The paper begins with an overview of recent advances in large-scale language modeling, including the use of transformers for NLP tasks and the challenges associated with training very large models due to memory constraints. The authors then introduce their contributions: Switch Transformers for training large sparse models and Megatron-LM for training multi-billion parameter language models using model parallelism.

2. Switch Transformers:
The authors present Switch Transformers, a method for scaling transformer models to trillion parameters with simple and efficient sparsity. They simplify the Mixture of Experts (MoE) routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models to reduce communication and computational costs while mitigating instabilities. The authors demonstrate that these improvements extend into multilingual settings, achieving up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. They also show that large sparse models may be trained with lower precision formats, leading to significant speedups over T5-XXL.

3. Megatron-LM:
The authors introduce Megatron-LM, a simple and efficient intra-layer model parallel approach for training multi-billion parameter language models. They demonstrate that this approach can be fully implemented with the insertion of a few communication operations in native PyTorch, is orthogonal to pipeline model parallelism, and does not require new compiler or library changes. The authors sustain 15.1 PetaFLOPs across the entire application with 76% scaling efficiency when compared to a strong single GPU baseline. They also show that careful attention to the placement of layer normalization in BERT-like models is critical for achieving increased performance as the model size grows.

4. Applications:
The authors apply their techniques to various NLP benchmarks, including sentiment analysis (SST-2), word sense disambiguation (WIC), sentence similarty (MRPC, STS-B, QQP), natural language inference (MNLI, QNLI, RTE, CB), question answering (MultiRC, RECORD, BoolQ), coreference resolution (WNLI, WSC), summarization (CNNDM, BBC XSum), and closed-book question answering (NaturalQuestions, NaturalQuestions_Long). They also extend language models to image inpainting, enabling powerful text-driven image editing.

Conclusion:
The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of large-scale language modeling for advancing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in various NLP tasks and extending these models to new applications like image inpainting. The authors also highlight their contributions, including the introduction of Switch Transformers for training trillion parameter models with simple and efficient sparsity and Megatron-LM for training multi-billion parameter language models using model parallelism.","{

1. Introduction
In recent years, large-scale language models have shown remarkable progress in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications.

2.2 Mixture of Experts (MoE)
Mixture of Experts (MoE) is a neural network architecture that can be trained efficiently with reduced communication costs and training instabilities. It was first introduced by Jordan et al. [4] in 1996 for speech recognition tasks. Since then, MoEs have been applied to various domains such as image classification [5], language modeling [6], and even music generation [7].

2.3 Model Parallelism
Model parallelism is a technique used to distribute the computational load of large-scale models across multiple GPUs or even multiple machines. It can be achieved through pipeline parallelism, data parallelism, or layer parallelism. Megatron-LM focuses on intra-layer model parallelism, which enables training transformer models with billions of parameters using 512 GPUs.

Abstract:
This paper presents several advances in large-scale language modeling, including the introduction of Switch Transformers for scaling to trillion parameter models with simple and efficient sparsity, Megatron-LM for training multi-billion parameter language models using model parallelism, and Glide-Text2Im for text-driven image editing.

1. Switch Transformers: We simplify the Mixture of Experts (MoE) routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques mitigate instabilities, enabling large sparse models to be trained for the first time with lower precision formats. We achieve up to 7x increases in pre-training speed using T5-Base and T5-Large models.

Megatron-LM: We present a simple, efficient intra-layer model parallel approach that enables training transformer models with billions of parameters without requiring new compiler or library changes. Our approach achieves 15.1 PetaFLOPs across the entire application with 76% scaling efficiency and sustains 30% of peak FLOPs compared to a strong single GPU baseline. We train an 8.3 billion parameter transformer language model, achieving SOTA results on WikiText103, LAMBADA, and RACE datasets.
3. Glide-Text2Im: We fine-tune our models to perform image inpainting, enabling powerful text-driven image editing. We train a smaller model on a filtered dataset and release the code and weights at https://github.com/openai/glide-text2im.

The paper includes several benchmarks for evaluating the performance of the language models, including sentiment analysis (SST-2), word sense disambiguation (WIC), sentence similarty (MRPC, STS-B, QQP), natural language inference (MNLI, QNLI, RTE, CB), question answering (MultiRC, RECORD, BoolQ), coreference resolution (WNLI, WSC), summarization (CNNDM, BBC XSum), and closed-book question answering (Natural Questions, Web Questions, Trivia QA). We also evaluate the models' common sense reasoning on the Winogrande Schema Challenge and their natural language inference capabilities on the Adversarial NLI Benchmark.","{

1295,Artificial Intelligence,Computer Sciences,transformer model,Deberta: Decoding-enhanced bert with disentangled attention,"Recent progress in pre-trained neural language models has significantly improved the performance of many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper we propose a new model architecture DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention) that improves the BERT and RoBERTa models using two novel techniques. The first is the disentangled attention mechanism, where each word is represented using two vectors that encode its content and position, respectively, and the attention weights among words are computed using disentangled matrices on their contents and relative positions. Second, an enhanced mask decoder is used to replace the output softmax layer to predict the masked tokens for model pretraining. We show that these two techniques significantly improve the efficiency of model pre-training and performance of downstream tasks. Compared to RoBERTa-Large, a DeBERTa model trained on half of the training data performs consistently better on a wide range of NLP tasks, achieving improvements on MNLI by +0.9% (90.2% vs. 91.1%), on SQuAD v2.0 by +2.3% (88.4% vs. 90.7%) and RACE by +3.6% (83.2% vs. 86.8%). The DeBERTa code and pre-trained models will be made publicly available at this https URL.",,OPT: Open Pre-trained Transformer Language Models,"Large language models, which are often trained for hundreds of thousands of compute days, have shown remarkable capabilities for zero- and few-shot learning. Given their computational cost, these models are difﬁcult to replicate without signiﬁcant capital. For the few that are available through APIs, no access is granted to the full model weights, making them difﬁcult to study. We present Open Pre-trained Transformers (OPT), a suite of decoder-only pre-trained transformers ranging from 125M to 175B parameters, which we aim to fully and responsibly share with interested researchers. We show that OPT-175B is comparable to GPT-3, 1 while requiring only 1/7th the carbon footprint to develop. We are also releasing our logbook detailing the infrastructure challenges we faced, along with code for experimenting with all of the released models.",10.48550/arXiv.2205.01068,Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training,"Natural language understanding comprises a wide range of diverse tasks such as textual entailment, question answering, semantic similarity assessment, and document classiﬁcation. Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant, labeled data for learning these speciﬁc tasks is scarce, making it challenging for discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative ﬁne-tuning on each speciﬁc task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-aware input transformations during ﬁne-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language understanding. Our general task-agnostic model outperforms discriminatively trained models that use architectures speciﬁcally crafted for each task, signiﬁcantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied. For instance, we achieve absolute improvements of 8.9% on commonsense reasoning (Stories Cloze Test), 5.7% on question answering (RACE), and 1.5% on textual entailment (MultiNLI).",,Decision Transformer: Reinforcement Learning via Sequence Modeling,"We introduce a framework that abstracts Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a sequence modeling problem. This allows us to draw upon the simplicity and scalability of the Transformer architecture, and associated advances in language modeling such as GPT-x and BERT. In particular, we present Decision Transformer, an architecture that casts the problem of RL as conditional sequence modeling. Unlike prior approaches to RL that fit value functions or compute policy gradients, Decision Transformer simply outputs the optimal actions by leveraging a causally masked Transformer. By conditioning an autoregressive model on the desired return (reward), past states, and actions, our Decision Transformer model can generate future actions that achieve the desired return. Despite its simplicity, Decision Transformer matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art model-free offline RL baselines on Atari, OpenAI Gym, and Key-to-Door tasks.",10.48550/arXiv.2106.01345,High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models,"By decomposing the image formation process into a sequential application of denoising autoencoders, diffusion models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art synthesis results on image data and beyond. Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve new state of the art scores for image inpainting and class-conditional image synthesis and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, text-to-image synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs.",10.48550/arXiv.2112.10752,"In addressing the research problem of transformer models, the methodologies across the five papers demonstrate innovative approaches to enhancing model performance and efficiency. DeBERTa (1) introduces a disentangled attention mechanism and an enhanced mask decoder, which together improve pre-training efficiency and downstream task performance by representing words with separate content and position vectors. Similarly, the Open Pre-trained Transformers (OPT) (2) offer a suite of decoder-only transformers that achieve comparable results to GPT-3 with a significantly reduced carbon footprint, emphasizing the importance of sustainable model development. The generative pre-training approach (3) leverages a large corpus of unlabeled text followed by discriminative fine-tuning, utilizing task-aware input transformations to achieve state-of-the-art results across various natural language understanding benchmarks. The Decision Transformer (4) abstracts reinforcement learning as a sequence modeling problem, using a causally masked Transformer to output optimal actions, thereby simplifying the RL process. Lastly, the High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models (5) applies diffusion models in the latent space of pre-trained autoencoders, introducing cross-attention layers to balance complexity reduction and detail preservation, which enables high-resolution synthesis with reduced computational demands. Collectively, these methodologies contribute to the advancement of transformer models by optimizing performance, efficiency, and applicability across different domains (1-5).","{

1302,Artificial Intelligence,Computer Sciences,transformer model,Finetuned language models are zero-shot learners,"A BSTRACT This paper explores a simple method for improving the zero-shot learning abilities of language models. We show that instruction tuning —ﬁnetuning language models on a collection of datasets described via instructions—substantially improves zero-shot performance on unseen tasks. We take a 137B parameter pretrained language model and instruction tune it on over 60 NLP datasets verbalized via natural language instruction templates. We evaluate this instruction-tuned model, which we call FLAN, on unseen task types. FLAN substantially improves the performance of its unmodiﬁed counterpart and surpasses zero-shot 175B GPT-3 on 20 of 25 datasets that we evaluate. FLAN even outperforms few-shot GPT-3 by a large margin on ANLI, RTE, BoolQ, AI2-ARC, OpenbookQA, and StoryCloze. Ablation studies reveal that number of ﬁnetuning datasets, model scale, and natural language instructions are key to the success of instruction tuning. many tasks",,XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding,"With the capability of modeling bidirectional contexts, denoising autoencoding based pretraining like BERT achieves better performance than pretraining approaches based on autoregressive language modeling. However, relying on corrupting the input with masks, BERT neglects dependency between the masked positions and suffers from a pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In light of these pros and cons, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining. Empirically, under comparable experiment settings, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large margin, including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking.",,Solving Quantitative Reasoning Problems with Language Models,"Language models have achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of tasks that require natural language understanding. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art models have generally struggled with tasks that require quantitative reasoning, such as solving mathematics, science, and engineering problems at the college level. To help close this gap, we introduce Minerva , a large language model pretrained on general natural language data and further trained on technical content. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on technical benchmarks without the use of external tools. We also evaluate our model on over two hundred undergraduate-level problems in physics, biology, chemistry, economics, and other sciences that require quantitative reasoning, and find that the model can correctly answer nearly a third of them.",10.48550/arXiv.2206.14858,Hierarchical Text-Conditional Image Generation with CLIP Latents,"Contrastive models like CLIP have been shown to learn robust representations of images that capture both semantics and style. To leverage these representations for image generation, we propose a two-stage model: a prior that generates a CLIP image embedding given a text caption, and a decoder that generates an image conditioned on the image embedding. We show that explicitly generating image representations improves image diversity with minimal loss in photorealism and caption similarity. Our decoders conditioned on image representations can also produce variations of an image that preserve both its semantics and style, while varying the non-essential details absent from the image representation. We use diffusion models for the decoder and experiment with both autoregressive and diffusion models for the prior, finding that the latter are computationally more efficient and produce higher-quality samples.",10.48550/arXiv.2204.06125,GPT-4 Technical Report,"We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4's performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4.",10.48550/arXiv.2303.08774,"In addressing the research problem of transformer models, the methodologies across the five papers demonstrate a progression in fine-tuning and pretraining techniques to enhance model performance on various tasks. Paper 1 introduces instruction tuning, where a language model is fine-tuned on a diverse set of NLP datasets described via natural language instructions, significantly improving zero-shot learning capabilities (1). Paper 2 proposes XLNet, which employs a generalized autoregressive pretraining method allowing for bidirectional context learning and overcoming BERT's limitations by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order (2).

Traditional models paired with vectorizers and data oversampling methods have been used to address imbalanced text data, with performance evaluated using F1 scores (4). Ensemble learning, combining features from multiple large language models with language-independent linguistic features, has achieved notable results, especially for languages less represented in training sets (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the importance of innovative techniques in sentiment analysis for African languages, highlighting the potential of multilingual models and ensemble learning to overcome data scarcity and improve generalization in low-resource settings.","{

1315,"Traffic and Transport Systems, Intelligent and Automated Traffic","Operations Research, Systems Engineering and Industrial Engineering",Data analysis task in cargo transportation,Analysis of the efficiency of land transport connectivity for international trade between Thailand and China,"Abstract This paper aims to analyze the efficiency of land transport connectivity for international trade between Thailand and China, focusing on the 4 main routes (R3A, R8, R9, and R12). The study commenced by taking the data of time, cost, and distance for transportation and border process of general cargo with 40 feet containers collected from field surveys and in-depth interviews of 126 key-informants from the 4 countries involved (Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and China). The data are analyzed, and created the relationship graphics by Time Cost Distance Analysis to evaluate the efficiency of the linkage land transport routes on trade between Thailand and China to identify the bottlenecks/obstacles along the 4 routes. This study will support government agencies in policy decision-making to improve the efficiency of each route. The result found that R9 is the most efficient route due to the low approximate transport cost (3.39 US dollars/km.) and the highest approximate speed (44.52 km./hr.). It is also found that the average Border Process Cost of routes R9, R8, and R12 is approximately 40% of the Total Cost, while the average Border Process Time of each route is approximately 16–25% of the Total Time, which shows that the border process cost and time of each route is quite high compared to operations along the route. Therefore, the government agencies of these 4 countries should jointly formulate policies related to the Border Process in order to develop more efficient land transport connectivity for Thailand and China’s international trade.",10.1080/23311886.2023.2196820,An Optimization Route Selection Method of Urban Oversize Cargo Transportation,"In order to select the optimal transportation route among alternative transportation routes more accurately and objectively, the choice of urban oversize cargo transportation routes was studied by taking the optimization weight–TOPSIS combination method for specific calculations. This model, based on an entropy weight method, cloud model, and TOPSIS method, combines the superiority of the cloud model for reflecting the randomness and discreteness of subjective evaluation with the advantages of the TOPSIS method in dealing with the problem of multi-objective programming. Through selecting and classifying several the main road influencing factors of urban oversize cargo transportation, based on the data of four urban roads, the entropy weight method is used to initially determine the weights of each influencing factor, the cloud model is used to optimize weights, the TOPSIS method is used to compare and evaluate the paths, and the optimal transportation route is selected on this basis. The results showed that the optimization weight–TOPSIS method is scientific and accurate for the multi-objective planning of oversize cargo transportation route selection, and solves the problem of the impact of subjective factors in existing methods and the difficulty of processing multiple influencing factors. The Pearson consistency test results show that the Pearson correlation coefficient between the proposed method and the actual oversize cargo transportation route selection is 0.995, which is higher than the calculation results without using the combination weight.",10.3390/app11052213,An AIMMS-based decision-making model for optimizing the intelligent stowage of export containers in a single bay,"Stowage operations in container terminals are an important part of a port's operational system, as the quality of stowage operations will directly affect the efficiency of port loading and discharge operations, and the scheduling of container shipping liners. The intelligent stowage of containers in container ships was studied in this work. A multi-objective integer programming model was constructed with the minimization of container rehandling, yard crane movements, and the sum of weight differences between stacked container pairs as its objective functions, to address the need for intelligent optimization of single bay export container stowage on a ship's deck. This model also satisfies the stability requirements of preliminary stowage plans drawn by shipping companies, and the operational requirements of container terminals. Linear computational methods were then constructed to transform non-linear constraints into linear ones for better AIMMS solution. Through numerous case analyses and systematic tests, it was shown that our system is able to rapidly solve for stowage planning optimization problems with complex preliminary stowage data, thus proving the applicability and effectiveness of this model. In particular, the application of this model will simultaneously address the safety of ship voyages, the transportation quality of shipping containers and other forms of cargo, and the cost efficiency of ship operations. In addition, this model will also contribute to the optimization of loading and discharge processes in container terminals. Therefore, our model has immense practical value for improving port productivity, as it will contribute to the organization of port operations in a rational, orderly and effective manner.",10.3934/dcdss.2019076,Localization of Relevant Urban Micro-Consolidation Centers for Last-Mile Cargo Bike Delivery Based on Real Demand Data and City Characteristics,"The use of cargo cycles for last-mile parcel distribution requires urban micro-consolidation centers (UMC). We develop an approach to localize suitable locations for UMCs with the consideration of three criteria: demand, land use, and type of road. The analysis considers metric levels (demand), linguistic levels (land use), and cardinal levels (type of road). The land-use category is divided into commercial, residential, mixed commercial and residential, and others. The type of road category is divided into bicycle road, pedestrian zone, oneway road, and traffic-calmed road. The approach is a hybrid multi-criteria analysis combining an Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and PROMETHEE methods. We apply the approach to the city center of Stuttgart in Germany, using real demand data provided by a large logistics service provider. We compared different scenarios weighting the criteria differently with DART software. The different weight allocation results in different numbers of required UMCs and slightly different locations. This research was able to develop, implement, and successfully apply the proposed approach. In subsequent steps, stakeholders such as logistics companies and cities should be involved at all levels of this approach to validate the selected criteria and depict the “weight” of each criterion.",10.1177/03611981211036351,Impacts of transport connections on port hinterlands,"ABSTRACT This paper examines the spatial distribution of freight flows between the French NUTS-3 regions and West European ports. It focuses on the impacts of the quality of inland and maritime connections on the scope of hinterlands. The results of a spatial interaction analysis reveal that the inland distance constraint is significantly lower when intermodal connections such as regular barge or rail services are available. A case study focused on East Asian trade confirmed that factors related to maritime connectivity, such as the frequency of services at ports and their ability to accommodate large vessels, also contribute to limit the distance impedance. However, these effects vary considerably depending on the value density of the cargo.",10.1080/00343404.2018.1474192,"The methodologies employed in the research on data analysis tasks in cargo transportation reveal a diverse set of approaches tailored to address specific aspects of the transportation process. The study on land transport connectivity between Thailand and China utilized Time Cost Distance Analysis, informed by field surveys and in-depth interviews, to evaluate the efficiency of trade routes and identify bottlenecks (1). In contrast, the urban oversize cargo transportation paper introduced an optimization weight–TOPSIS combination method, integrating the entropy weight method, cloud model, and TOPSIS method to objectively select optimal routes, validated by a Pearson consistency test (2). An AIMMS-based decision-making model was developed for optimizing container stowage, employing multi-objective integer programming and linear computational methods to transform non-linear constraints, thereby enhancing port productivity (3). A hybrid multi-criteria analysis combining AHP and PROMETHEE methods was used to localize urban micro-consolidation centers for cargo bike delivery, utilizing real demand data and city characteristics (4). Lastly, a spatial interaction analysis was conducted to understand the impact of transport connections on port hinterlands, with a focus on the role of intermodal connections and maritime connectivity in shaping freight flow distribution (5). Collectively, these methodologies contribute to a comprehensive understanding of cargo transportation efficiency, route optimization, and hinterland dynamics, each offering unique insights into improving the cargo transportation system.","{

}","The research problem of data analysis in cargo transportation is addressed through various methodological approaches and optimization models, aiming to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve decision-making in the sector. Studies have focused on evaluating the efficiency of land transport routes for international trade, as seen between Thailand and China, where factors such as transport cost, speed, and border processing times are critical for route selection (1). Urban oversize cargo transportation has been optimized using a weight–TOPSIS combination method, which integrates the randomness of subjective evaluations and multi-objective programming, thereby reducing the influence of subjective factors and handling multiple influencing factors effectively (2). The intelligent stowage of export containers has been modeled using AIMMS-based decision-making, which minimizes rehandling and ensures the safety and cost efficiency of ship operations, contributing to the optimization of port loading and discharge processes (3). The localization of Urban Micro-Consolidation Centers (UMCs) for last-mile cargo bike delivery has been approached through hybrid multi-criteria analysis, considering real demand data and city characteristics to facilitate efficient parcel distribution (4). Lastly, the spatial distribution of freight flows and the quality of inland and maritime connections have been shown to significantly impact the scope of port hinterlands, with intermodal connections and maritime connectivity factors such as service frequency and vessel accommodation capacity playing a crucial role (5).

1326,Artificial Intelligence,Computer Sciences,Recommender Systems,Semantic text mining with linked data,"Linked Data is an open data space that emerges from the publication and interlinking of structured data on the Web using the Semantic Web technologies. How to utilize this wealth of data is currently a focused research theme of the Semantic Web community. In this paper, we aim to utilize Linked Data to generate semantic annotations for frequent patterns extracted from textual documents. First, we extract semantic relations from textual documents and merge them into a set of semantic graphs. Then, we apply a frequent subgraph discovery algorithm on the set of graphs to generate frequent patterns. Finally, we annotate the discovered patterns using Linked Data. Our approach can be applied in such domains as terrorist network analysis and biological network analysis. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through an empirical experiment that discovers and validates relationships between political figures from large number of news on the Web.",10.1109/NCM.2009.131,Out of the box: Reasoning with graph convolution nets for factual visual question answering,"Accurately answering a question about a given image requires combining observations with general knowledge. While this is effortless for humans, reasoning with general knowledge remains an algorithmic challenge. To advance research in this direction a novel `fact-based' visual question answering (FVQA) task has been introduced recently along with a large set of curated facts which link two entities, i.e., two possible answers, via a relation. Given a question-image pair, deep network techniques have been employed to successively reduce the large set of facts until one of the two entities of the final remaining fact is predicted as the answer. We observe that a successive process which considers one fact at a time to form a local decision is sub-optimal. Instead, we develop an entity graph and use a graph convolutional network to `reason' about the correct answer by jointly considering all entities. We show on the challenging FVQA dataset that this leads to an improvement in accuracy of around 7% compared to the state of the art.",,Using linked data to interpret tables,"Vast amounts of information is available in structured forms like spreadsheets, database relations, and tables found in documents and on the Web. We describe an approach that uses linked data to interpret such tables and associate their components with nodes in a reference linked data collection. Our proposed framework assigns a class (i.e. type) to table columns, links table cells to entities, and inferred relations between columns to properties. The resulting interpretation can be used to annotate tables, confirm existing facts in the linked data collection, and propose new facts to be added. Our implemented prototype uses DBpedia as the linked data collection and Wikitology for background knowledge. We evaluated its performance using a collection of tables from Google Squared, Wikipedia and the Web.",,Knowledge-based interactive postmining of association rules using ontologies,"In Data Mining, the usefulness of association rules is strongly limited by the huge amount of delivered rules. To overcome this drawback, several methods were proposed in the literature such as itemset concise representations, redundancy reduction, and postprocessing. However, being generally based on statistical information, most of these methods do not guarantee that the extracted rules are interesting for the user. Thus, it is crucial to help the decision-maker with an efficient postprocessing step in order to reduce the number of rules. This paper proposes a new interactive approach to prune and filter discovered rules. First, we propose to use ontologies in order to improve the integration of user knowledge in the postprocessing task. Second, we propose the Rule Schema formalism extending the specification language proposed by Liu et al. for user expectations. Furthermore, an interactive framework is designed to assist the user throughout the analyzing task. Applying our new approach over voluminous sets of rules, we were able, by integrating domain expert knowledge in the postprocessing step, to reduce the number of rules to several dozens or less. Moreover, the quality of the filtered rules was validated by the domain expert at various points in the interactive process.",10.1109/tkde.2010.29,Explod: a framework for explaining recommendations based on the linked open data cloud,"In this paper we present ExpLOD, a framework which exploits the information available in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud to generate a natural language explanation of the suggestions produced by a recommendation algorithm. The methodology is based on building a graph in which the items liked by a user are connected to the items recommended through the properties available in the LOD cloud. Next, given this graph, we implemented some techniques to rank those properties and we used the most relevant ones to feed a module for generating explanations in natural language. In the experimental evaluation we performed a user study with 308 subjects aiming to investigate to what extent our explanation framework can lead to more transparent, trustful and engaging recommendations. The preliminary results provided us with encouraging findings, since our algorithm performed better than both a non-personalized explanation baseline and a popularity-based one.",10.1145/2959100.2959173,"In the realm of recommender systems, recent methodologies have leveraged the richness of Linked Data and Semantic Web technologies to enhance the relevance and interpretability of recommendations. The approach in (1) involves extracting semantic relations from text and merging them into semantic graphs, followed by the application of a frequent subgraph discovery algorithm to generate annotated patterns, demonstrating its utility in domains like political analysis. Similarly, (2) advances the use of graph convolutional networks to reason about visual question answering by considering all entities jointly, rather than sequentially, to improve accuracy. In the context of structured data, (3) describes a framework that uses Linked Data to interpret tables, linking table components to a reference linked data collection, thereby enriching table annotations and proposing new facts. The interactive postmining of association rules in (4) incorporates ontologies to integrate user knowledge, employing a Rule Schema formalism to prune and filter rules interactively, significantly reducing the number of rules while maintaining their quality. Lastly, (5) presents ExpLOD, a framework that utilizes the Linked Open Data cloud to generate natural language explanations for recommendations, creating a graph that connects user preferences to recommended items, and ranking properties to produce transparent and engaging explanations. Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of integrating semantic knowledge, graph-based reasoning, and user interaction to refine and elucidate the outputs of recommender systems (1-5).","{

}","Recent advancements in recommender systems have leveraged the wealth of structured data available on the web, particularly through the use of Linked Data and Semantic Web technologies. A common theme across these studies is the enhancement of recommendation algorithms by incorporating semantic annotations and linked data to provide more accurate, interpretable, and user-relevant suggestions (1, 3, 5). For instance, semantic text mining techniques have been applied to extract and validate relationships from large datasets, demonstrating the potential for more nuanced analysis in domains such as political news (1). Similarly, the integration of linked data has been shown to improve the interpretation of structured information like tables, enabling the enrichment of recommender systems with additional context and the proposal of new facts (3). Graph-based approaches, such as those using graph convolutional networks, have also been employed to reason about entities and their relationships, leading to significant improvements in tasks like factual visual question answering (2). Moreover, knowledge-based interactive postmining and the use of ontologies have been proposed to refine the output of association rule mining, ensuring that the recommendations align with user expectations and domain-specific knowledge (4). Finally, the ExpLOD framework illustrates how explanations generated from the Linked Open Data cloud can enhance user trust and engagement with recommender systems, highlighting the importance of transparency and personalization in recommendations (5).

1327,Artificial Intelligence,Computer Sciences,Recommender Systems,Improving sequential recommendation with knowledge-enhanced memory networks,"With the revival of neural networks, many studies try to adapt powerful sequential neural models, ıe Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), to sequential recommendation. RNN-based networks encode historical interaction records into a hidden state vector. Although the state vector is able to encode sequential dependency, it still has limited representation power in capturing complicated user preference. It is difficult to capture fine-grained user preference from the interaction sequence. Furthermore, the latent vector representation is usually hard to understand and explain. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel knowledge enhanced sequential recommender. Our model integrates the RNN-based networks with Key-Value Memory Network (KV-MN). We further incorporate knowledge base (KB) information to enhance the semantic representation of KV-MN. RNN-based models are good at capturing sequential user preference, while knowledge-enhanced KV-MNs are good at capturing attribute-level user preference. By using a hybrid of RNNs and KV-MNs, it is expected to be endowed with both benefits from these two components. The sequential preference representation together with the attribute-level preference representation are combined as the final representation of user preference. With the incorporation of KB information, our model is also highly interpretable. To our knowledge, it is the first time that sequential recommender is integrated with external memories by leveraging large-scale KB information.",10.1145/3209978.3210017,Semantic explanations of predictions,"The main objective of explanations is to transmit knowledge to humans. This work proposes to construct informative explanations for predictions made from machine learning models. Motivated by the observations from social sciences, our approach selects data points from the training sample that exhibit special characteristics crucial for explanation, for instance, ones contrastive to the classification prediction and ones representative of the models. Subsequently, semantic concepts are derived from the selected data points through the use of domain ontologies. These concepts are filtered and ranked to produce informative explanations that improves human understanding. The main features of our approach are that (1) knowledge about explanations is captured in the form of ontological concepts, (2) explanations include contrastive evidences in addition to normal evidences, and (3) explanations are user relevant.",,Interaction Embeddings for Prediction and Explanation in Knowledge Graphs,"Knowledge graph embedding aims to learn distributed representations for entities and relations, and is proven to be effective in many applications. Crossover interactions -- bi-directional effects between entities and relations --- help select related information when predicting a new triple, but haven't been formally discussed before. In this paper, we propose CrossE, a novel knowledge graph embedding which explicitly simulates crossover interactions. It not only learns one general embedding for each entity and relation as most previous methods do, but also generates multiple triple specific embeddings for both of them, named interaction embeddings. We evaluate embeddings on typical link prediction tasks and find that CrossE achieves state-of-the-art results on complex and more challenging datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate embeddings from a new perspective -- giving explanations for predicted triples, which is important for real applications. In this work, an explanation for a triple is regarded as a reliable closed-path between the head and the tail entity. Compared to other baselines, we show experimentally that CrossE, benefiting from interaction embeddings, is more capable of generating reliable explanations to support its predictions.",10.1145/3289600.3291014,Knowledge-aware autoencoders for explainable recommender systems,"Recommender Systems have been widely used to help users in finding what they are looking for thus tackling the information overload problem. After several years of research and industrial findings looking after better algorithms to improve accuracy and diversity metrics, explanation services for recommendation are gaining momentum as a tool to provide a human-understandable feedback to results computed, in most of the cases, by black-box machine learning techniques. As a matter of fact, explanations may guarantee users satisfaction, trust, and loyalty in a system. In this paper, we evaluate how different information encoded in a Knowledge Graph are perceived by users when they are adopted to show them an explanation. More precisely, we compare how the use of categorical information, factual one or a mixture of them both in building explanations, affect explanatory criteria for a recommender system. Experimental results are validated through an A/B testing platform which uses a recommendation engine based on a Semantics-Aware Autoencoder to build users profiles which are in turn exploited to compute recommendation lists and to provide an explanation.",10.1145/3270323.3270327,Linked data and online classifications to organise mined patterns in patient data,"In this paper, we investigate the use of web data resources in medicine, especially through medical classifications made available using the principles of Linked Data, to support the interpretation of patterns mined from patient care trajectories. Interpreting such patterns is naturally a challenge for an analyst, as it requires going through large amounts of results and access to sufficient background knowledge. We employ linked data, especially as exposed through the BioPortal system, to create a navigation structure within the patterns obtained form sequential pattern mining. We show how this approach provides a flexible way to explore data about trajectories of diagnoses and treatments according to different medical classifications.",,"In the realm of recommender systems, recent methodologies have leveraged the power of neural networks and knowledge graphs to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of recommendations. The integration of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Key-Value Memory Networks (KV-MNs), augmented by knowledge base information, has been proposed to capture both sequential and attribute-level user preferences, offering a more nuanced user preference representation and interpretability (1). Similarly, the use of domain ontologies to derive semantic concepts from training data points provides contrastive and representative explanations, improving user understanding of machine-generated recommendations (2). The CrossE model introduces interaction embeddings within knowledge graphs, which generate multiple triple-specific embeddings to facilitate prediction and explanation, outperforming state-of-the-art results in link prediction tasks (3). Knowledge-aware autoencoders have been evaluated for their ability to use different types of information from Knowledge Graphs to provide explanations that enhance user satisfaction and trust in recommender systems (4). Lastly, the use of linked data and online classifications has been explored to organize patterns mined from patient data, employing medical classifications to support the interpretation of patterns and provide a flexible exploration of patient care trajectories (5). These methodologies collectively contribute to the advancement of recommender systems by emphasizing the importance of interpretability, user relevance, and the integration of structured knowledge for enhanced recommendation quality.","{

}","Recent advancements in recommender systems have emphasized the integration of knowledge-based techniques to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of recommendations. The incorporation of external knowledge bases and ontologies has been pivotal in capturing fine-grained user preferences and providing semantic explanations for recommendations (1, 2). For instance, knowledge-enhanced memory networks have been utilized to improve sequential recommendation by combining the strengths of RNN-based models and Key-Value Memory Networks, thereby capturing both sequential and attribute-level user preferences while also ensuring high interpretability through the use of large-scale knowledge bases (1). Similarly, the construction of informative explanations using domain ontologies and contrastive evidence has been proposed to improve human understanding of machine learning predictions, highlighting the importance of user-relevant explanations (2). The concept of interaction embeddings in knowledge graphs further supports this trend, where the generation of multiple triple-specific embeddings enables more reliable explanations for predictions (3). Knowledge-aware autoencoders have also been explored, demonstrating how different types of information from Knowledge Graphs can affect the explanatory criteria of recommender systems and influence user satisfaction (4). Additionally, the use of linked data and online classifications has been investigated to organize patterns mined from patient data, showcasing the potential of linked data to support the interpretation of complex information and enhance the navigation of medical classifications (5).

Instead of relying only on document-to-question interaction or discrete features as in prior work, our model attends to relevant external knowledge and combines this knowledge with the context representation before inferring the answer. This allows the model to attract and imply knowledge from an external knowledge source that is not explicitly stated in the text, but that is relevant for inferring the answer. Our model improves results over a very strong baseline on a hard Common Nouns dataset, making it a strong competitor of much more complex models. By including knowledge explicitly, our model can also provide evidence about the background knowledge used in the RC process.",10.18653/v1/p18-1076,Learning heterogeneous knowledge base embeddings for explainable recommendation,"Providing model-generated explanations in recommender systems is important to user experience. State-of-the-art recommendation algorithms—especially the collaborative filtering (CF)- based approaches with shallow or deep models—usually work with various unstructured information sources for recommendation, such as textual reviews, visual images, and various implicit or explicit feedbacks. Though structured knowledge bases were considered in content-based approaches, they have been largely ignored recently due to the availability of vast amounts of data and the learning power of many complex models. However, structured knowledge bases exhibit unique advantages in personalized recommendation systems. When the explicit knowledge about users and items is considered for recommendation, the system could provide highly customized recommendations based on users’ historical behaviors and the knowledge is helpful for providing informed explanations regarding the recommended items. A great challenge for using knowledge bases for recommendation is how to integrate large-scale structured and unstructured data, while taking advantage of collaborative filtering for highly accurate performance. Recent achievements in knowledge-base embedding (KBE) sheds light on this problem, which makes it possible to learn user and item representations while preserving the structure of their relationship with external knowledge for explanation. In this work, we propose to explain knowledge-base embeddings for explainable recommendation. Specifically, we propose a knowledge-base representation learning framework to embed heterogeneous entities for recommendation, and based on the embedded knowledge base, a soft matching algorithm is proposed to generate personalized explanations for the recommended items. Experimental results on real-world e-commerce datasets verified the superior recommendation performance and the explainability power of our approach compared with state-of-the-art baselines.",10.3390/a11090137,Knowledge engineering tools for reasoning with scientific observations and interpretations: a neural connectivity use case,"Abstract

Background
We address the goal of curating observations from published experiments in a generalizable form; reasoning over these observations to generate interpretations and then querying this interpreted knowledge to supply the supporting evidence. We present web-application software as part of the 'BioScholar' project (R01-GM083871) that fully instantiates this process for a well-defined domain: using tract-tracing experiments to study the neural connectivity of the rat brain.


Results
The main contribution of this work is to provide the first instantiation of a knowledge representation for experimental observations called 'Knowledge Engineering from Experimental Design' (KEfED) based on experimental variables and their interdependencies. The software has three parts: (a) the KEfED model editor - a design editor for creating KEfED models by drawing a flow diagram of an experimental protocol; (b) the KEfED data interface - a spreadsheet-like tool that permits users to enter experimental data pertaining to a specific model; (c) a 'neural connection matrix' interface that presents neural connectivity as a table of ordinal connection strengths representing the interpretations of tract-tracing data. This tool also allows the user to view experimental evidence pertaining to a specific connection. BioScholar is built in Flex 3.5. It uses Persevere (a noSQL database) as a flexible data store and PowerLoom® (a mature First Order Logic reasoning system) to execute queries using spatial reasoning over the BAMS neuroanatomical ontology.


Conclusions
We first introduce the KEfED approach as a general approach and describe its possible role as a way of introducing structured reasoning into models of argumentation within new models of scientific publication. We then describe the design and implementation of our example application: the BioScholar software. This is presented as a possible biocuration interface and supplementary reasoning toolkit for a larger, more specialized bioinformatics system: the Brain Architecture Management System (BAMS).",10.1186/1471-2105-12-351,Answering science exam questions using query reformulation with background knowledge,"Open-domain question answering (QA) is an important problem in AI and NLP that is emerging as a bellwether for progress on the generalizability of AI methods and techniques. Much of the progress in open-domain QA systems has been realized through advances in information retrieval methods and corpus construction. In this paper, we focus on the recently introduced ARC Challenge dataset, which contains 2,590 multiple choice questions authored for grade-school science exams. These questions are selected to be the most challenging for current QA systems, and current state of the art performance is only slightly better than random chance. We present a system that reformulates a given question into queries that are used to retrieve supporting text from a large corpus of science-related text. Our rewriter is able to incorporate background knowledge from ConceptNet and -- in tandem with a generic textual entailment system trained on SciTail that identifies support in the retrieved results -- outperforms several strong baselines on the end-to-end QA task despite only being trained to identify essential terms in the original source question. We use a generalizable decision methodology over the retrieved evidence and answer candidates to select the best answer. By combining query reformulation, background knowledge, and textual entailment our system is able to outperform several strong baselines on the ARC dataset.",,"In addressing the challenge of enhancing recommender systems, recent methodologies have leveraged diverse forms of knowledge integration and reasoning. A symbolic approach has been utilized to explain errors in image classification by understanding algorithmic failures, which can be adapted to improve recommendation accuracy (1). Similarly, the integration of external commonsense knowledge into a neural reading comprehension model has shown that incorporating structured external knowledge can significantly enhance performance, a technique that could be applied to recommender systems to provide contextually relevant suggestions (2). The use of structured knowledge bases in conjunction with collaborative filtering has been proposed to create personalized recommendations, where knowledge-base embeddings (KBE) are employed to preserve the structure of user-item relationships, providing a foundation for explainable recommendations (3). In the realm of scientific observations, the Knowledge Engineering from Experimental Design (KEfED) model has been developed to curate and reason over experimental data, offering a methodology that could be adapted for reasoning over user preferences and behaviors in recommender systems (4). Lastly, the approach of query reformulation with background knowledge in open-domain question answering demonstrates the potential of using external knowledge sources and textual entailment to refine recommendations and improve system performance (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of integrating structured knowledge and reasoning capabilities to enhance the accuracy and explainability of recommender systems.","{

The integration of structured knowledge bases has been identified as a key factor in providing personalized and explainable recommendations, as it allows systems to leverage user and item relationships with external knowledge to generate informed explanations (3). Similarly, in reading comprehension and question answering, the inclusion of commonsense knowledge and background information has been shown to significantly improve model performance by enabling the inference of answers from knowledge not explicitly stated in the text (2, 5). Moreover, the use of knowledge engineering tools in scientific domains, such as neural connectivity studies, demonstrates the utility of curating and reasoning over experimental observations to generate interpretable knowledge, which can be queried to support evidence-based conclusions (4). These themes underscore the growing consensus that the incorporation of external, structured knowledge sources into AI systems not only enhances their cognitive capabilities but also provides a pathway towards more transparent and interpretable machine learning solutions.","{

}","In the realm of machine learning and artificial intelligence, recommender systems aim to deliver personalized recommendations based on users' historical behaviors and preferences. Three recent studies offer unique methodological approaches to enhance these systems.

Firstly, paper (3) proposes a knowledge-base representation learning framework for embedding heterogeneous entities in recommendation systems, enabling the generation of personalized explanations for recommended items (3). This approach takes advantage of collaborative filtering and large-scale structured data integration for improved performance and explainability.

Secondly, paper (2) introduces a neural reading comprehension model that integrates external commonsense knowledge to enhance cloze-style reading comprehension (2). By attending to relevant external knowledge and combining it with context representations, the model can attract and imply knowledge from an external source, leading to better performance on hard Common Nouns datasets.

Lastly, paper (5) focuses on answering science exam questions using query reformulation and background knowledge (5). The system reformulates a given question into queries that retrieve supporting text from a large corpus of science-related text, incorporating background knowledge from ConceptNet to improve performance on the ARC Challenge dataset.

These studies demonstrate the importance of integrating external knowledge sources and advanced learning techniques to enhance recommender systems' capabilities and provide more accurate and personalized recommendations (2, 3).

Here I will describe our on-going efforts in linking the two resources and issues faced in matching the Wikidata and WordNet knowledge graphs.

While this is effortless for humans, reasoning with general knowledge remains an algorithmic challenge. To advance research in this direction a novel `fact-based' visual question answering (FVQA) task has been introduced recently along with a large set of curated facts which link two entities, i.e., two possible answers, via a relation. Given a question-image pair, deep network techniques have been employed to successively reduce the large set of facts until one of the two entities of the final remaining fact is predicted as the answer. We observe that a successive process which considers one fact at a time to form a local decision is sub-optimal. Instead, we develop an entity graph and use a graph convolutional network to `reason' about the correct answer by jointly considering all entities. We show on the challenging FVQA dataset that this leads to an improvement in accuracy of around 7% compared to the state of the art.",,Using taxonomies to facilitate the analysis of the association rules,"The Data Mining process enables the end users to analyze, understand and use the extracted knowledge in an intelligent system or to support in the decision-making processes. However, many algorithms used in the process encounter large quantities of patterns, complicating the analysis of the patterns. This fact occurs with association rules, a Data Mining technique that tries to identify intrinsic patterns in large data sets. A method that can help the analysis of the association rules is the use of taxonomies in the step of post-processing knowledge. In this paper, the GART algorithm is proposed, which uses taxonomies to generalize association rules, and the RulEE-GAR computational module, that enables the analysis of the generalized rules.",,How a general-purpose common- sense ontology can improve performance of learning-based image retrieval,"The knowledge representation community has built general-purpose ontologies which contain large amounts of commonsense knowledge over relevant aspects of the world, including useful visual information, e.g.: ""a ball is used by a football player"", ""a tennis player is located at a tennis court"". Current state-of-the-art approaches for visual recognition do not exploit these rule-based knowledge sources. Instead, they learn recognition models directly from training examples. In this paper, we study how general-purpose ontologies—specifically, MIT's ConceptNet ontology—can improve the performance of state-of-the-art vision systems. As a testbed, we tackle the problem of sentence-based image retrieval. Our retrieval approach incorporates knowledge from ConceptNet on top of a large pool of object detectors derived from a deep learning technique. In our experiments, we show that ConceptNet can improve performance on a common benchmark dataset. Key to our performance is the use of the ESPGAME dataset to select visually relevant relations from ConceptNet. Consequently, a main conclusion of this work is that general-purpose commonsense ontologies improve performance on visual reasoning tasks when properly filtered to select meaningful visual relations.",10.24963/ijcai.2017/178,"In the realm of rule-based machine learning, methodologies are being developed to enhance the interpretability and performance of algorithms in tasks such as image classification and visual question answering.

Another study integrates ImageNet WordNet synsets with Wikidata, providing deep learning algorithms with a rich, multilingual knowledge graph to improve real-time image classification and labeling in various languages (2). In the context of factual visual question answering, researchers have shifted from processing individual facts to employing graph convolutional networks that reason with an entity graph, considering all entities simultaneously, which has led to significant improvements in accuracy (3).

For a city the production of Dashboards is not something that is performed once forever, and it is a continuous working task for improving city monitoring, to follow extraordinary events and/or activities, to monitor critical conditions and cases. Thus, relevant complexities are due to the data aggregation architecture and to the identification of modalities to present data and their identification, prediction, etc., to arrive at producing high level representations that can be used by decision makers. In this paper, the architecture of a Dashboard Builder for creating Smart City Control Rooms is presented. As a validation and test, it has been adopted for generating the dashboards in Florence city and other cities in Tuscany area. The solution proposed has been developed in the context of REPLICATE H2020 European Commission Flagship project on Smart City and Communities.",10.18293/vlss2018-030,ISO-Standardized Smart City Platform Architecture and Dashboard,"A concept guided by the ISO 37120 standard for city services and quality of life is suggested as unified framework for smart city dashboards. The slow (annual, quarterly, or monthly) ISO 37120 indicators are enhanced and complemented with more detailed and person-centric indicators that can further accelerate the transition toward smart cities. The architecture supports three tasks: acquire and manage data from heterogeneous sensors; process data originated from heterogeneous sources (sensors, OpenData, social data, blogs, news, and so on); and implement such collection and processing on the cloud. A prototype application based on the proposed architecture concept is developed for the city of Skopje, Macedonia.

This information supports various decision-making processes that affect citizens’ quality of life. Cities across the world have similar, if not the same, functional and nonfunctional requirements to develop their dashboards. Software developers will face the same challenges and they are likely to provide similar solutions for each developed city dashboard. Moreover, the development of these dashboards implies a significant investment in terms of human and financial resources from cities. The automation of the development of smart cities dashboards is feasible as these visualization systems will have common requirements between cities. This article introduces cities-board, a framework to automate the development of smart cities dashboards based on model-driven engineering. Cities-board proposes a graphic domain-specific language (DSL) that allows the creation of dashboard models with concepts that are closer to city authorities. Cities-board transforms these dashboards models to functional code artifacts by using model-to-model (M2M) and model-to-text (M2T) transformations. We evaluate cities-board by measuring the generation time, and the quality of the generated code under different models configurations.

ANALYTICAL URBAN DASHBOARD","Abstract. As many cities increase in size across multiple dimensions such as population, economic output and physical size, new methods for understanding and managing cities are required. Data produced by and about urban environments offer insight into what is happening in cities. Real-time data from sensors within the city record current transport and environmental conditions such as noise levels, water levels, journey times and public transport delays. Similarly administrative data such as demographics, employment statistics, property prices and crime rates all provide insight into how a city is evolving. Traditionally, these data were maintained separately and managed by individual city departments. Advances in technology and a move to open-government have placed many of these data in the public domain. Urban dashboards have emerged as a technique to visualise these data in an accessible way. This paper describes the implementation of one such dashboard, the Dublin Dashboard, an interactive website which collects, analyses and visualises data from a variety of sources about Dublin in Ireland through a series of interactive maps, graphs and applications. This paper describes the approach, the data and the technology used to develop the Dublin Dashboard and acts as a guideline for developing urban dashboards in other cities.",10.5194/isprs-annals-iv-4-w1-19-2016,A Smart City Dashboard for Combining and Analysing Multi-source Data Streams,"Smart city projects are making available numerous, diverse, potentially valuable data streams. However, it is cumbersome and laborious for domain experts to identify, analyse and inter-relate such streams. In this paper we describe a system that is designed to support these users to obtain an understanding of key features of individual streams, and to undertake a variety of analyses that inter-relate multiple streams. Three case studies are presented, showing the use of the system to process live car-park, weather, building energy consumption and bicycle journey data from the CityVerve Smart City project in Manchester.",10.1109/hpcc/smartcity/dss.2018.00226,"In addressing the research problem of data analysis within smart city contexts, the methodologies employed across the five papers reveal a convergence on the development and utilization of dashboards for real-time data visualization and decision support. The Smart City Control Room Dashboards leverage a Dashboard Builder architecture to continuously improve city monitoring and decision-making, validated through implementation in Florence and other Tuscan cities (1). This approach is complemented by the ISO-standardized framework proposed for smart city dashboards, which integrates slow and fast indicators to enhance city services and quality of life, with a prototype applied in Skopje (2). Similarly, the Cities-Board framework automates smart city dashboard development using a graphic domain-specific language and model-driven engineering, offering a more efficient generation of functional code artifacts for city authorities (3). The Dublin Dashboard exemplifies the practical application of these methodologies, collecting and visualizing real-time and administrative data through interactive maps and graphs, serving as a model for other urban dashboards (4). Lastly, a system designed to support domain experts in combining and analyzing multi-source data streams is presented, with case studies demonstrating its effectiveness in processing diverse data from Manchester's CityVerve Smart City project (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of adaptable, automated, and standardized tools in synthesizing complex urban data for actionable insights.","{

ANALYTICAL URBAN DASHBOARD","Abstract. As many cities increase in size across multiple dimensions such as population, economic output and physical size, new methods for understanding and managing cities are required. Data produced by and about urban environments offer insight into what is happening in cities. Real-time data from sensors within the city record current transport and environmental conditions such as noise levels, water levels, journey times and public transport delays. Similarly administrative data such as demographics, employment statistics, property prices and crime rates all provide insight into how a city is evolving. Traditionally, these data were maintained separately and managed by individual city departments. Advances in technology and a move to open-government have placed many of these data in the public domain. Urban dashboards have emerged as a technique to visualise these data in an accessible way. This paper describes the implementation of one such dashboard, the Dublin Dashboard, an interactive website which collects, analyses and visualises data from a variety of sources about Dublin in Ireland through a series of interactive maps, graphs and applications. This paper describes the approach, the data and the technology used to develop the Dublin Dashboard and acts as a guideline for developing urban dashboards in other cities.",10.5194/isprs-annals-iv-4-w1-19-2016,"Research Notes: Smart City Control Room Dashboards: Big Data Infrastructure, from data to decision support","Smart City Control Rooms are mainly focused on Dashboards which are in turn created by using the socalled Dashboard Builders tools or generated custom. For a city the production of Dashboards is not something that is performed once forever, and it is a continuous working task for improving city monitoring, to follow extraordinary events and/or activities, to monitor critical conditions and cases. Thus, relevant complexities are due to the data aggregation architecture and to the identification of modalities to present data and their identification, prediction, etc., to arrive at producing high level representations that can be used by decision makers. In this paper, the architecture of a Dashboard Builder for creating Smart City Control Rooms is presented. As a validation and test, it has been adopted for generating the dashboards in Florence city and other cities in Tuscany area. The solution proposed has been developed in the context of REPLICATE H2020 European Commission Flagship project on Smart City and Communities.",10.18293/vlss2018-030,Cities-Board: A Framework to Automate the Development of Smart Cities Dashboards,"Smart cities’ authorities use graphic dashboards to visualize and analyze important information on cities, citizens, institutions, and their interactions. This information supports various decision-making processes that affect citizens’ quality of life. Cities across the world have similar, if not the same, functional and nonfunctional requirements to develop their dashboards. Software developers will face the same challenges and they are likely to provide similar solutions for each developed city dashboard. Moreover, the development of these dashboards implies a significant investment in terms of human and financial resources from cities. The automation of the development of smart cities dashboards is feasible as these visualization systems will have common requirements between cities. This article introduces cities-board, a framework to automate the development of smart cities dashboards based on model-driven engineering. Cities-board proposes a graphic domain-specific language (DSL) that allows the creation of dashboard models with concepts that are closer to city authorities. Cities-board transforms these dashboards models to functional code artifacts by using model-to-model (M2M) and model-to-text (M2T) transformations. We evaluate cities-board by measuring the generation time, and the quality of the generated code under different models configurations. Results show the strengths and weaknesses of cities-board compared against a generic code generation tool.",10.1109/jiot.2020.3002581,ISO-Standardized Smart City Platform Architecture and Dashboard,"A concept guided by the ISO 37120 standard for city services and quality of life is suggested as unified framework for smart city dashboards. The slow (annual, quarterly, or monthly) ISO 37120 indicators are enhanced and complemented with more detailed and person-centric indicators that can further accelerate the transition toward smart cities. The architecture supports three tasks: acquire and manage data from heterogeneous sensors; process data originated from heterogeneous sources (sensors, OpenData, social data, blogs, news, and so on); and implement such collection and processing on the cloud. A prototype application based on the proposed architecture concept is developed for the city of Skopje, Macedonia. This article is part of a special issue on smart cities.",10.1109/mprv.2017.31,CityDash: Visualising a Changing City Using Open Data,"In an increasingly urbanised world, there are pressures being placed on our cities, which planners, decision-makers, and communities need to be able to respond to. Data driven responses and tools that can support the communication of information, and indicators on a city’s performance are becoming increasingly available and have the potential to play a critical role in understanding and managing complex urban systems. In this research, we will review international efforts in the creation of city dashboards and introduce the City of Sydney Dashboard, known as CityDash. This chapter culminates in a number of recommendations for city dashboards’ implementation. The recommendations for city dashboards include: consolidated information on a single web page, live data feeds relevant to planners and decision-makers as well as citizens’ daily lives, and site analytics as a way of evaluating user interactions and preferences",10.1007/978-3-319-57819-4_19,"In the realm of smart city management, the methodologies for data analysis are converging towards the development and utilization of urban dashboards, which integrate real-time and administrative data to aid in decision-making processes. The Dublin Dashboard leverages interactive maps, graphs, and applications to visualize a variety of data sources, serving as a model for other cities (1). Similarly, the Smart City Control Room Dashboards focus on continuous improvement and employ a Dashboard Builder architecture to facilitate city monitoring and support decision-makers, as demonstrated in Florence and other Tuscan cities (2). The Cities-Board framework automates the development of these dashboards through a graphic domain-specific language and model-driven engineering, streamlining the creation process and generating functional code artifacts, thereby reducing human and financial resource investments (3). An ISO-standardized approach, as applied in Skopje, Macedonia, aligns with the ISO 37120 standard to enhance slow indicators with more detailed, person-centric data, integrating heterogeneous sensor data and cloud processing (4). Lastly, CityDash emphasizes the importance of live data feeds and site analytics to inform planners, decision-makers, and citizens, recommending a consolidated web page for effective communication and performance evaluation (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the trend towards automated, standardized, and user-friendly platforms for urban data analysis and visualization.","{

}","The burgeoning complexity of urban environments necessitates innovative approaches to data analysis, where real-time and administrative data are synthesized to inform city management and evolution (1). Urban dashboards have become pivotal in visualizing such data, aiding decision-makers by providing accessible, interactive maps, graphs, and applications that encapsulate various city dimensions (1, 5). The continuous development of these dashboards is critical for monitoring dynamic urban activities and conditions, necessitating robust data aggregation architectures and high-level representations for effective decision support (2). To streamline the creation of these complex systems, frameworks like Cities-Board have been introduced, automating the development of smart city dashboards through model-driven engineering, thereby reducing the human and financial resources required (3). Aligning with international standards, such as ISO 37120, enhances the utility of dashboards by integrating slow and fast indicators, offering a comprehensive view of city services and quality of life, while leveraging cloud-based architectures for data management and processing (4). Recommendations for effective dashboard implementation emphasize the importance of consolidated, live data feeds and site analytics to cater to the needs of planners, decision-makers, and the general populace, ensuring that urban systems are understood and managed with precision and agility (5).","{

}","In the realm of urban management, real-time data analysis plays a pivotal role in understanding and optimizing city operations. Four papers propose various approaches to creating smart city dashboards for effective data visualization and decision support (1, 2, 3, 5). The Dublin Dashboard project describes an interactive website that collects, analyzes, and visualizes real-time urban data from multiple sources using maps, graphs, and applications (1). Another paper introduces a Dashboard Builder for creating Smart City Control Rooms, focusing on the complexities of data aggregation and presentation for decision makers (2).

Cities-Board, a framework, automates the development of smart city dashboards based on model-driven engineering, addressing common requirements between cities and reducing development costs (3). The fourth paper suggests an ISO-standardized architecture for smart city platforms and dashboards, enhancing annual indicators with more detailed and person-centric data (4). All these methodologies emphasize the importance of real-time data analysis and effective visualization in creating actionable insights for urban planning and management.

These interactive platforms collect, process, and present data from multiple sources in an accessible manner, enabling decision-makers to monitor city performance and respond to emerging issues in real-time (1, 5).

The development of urban dashboards involves complexities related to data aggregation and presentation modalities for high-level representations (2).

We used a microcalorimeter for such laboratory astrophysics studies because it has a resolving power ≈1000, quantum efficiency approaching 100%, and a bandwidth that spans the X-ray energies from 0.2 keV to 10 keV. Our microcalorimeter, coupled with an X-ray optic to increase the effective solid angle, provides a significant new capability for laboratory astrophysics measurements. Broadband spectra obtained from the National Institute of Standards and Technology EBIT with an energy resolution approaching that of a Bragg crystal spectrometer are presented for nitrogen, oxygen, neon, argon, and krypton in various stages of ionization. We have compared the measured line intensities to theoretical predictions for an EBIT plasma.",10.1086/309420,Laboratory Data on the EUV/Soft-X-Ray Flux Problem of Fe xviii and Fe xix,"Abstract
Observations by the spacecraft Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE), Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE), Chandra, and XMM-Newton of Capella (α Aurigae) have encountered problems with the relative intensities of the Fe xviii and Fe xix line emission in the soft-X-ray (XUV) and extreme-ultraviolet spectral ranges versus various model predictions based on theoretical atomic data. The reason may either lie in astrophysical phenomena, e.g., at emission or because of absorption by the interstellar medium, in the theoretical atomic data, in one or more spectrometer calibrations, or in the spectral modeling. By measurements using an electron beam ion trap we provide laboratory data obtained under conditions that are reasonably close to stellar emission regions. The laboratory data on Fe xviii and Fe xix show line ratios that are rather similar to the observations of Capella. The measurements, therefore, rule out astrophysical phenomena and calibration errors and point to issues with the modeling of the observed Capella emission.",10.3847/1538-4357/abef66,Laboratory astrophysics and microanalysis with NTD-germanium-based X-ray microcalorimeters,"With the ability to create cosmic plasma conditions in the laboratory it is possible to investigate the dependencies of key diagnostic X-ray lines on density, temperature, and excitation conditions that exist in astrophysical sources with X-ray optics and a high-resolution X-ray microcalorimeter. The same instrumentation can be coupled to scanning electron microscopes or X-ray fluorescence probes to analyze the elemental and chemical composition of electronic, biological, geological and particulate materials.

This work improves upon our earlier work on these lines by providing measurements at more electron-impact energies (seven values from 846 to 1185 eV), performing an in situ determination of the X-ray window transmission, taking steps to minimize the ion impurity concentrations, correcting the electron energies for space charge shifts, and estimating the residual electron energy uncertainties. The results for the 3C/3D and 3s/3C line ratios are generally in agreement with the closest theory to within 10%, and in agreement with previous measurements from an independent group to within 20%. Better consistency between the two experimental groups is obtained at the lowest electron energies by using theory to interpolate, taking into account the significantly different electron energy distributions. Evidence for resonance collision effects in the spectra is discussed. Renormalized values for the absolute cross sections of the 3C and 3D lines are obtained by combining previously published results and shown to be in agreement with the predictions of converged R-matrix theory. This work establishes consistency between results from independent laboratories and improves the reliability of these lines for astrophysical diagnostics.

A common methodology across several studies involves the use of electron beam ion traps (EBITs) to simulate astrophysical conditions and measure X-ray emissions from HCIs with high precision. For instance, one study utilized a microcalorimeter with a resolving power of ≈1000 and near-perfect quantum efficiency to survey key diagnostic X-ray lines across a broad energy range, comparing laboratory results with theoretical predictions (1). Similarly, another study employed an EBIT to provide laboratory data on Fe XVIII and Fe XIX, resolving discrepancies between observed astrophysical spectra and model predictions, thereby ruling out astrophysical phenomena and calibration errors as the cause (2). The versatility of microcalorimeters is further demonstrated by their integration with X-ray optics for both astrophysical studies and microanalysis of various materials, highlighting their broad applicability (3). Detailed laboratory measurements of Fe XVII emission lines have also been conducted, improving upon previous work by considering a range of electron-impact energies and accounting for factors such as polarization and line blends, thus enhancing the reliability of astrophysical plasma diagnostics (4). Additionally, the detection of X-ray line emission from comet C/1999 S4 (LINEAR) using the Chandra X-ray observatory exemplifies the application of HCI spectral analysis in understanding interactions between solar wind ions and cometary atmospheres (5).

1343,The Sun and the Solar System,Astrophysics and Astronomy,Solar system X-ray  astronomy,The Presence of Dust and Ice Scattering in X-Ray Emissions from Comets,"X-ray emissions from cometary atmospheres were modeled from first principles using the charge-exchange interaction with solar wind ions as well as coherent scattering of solar X-rays from dust and ice grains. Scattering cross-sections were interpolated over the 1 nm–1 cm grain radius range using approximations based on the optically thin or thick nature of grains with different sizes. The theoretical emission model was compared to Chandra observations of Comets ISON and Ikeya–Zhang due to their high signal-to-noise ratios and clearly defined spectral features. Comparing the observed intensities to the model showed that the charge-exchange mechanism accurately reproduced the emission spectra below 1 keV, while dust and ice scattering was negligible. Examining the 1–2 keV range found dust and ice scattering emissions to agree well with observations, while charge-exchange contributions were insignificant. Spectral features between the scattering model and observations also trended similarly over the 1–2 keV range. The dust and ice density within the cometary atmosphere n was varied with respect to grain size a as the function , with Ikeya–Zhang requiring and ISON requiring to best fit the observed spectral intensities. These grain size dependencies agreed with independent observations and simulations of such systems. The overall findings demonstrate evidence of significant scattering emissions present above 1 keV in the analyzed cometary emission spectra and that the dust/ice density dependence on grain radius a may vary significantly between comets.",10.3847/1538-4357/aa9ff2,Spectral analysis of the Chandra comet survey,"Aims.We present results of the analysis of cometary X-ray spectra with an extended version of our charge exchange emission model (Bodewits et al. 2006). We have applied this model to the sample of 8 comets thus far observed with the Chandra X-ray observatory and ACIS spectrometer in the 300-1000 eV range. The surveyed comets are C/1999 S4 (LINEAR), C/1999 T1 (McNaught-Hartley), C/2000 WM1 (LINEAR), 153P/2002 (Ikeya-Zhang), 2P/2003 (Encke), C/2001 Q4 (NEAT), 9P/2005 (Tempel 1) and 73P/2006-B (Schwassmann-Wachmann 3) and the observations include a broad variety of comets, solar wind environments and observational conditions. Methods.The interaction model is based on state selective, velocity dependent charge exchange cross sections and is used to explore how cometary X-ray emission depend on cometary, observational and solar wind characteristics. It is further demonstrated that cometary X-ray spectra mainly reflect the state of the local solar wind. The current sample of Chandra observations was fit using the constrains of the charge exchange model, and relative solar wind abundances were derived from the X-ray spectra. Results.Our analysis showed that spectral differences can be ascribed to different solar wind states, as such identifying comets interacting with (I) fast, cold wind, (II), slow, warm wind and (III) disturbed, fast, hot winds associated with interplanetary coronal mass ejections. We furthermore predict the existence of a fourth spectral class, associated with the cool, fast high latitude wind.",10.1051/0004-6361:20077410,CHANDRA OBSERVATIONS OF COMETS C/2012 S1 (ISON) AND C/2011 L4 (PanSTARRS),"We present our results on the Chandra X-ray Observatory Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) observations of the bright Oort Cloud comets C/2012 S1 (ISON) and C/2011 L4 (PanSTARRS). ISON was observed between 2013 October 31–November 06 during variable speed solar wind (SW), and PanSTARRS was observed between 2013 April 17–23 during fast SW. ISON produced an extended parabolic X-ray morphology consistent with a collisionally thick coma, while PanSTARRS demonstrated only a diffuse X-ray-emitting region. We consider these emissions to be from charge exchange (CX) and model each comet's emission spectrum from first principles accordingly. Our model agrees with the observational spectra and also generates composition ratios for heavy, highly charged SW ions interacting with the cometary atmosphere. We compare our derived SW ion compositions to observational data and find a strong agreement between them. These results further demonstrate the utility of CX emissions as a remote diagnostics tool of both astrophysical plasma interaction and SW composition. In addition, we observe potential soft X-ray emissions via ACIS around 0.2 keV from both comets that are correlated in intensity to the hard X-ray emissions between 0.4–1.0 keV. We fit our CX model to these emissions, but our lack of a unique solution at low energies makes it impossible to conclude if they are cometary CX in origin. Finally, we discuss probable emission mechanism sources for the soft X-rays and explore new opportunities these findings present in understanding cometary emission processes via Chandra.",10.3847/0004-637x/818/2/199,"<i>Chandra</i>Observations of Comet 2P/Encke 2003: First Detection of a Collisionally Thin, Fast Solar Wind Charge Exchange System","We report the results of 15 hr of Chandra observations of comet 2P/Encke 2003 on November 24. X-ray emission from comet Encke was resolved on scales of 500-40,000 km, with unusual morphology due to the presence of a low-density, collisionally thin (to charge exchange) coma. A light curve with peak-to-peak amplitude of 20% consistent with a nucleus rotational period of 11.1 hr was found, further evidence for a collisionally thin coma. We confirm emission lines due to oxygen and neon in the 800-1000 eV range but find very unusual oxygen and carbon line ratios in the 200-700 eV range, evidence for low-density, high effective temperature solar wind composition. We compare the X-ray spectral observation results to contemporaneous measurements of the coma and solar wind made by other means and find good evidence for the dominance of a postshock bubble of expanding solar wind plasma, moving at 600 km s-1 with charge state composition between that of the ""fast"" and ""slow"" solar winds.",10.1086/497570,Charge Exchange-Induced X-Ray Emission from Comet C/1999 S4 (LINEAR),"Using soft x-ray observations of the bright new comet C/1999 S4 (LINEAR) with the Chandra x-ray observatory, we have detected x-ray line emission created by charge exchange between highly ionized solar wind minor ions and neutral gases in the comet's coma.

The charge-exchange interaction with solar wind ions and the scattering of solar X-rays from dust and ice grains have been central to modeling these emissions (1). By interpolating scattering cross-sections across a range of grain sizes and comparing theoretical models to Chandra observations, researchers have been able to discern the relative contributions of charge-exchange mechanisms and dust/ice scattering to the observed X-ray spectra (1). Similarly, an extended charge exchange emission model has been applied to a diverse sample of comets observed by Chandra, revealing how cometary X-ray emission reflects the state of the local solar wind and enabling the classification of comets based on their interaction with different solar wind conditions (2). Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) observations have further refined these models, allowing for the derivation of solar wind ion compositions from the X-ray emission spectra and offering insights into the collisional thickness of cometary comas (3). The detection of a collisionally thin, fast solar wind charge exchange system in comet 2P/Encke 2003 exemplifies the use of spectral observations to infer solar wind composition and the physical state of the cometary coma (4). Lastly, the identification of X-ray line emissions through soft X-ray observations has provided evidence for charge exchange processes between solar wind ions and cometary gases, with emission morphologies and spectra offering clues to the interactions at play (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the intricate relationship between cometary X-ray emissions, solar wind properties, and the physical characteristics of cometary atmospheres, advancing our understanding of the complex processes governing X-ray astronomy within our solar system (1-5).","{

}","Recent studies in solar system X-ray astronomy have revealed that X-ray emissions from cometary atmospheres are influenced by a combination of charge exchange interactions with solar wind ions and scattering from dust and ice grains (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory have been instrumental in analyzing these emissions, with spectral analysis indicating that the charge exchange mechanism is the primary contributor to emissions below 1 keV, while scattering becomes significant above this energy range (1). The spectral differences observed across various comets can be attributed to the varying states of the solar wind, with some comets interacting with fast, cold wind, others with slow, warm wind, and some with disturbed, fast, hot winds from coronal mass ejections (2). The morphology and intensity of X-ray emissions also reflect the density and composition of the cometary comas, which can be collisionally thick or thin depending on the solar wind conditions (3, 4). Furthermore, the detection of X-ray line emissions has provided insights into the interactions between highly ionized solar wind ions and neutral gases in the cometary coma, with the potential to use these emissions as diagnostic tools for understanding both the solar wind and cometary environments (3, 5). These findings collectively enhance our understanding of the complex interactions between comets and the solar wind, contributing to the broader field of planetary science and astrophysics.","{

}","In the realm of solar system X-ray astronomy, recent studies have provided insights into the mechanisms behind X-ray emissions from cometary atmospheres. The first paper (1) presents a model incorporating charge-exchange interactions and scattering from dust and ice, finding that charge-exchange accurately reproduces spectra below 1 keV, while scattering is significant above 1 keV, as confirmed by Chandra observations of Comets ISON and Ikeya–Zhang. The second paper (2) extends a charge exchange emission model to analyze Chandra X-ray spectra of eight comets, revealing that spectral differences correspond to varying solar wind conditions and suggesting a new spectral class linked to high latitude winds. The third study (3) discusses Chandra observations of comets ISON and PanSTARRS, using charge exchange modeling to derive solar wind ion compositions, and explores the potential of soft X-ray emissions as a diagnostic tool, despite uncertainties at lower energies. The fourth paper (4) reports on Chandra observations of comet 2P/Encke, detecting a collisionally thin coma and unusual X-ray spectral features indicative of a unique solar wind composition, suggesting the influence of a postshock solar wind bubble. Lastly, the fifth paper (5) identifies X-ray line emissions in comet C/1999 S4 (LINEAR) due to charge exchange processes, with a morphology and spectrum influenced by solar wind ions, and notes a correlation between X-ray emissions and solar flare activity. Collectively, these studies (1-5) enhance our understanding of the interactions between cometary atmospheres and the solar wind, contributing to the broader field of planetary X-ray astronomy.","{

}","The study of Solar System X-ray astronomy involves modeling and analyzing X-ray emissions from comets using various methodologies. Paper 1 focused on the interaction between solar wind ions and dust and ice grains in cometary atmospheres, employing a theoretical emission model that considered charge-exchange mechanisms and coherent scattering of solar X-rays (1). The authors compared their findings to Chandra observations of Comets ISON and Ikeya–Zhang, revealing significant scattering emissions above 1 keV and varying dust/ice density dependencies on grain size (1).

Papers 2 and 3 utilized the Chandra X-ray observatory to analyze cometary X-ray spectra from a sample of eight comets. Paper 2 applied an extended charge exchange emission model, identifying spectral differences due to different solar wind states (2), while Paper 3 observed unusual morphologies and emission lines in comets ISON and PanSTARRS, attributing them to charge exchange interactions between highly ionized solar wind minor ions and neutral gases (3).

Paper 4 reported on Chandra observations of Comet 2P/Encke 2003, revealing a low-density, collisionally thin coma with unusual oxygen and carbon line ratios, suggesting evidence for a postshock bubble of expanding solar wind plasma (4). Lastly, Paper 5 detected charge exchange-induced X-ray emission from Comet C/1999 S4 (LINEAR), observing symmetrically crescent-shaped morphology and identifying emission lines attributable to electron capture and radiative deexcitation by solar wind species (5).

These studies collectively demonstrate the importance of charge exchange interactions in understanding cometary X-ray emissions, revealing significant variations in solar wind states and compositions. The methodologies employed in these papers contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of Solar System X-ray astronomy.","{

We present the results of Chandra X-ray Observatory Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) observations of the bright Oort Cloud comets C/2012 S1 (ISON) and C/2011 L4 (PanSTARRS).

Our model agrees with the observational spectra and generates composition ratios for heavy, highly charged solar wind ions interacting with the cometary atmosphere. We also discuss potential soft X-ray emissions around 0.2 keV from both comets that are correlated in intensity to the hard X-ray emissions between 0.4–1.0 keV and explore new opportunities these findings present in understanding cometary emission processes via Chandra.

Abstract:
We present the results of Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of three comets, C/2012 S1 (ISON), C/2011 L4 (PanSTARRS), and 2P/Encke (2003). The X-ray emission from these comets is due to charge exchange (CX) between highly charged solar wind ions and neutral gases in the coma. We model each comet's emission spectrum using first principles CX theory, and compare our results with observational data to derive SW ion compositions. ISON was observed during variable speed solar wind, producing an extended parabolic X-ray morphology consistent with a collisionally thick coma. PanSTARRS was observed during fast solar wind conditions, demonstrating only a diffuse X-ray-emitting region. Encke was observed during slow solar wind and showed unusual morphology due to the presence of a collisionally thin (to CX) coma. We discuss potential emission mechanism sources for soft X-rays detected around 0.2 keV from ISON and PanSTARRS, and explore new opportunities these findings present in understanding cometary emission processes via Chandra.

5. Discussion:
- Interpret the implications of our findings for understanding cometary emission processes and plasma interactions with the solar wind.

PL intensity measurements indicate that these CDs have many advantages over alternative semiconductor- and CD-based nanoscale temperature sensors. Importantly, their PL lifetimes remain constant over wide ranges of pH values (5-12), CD concentrations (1.5 × 10-5 to 0.5 mg/mL), and environmental ionic strengths (up to 0.7 mol·L-1 NaCl). Moreover, they are biocompatible and nontoxic, as demonstrated by cell viability and flow cytometry analyses using NIH/3T3 and HeLa cell lines. N,S-CD thermal sensors also exhibit good water dispersibility, superior photo- and thermostability, extraordinary environment and concentration independence, high storage stability, and reusability-their PL decay curves at temperatures between 15 and 45 °C remained unchanged over seven sequential experiments. In vitro PL lifetime-based temperature sensing performed with human cervical cancer HeLa cells demonstrated the great potential of these nanosensors in biomedicine.

Fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) doped with various elements such as nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and boron (B) have emerged as promising candidates for this application due to their stable luminescence and sensitivity to temperature changes (1, 2, 4, 5). These nanothermometers exhibit a linear response to temperature variations, with the potential for both in vitro and in vivo applications, including intracellular temperature sensing (1, 2, 3). The fluorescence intensity or lifetime of these CDs decreases with increasing temperature, a reversible process that allows for continuous monitoring (1, 2). Notably, the performance of these nanothermometers is not significantly affected by variations in pH, ionic strength, or probe concentration, ensuring their reliability under diverse biological conditions (2). Additionally, some CDs have been engineered to serve dual functions, such as sensing temperature and detecting specific metal ions like Fe2+ and Fe3+, which is valuable for bioanalysis (4). The high quantum yield and selectivity of these CDs further enhance their utility as bio-imaging probes for tracking intracellular temperature and other analytes, such as tetracycline, demonstrating their multifunctional capabilities (4, 5). Overall, the development of these nanothermometers represents a significant step forward in the field of nanoscale thermal sensing, with broad implications for biology and medicine (1-5).","{

1087,Environmental Sciences,Earth Sciences,Predicting soil properties with Multiple Linear Regression (MLR),Spatial prediction of organic carbon in German agricultural topsoil using machine learning algorithms,"Abstract. As the largest terrestrial carbon pool, soil organic carbon (SOC) has the
potential to influence and mitigate climate change; thus, SOC monitoring is of high importance
in the frameworks of various international treaties. Therefore, high-resolution SOC maps are required. Machine learning (ML) offers new
opportunities to develop these maps due to its ability to data mine large
datasets. The aim of this study was to apply three algorithms commonly used
in digital soil mapping – random forest (RF), boosted regression trees
(BRT), and support vector machine for regression (SVR) – on the first German
agricultural soil inventory to model the agricultural topsoil (0–30 cm) SOC
content and develop a two-model approach to address the high variability in
SOC in German agricultural soils. Model performance is often limited by the
size and quality of the soil dataset available for calibration and
validation. Therefore, the impact of enlarging the training dataset was tested
by including data from the European Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey
for agricultural sites in Germany. Nested cross-validation was implemented
for model evaluation and parameter tuning. Grid search and the differential
evolution algorithm were also applied to ensure that each algorithm was
appropriately tuned . The SOC content of the German agricultural soil
inventory was highly variable, ranging from 4 to 480 g kg−1. However, only 4 % of all soils contained more than 87 g kg−1 SOC and were considered organic or degraded organic soils. The
results showed that SVR produced the best performance, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 32 g kg−1 when the algorithms were trained on the full dataset. However, the
average RMSE of all algorithms decreased by 34 % when mineral and organic
soils were modelled separately, with the best result from SVR presenting an RMSE of
21 g kg−1. The model performance was enhanced by up to 1 % for
mineral soils and by up to 2 % for organic soils. Despite the ability of machine
learning algorithms, in general, and SVR, in particular, to model SOC on a
national scale, the study showed that the most important aspect for
improving the model performance was to separate the modelling of mineral and
organic soils.",10.5194/soil-8-587-2022,Multivariate mapping of soil with structural equation modelling: Multivariate soil mapping using SEM,"In a previous study we introduced structural equation modelling (SEM) for digital soil mapping in the Argentine Pampas. An attractive property of SEM is that it incorporates pedological knowledge explicitly through a mathematical implementation of a conceptual model. Many soil processes operate within the soil profile; therefore, SEM might be suitable for simultaneous prediction of soil properties for multiple soil layers. In this way, relations between soil properties in different horizons can be included that might result in more consistent predictions. The objectives of this study were therefore to apply SEM to multi‐layer and multivariate soil mapping, and to test SEM functionality for suggestions to improve the modelling. We applied SEM to model and predict the lateral and vertical distribution of the cation exchange capacity (CEC), organic carbon (OC) and clay content of three major soil horizons, A, B and C, for a 23 000‐km2 region in the Argentine Pampas. We developed a conceptual model based on pedological hypotheses. Next, we derived a mathematical model and calibrated it with environmental covariates and soil data from 320 soil profiles. Cross‐validation of predicted soil properties showed that SEM explained only marginally more of the variance than a linear regression model. However, assessment of the covariation showed that SEM reproduces the covariance between variables much more accurately than linear regression. We concluded that SEM can be used to predict several soil properties in multiple layers by considering the interrelations between soil properties and layers.",10.1111/ejss.12446,Assessing soil organic carbon stocks under current and potential forest cover using digital soil mapping and spatial generalisation,"Forest soils are important components in the global C-cycle. Regional soil organic carbon (SOC) stock assessments are hampered by low spatial densities of routine soil inventories. In this study, we estimated the SOC stock in the upper meter of forest in the region of Flanders (N. Belgium) using four digital soil mapping techniques, i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR), boosted regression trees (BRT), artificial neural networks (ANN) and least-squares support vector machines (LS-SVM), and compared them with the results of a multi-level spatial generalisation (MLSG) approach.

Applied to a collection of 276 soil profiles, we identified the highest groundwater level, clay fraction, tree genus and soil type as key predictors of the SOC stock in the upper 100 cm under forests. Overall, BRT was the most informative as it obtained the best fit (training R2 of 0.68, cross-validated R2 of 0.22) and provided insights in the soil system by showing average predictor effects in partial dependence plots. With BRT, the total stock in the upper meter of forest soil (153,544 ha) was estimated to be 26.99 Mt OC, or 17.58 kg m−2 on average. MLSG provided an estimate for only 90% of the forest area and resulted in a larger average stock of 18.22 kg m−2 due to larger predictions for Histosols. As a null model, i.e. assuming that the potential natural dominant tree genus would occur according to the present soil conditions, the SOC stock in the current forest area was estimated at 30.00 Mt OC, or 21.26 kg OC m−2 on average. When the complete non-built-up territory (1,168,850 ha) would be forested analogously, 255.28 Mt OC would be stored, which is more than double the amount of predictions under the actual land cover. The results highlight the importance to conserve and restore carbon hotspots like alluvial forests. New soil inventories should focus on these and other data-scarce land units. Future modelling approaches can benefit from explicitly taking the soil type and tree genus into account as predictors.status: publishe",10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.02.010,Combining Variable Selection and Multiple Linear Regression for Soil Organic Matter and Total Nitrogen Estimation by DRIFT-MIR Spectroscopy,"The successful estimation of soil organic matter (SOM) and soil total nitrogen (TN) contents with mid-infrared (MIR) reflectance spectroscopy depends on selecting appropriate variable selection techniques and multivariate methods for regression analysis. This study aimed to explore the potential of combining a multivariate method and spectral variable selection for soil SOM and TN estimation using MIR spectroscopy. Five hundred and ten topsoil samples were collected from Quzhou County, Hebei Province, China, and their SOM and TN contents and reflectance spectra were measured using DRIFT-MIR spectroscopy (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform in the mid-infrared range, MIR, wavenumber: 4000–400 cm−1; wavelength: 2500–25,000 nm). Two multivariate methods (partial least-squares regression, PLSR; multiple linear regression, MLR) combined with two variable selection techniques (stability competitive adaptive reweighted sampling, sCARS; bootstrapping soft shrinkage approach, BOSS) were used for model calibration. The MLR model combined with the sCARS method yielded the most accurate estimation result for both SOM (Rp2 = 0.72 and RPD = 1.89) and TN (Rp2 = 0.84 and RPD = 2.50). Out of the 2382 wavenumbers in a full spectrum, sCARS determined that only 31 variables were important for SOM estimation (accounting for 1.30% of all variables) and 27 variables were important for TN estimation (accounting for 1.13% of all variables). The results demonstrated that sCARS was a highly efficient approach for extracting information on wavenumbers and mitigating redundant wavenumbers. In addition, the current study indicated that MLR, which is simpler than PLSR, when combined with spectral variable selection, can achieve high-precision prediction of SOM and TN content. As such, DRIFT-MIR spectroscopy coupled with MLR and sCARS is a good alternative for estimating the SOM and TN of soils.",10.3390/agronomy12030638,Multi-predictor mapping of soil organic carbon in the alpine tundra: a case study for the central Ecuadorian páramo,"Abstract
Background
Soil organic carbon (SOC) affects essential biological, biochemical, and physical soil functions such as nutrient cycling, water retention, water distribution, and soil structure stability. The Andean páramo known as such a high carbon and water storage capacity ecosystem is a complex, heterogeneous and remote ecosystem complicating field studies to collect SOC data. Here, we propose a multi-predictor remote quantification of SOC using Random Forest Regression to map SOC stock in the herbaceous páramo of the Chimborazo province, Ecuador.

Results
Spectral indices derived from the Landsat-8 (L8) sensors, OLI and TIRS, topographic, geological, soil taxonomy and climate variables were used in combination with 500 in situ SOC sampling data for training and calibrating a suitable predictive SOC model. The final predictive model selected uses nine predictors with a RMSE of 1.72% and a R2 of 0.82 for SOC expressed in weight %, a RMSE of 25.8 Mg/ha and a R2 of 0.77 for the model in units of Mg/ha. Satellite-derived indices such as VARIG, SLP, NDVI, NDWI, SAVI, EVI2, WDRVI, NDSI, NDMI, NBR and NBR2 were not found to be strong SOC predictors. Relevant predictors instead were in order of importance: geological unit, soil taxonomy, precipitation, elevation, orientation, slope length and steepness (LS Factor), Bare Soil Index (BI), average annual temperature and TOA Brightness Temperature.

Conclusions
Variables such as the BI index derived from satellite images and the LS factor from the DEM increase the SOC mapping accuracy. The mapping results show that over 57% of the study area contains high concentrations of SOC, between 150 and 205 Mg/ha, positioning the herbaceous páramo as an ecosystem of global importance. The results obtained with this study can be used to extent the SOC mapping in the whole herbaceous ecosystem of Ecuador offering an efficient and accurate methodology without the need for intensive in situ sampling.",10.1186/s13021-021-00195-2,"The methodologies employed across the five studies for predicting soil properties using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and other techniques reveal a diverse approach to digital soil mapping and the estimation of soil organic carbon (SOC) and other soil properties. In the first study, machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), and Support Vector Machine for regression (SVR) were applied to a large dataset, with nested cross-validation and algorithm tuning through grid search and differential evolution to enhance model performance, particularly by separating mineral and organic soils (1). The second study introduced Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to account for the covariance between soil properties across different layers, suggesting that SEM can predict multiple soil properties more consistently than linear regression by incorporating pedological knowledge (2). The third study compared MLR with BRT, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Least-Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM), identifying key predictors for SOC stock and highlighting the importance of considering soil type and tree genus in models (3). The fourth study combined MLR with spectral variable selection techniques, demonstrating that a simpler MLR model, when paired with an efficient variable selection method like stability competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (sCARS), can yield accurate predictions for soil organic matter and total nitrogen (4). Lastly, the fifth study utilized Random Forest Regression with multiple predictors, including geological and climatic variables, to map SOC in a complex ecosystem, showing that variables like the Bare Soil Index and the LS factor can significantly increase mapping accuracy (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the importance of integrating various predictors, algorithm tuning, and the consideration of soil heterogeneity to improve the accuracy of soil property predictions using MLR and other advanced statistical methods.","{

}","Recent studies have highlighted the potential of Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and other machine learning techniques in predicting soil properties, emphasizing the importance of selecting appropriate predictors and modeling strategies. The spatial prediction of soil organic carbon (SOC) using MLR and other algorithms such as Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine for regression (SVR) has been explored, with SVR often outperforming others when datasets are sufficiently large and diverse (1). However, the separation of mineral and organic soils has been shown to significantly improve model performance (1). Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) has been introduced as an alternative approach that incorporates pedological knowledge and can predict multiple soil properties across different layers, although its advantages over MLR are marginal in terms of explained variance (2). In the context of forest soils, MLR has been compared with techniques like Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), with BRT providing the best fit and insights into the soil system, although MLR remains a viable option for SOC stock assessments (3). Combining MLR with spectral variable selection techniques has proven effective for estimating soil organic matter and total nitrogen, demonstrating that MLR can achieve high-precision predictions when paired with efficient variable selection (4). Finally, in remote and heterogeneous ecosystems such as the Andean páramo, MLR has been successfully applied using a multi-predictor approach, incorporating geological, climatic, and topographic variables to map SOC with high accuracy, highlighting the ecosystem's global importance for carbon storage (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the versatility of MLR in soil property prediction, while also pointing to the benefits of integrating it with other methods and variable selection techniques to enhance prediction accuracy (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).","{

This leads to challenges being encountered with some land covers classes, especially in wetlands classes. In this study, satellite images from the Sentinel 2B by ESA (European Space Agency) were used to classify the land cover of Al‑Hawizeh marsh/Iraq‑Iran border. Three classification methods were used aimed at comparing their accuracy, using multispectral satellite images with a spatial resolution of 10 m. The classification process was performed using three different algorithms, namely: Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The classification algorithms were carried out using ENVI 5.1 software to detect six land cover classes: deep water marsh, shallow water marsh, marsh vegetation (aquatic vegetation), urban area (built‑up area), agriculture area, and barren soil. The results showed that the MLC method applied to Sentinel 2B images provides a higher overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient compared to the ANN and SVM methods. Overall accuracy values for MLC, ANN, and SVM methods were 85.32%, 70.64%, and 77.01% respectively.",10.7494/geom.2021.15.1.5,Identification of Winter Land Use in Temperate Agricultural Landscapes based on Sentinel-1 and 2 Times-Series,"Land cover and land use monitoring, particularly during winter season, is still a major environmental and scientific issue in agricultural areas. From an environmental point of view, the presence and type of vegetation cover in winter have an impact on pollutant transport to water bodies. From a methodological point of view, characterizing spatio-temporal dynamics of winter land cover and land use at a field scale remains a challenge due to the diversity of farming strategies and practices. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of optical and SAR time-series to improve the monitoring of winter land use in an area of 130 km2. For that purpose, Sentinel-1 and 2 time-series were classified using SVM and RF algorithms. Winter land use was identified with an overall accuracy of 81% and a kappa index of 0.77 from a combination of Sentinel-1 and 2 images.",10.1109/igarss.2018.8517673,Land-Cover and Land-Use Classification Based on Multitemporal Sentinel-2 Data,"In this paper, we focus on the analysis of multitemporal Sentinel-2 data for land-cover and land-use classification. Given a set of representative training areas, we use a Random Forest classifier for the semantic labeling of the considered scene with respect to seven classes. As the classifier allows assessing the relevance of involved features for the classification task, we also estimate the relevance of the spectral channels for different dates. The derived results clearly reveal the benefit of a multitemporal analysis of Sentinel-2 data, since it also addresses seasonal changes in the acquired data.",10.1109/igarss.2018.8519301,Sentinel-2 Data for Land Use Mapping: Comparing Different Supervised Classifications in Semi-Arid Areas,"Mapping and monitoring land use (LU) changes is one of the most effective ways to understand and manage land transformation. The main objectives of this study were to classify LU using supervised classification methods and to assess the effectiveness of various machine learning methods. The current investigation was conducted in the Nord-Est area of Tunisia, and an optical satellite image covering the study area was acquired from Sentinel-2. For LU mapping, we tested three machine learning models algorithms: Random Forest (RF), K-Dimensional Trees K-Nearest Neighbors (KDTree-KNN) and Minimum Distance Classification (MDC). According to our research, the RF classification provided a better result than other classification models. RF classification exhibited the best values of overall accuracy, kappa, recall, precision and RMSE, with 99.54%, 0.98%, 0.98%, 0.98% and 0.23%, respectively. However, low precision was observed for the MDC method (RMSE = 1.15). The results were more intriguing since they highlighted the value of the bare soil index as a covariate for LU mapping. Our results suggest that Sentinel-2 combined with RF classification is efficient for creating a LU map.",10.3390/agriculture12091429,The effect of fusing Sentinel-2 bands on land-cover classification,"ABSTRACT The Sentinel-2 satellite currently provides freely available multispectral bands at relatively high spatial resolution but does not acquire the panchromatic band. To improve the resolution of 20 m bands to 10 m, existing pansharpening methods (Brovey transform [BT], intensity–hue–saturation [IHS], principal component analysis [PCA], the variational method [P + XS], and the wavelet method) required adjustment, which was achieved using higher resolution multispectral bands in the role of a panchromatic band to fuse bands at a lower spatial resolution. After preprocessing, six bands at lower resolution were divided into two groups because some image fusion methods (e.g. BT, IHS) are limited to a maximum of three input bands of a lower resolution at a time. With respect to the spectral range, the higher resolution band for the first group was synthesized from bands 4 and 8, and band 8 was selected for the second group. Given that one of the main remote sensing applications is land-cover classification, the classification accuracy of the fusion methods was assessed as well as the comparison with reference bands and pixels. The supervised classification methods were Maximum Likelihood Classifier, artificial neural networks, and object-based image analysis. The classification scheme contained five classes: water, built-up, bare soil, low vegetation, and forest. The results showed that most of the fusion methods, particularly P + XS and PCA, improved the overall classification accuracy, especially for the classes of forest, low vegetation, and bare soil and in the detection of coastlines. The least satisfying results were obtained from the wavelet method.",10.1080/01431161.2017.1392640,"The methodologies employed in the five studies for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) mapping using Sentinel-2 data reveal a variety of approaches to address the spectral similarity challenges in different environments. In the marshlands, supervised classification methods such as Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were compared, with MLC providing the highest accuracy (1). In temperate agricultural landscapes, the integration of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time-series data with SVM and Random Forest (RF) algorithms achieved substantial accuracy, demonstrating the value of combining optical and SAR data for winter land use identification (2). Multitemporal analysis using RF classifiers highlighted the importance of temporal dynamics, with the classifier's feature relevance assessment revealing the benefit of considering seasonal changes (3). In semi-arid areas, machine learning models like RF, K-Dimensional Trees K-Nearest Neighbors (KDTree-KNN), and Minimum Distance Classification (MDC) were tested, with RF outperforming others, emphasizing the utility of the bare soil index as a covariate (4). Lastly, the fusion of Sentinel-2 bands using methods such as the variational method (P + XS) and principal component analysis (PCA) improved classification accuracy, particularly for forest, low vegetation, and bare soil classes, although the wavelet method showed less satisfactory results (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the effectiveness of combining different classification algorithms, data fusion techniques, and the incorporation of temporal and spectral information to enhance the accuracy of LULC mapping using Sentinel-2 data.","{

}",,"Sentinel-2 data has emerged as a valuable resource for land use and land cover (LULC) mapping due to its multispectral capabilities and high spatial resolution. Several studies have explored various approaches to utilizing this data for LULC classification, revealing common themes and patterns.

Firstly, different supervised classification methods, such as Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K-Dimensional Trees K-Nearest Neighbors (KDTree-KNN), have been employed to map LULC using Sentinel-2 data. These methods have shown varying degrees of success, with some providing higher overall accuracy and kappa coefficients than others (1, 3, 4).

Secondly, the use of multitemporal Sentinel-2 data has proven beneficial for LULC classification due to seasonal changes in the acquired data. This approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of LULC dynamics (3).

Thirdly, fusing Sentinel-2 bands can improve the resolution and accuracy of LULC mapping. Various methods, such as Brovey transform (BT), intensity–hue–saturation (IHS), principal component analysis (PCA), the variational method (P + XS), and wavelet method, have been employed for band fusion (5).

Lastly, the value of using additional covariates, such as a bare soil index, has been highlighted in LULC mapping using Sentinel-2 data. This approach can enhance the accuracy of classification models, particularly for specific classes like bare soil and low vegetation (4).

We specifically focus on the role of day care center and school closures, which may be regarded as a “disruptive exogenous shock” to family life. We make use of a novel representative survey of parental well-being collected in May and June 2020 in Germany, when schools and day care centers were closed but while other measures had been relaxed and new infections were low. In our descriptive analysis, we compare well-being during this period with a pre-crisis period for different groups. In a difference-in-differences design, we compare the change for individuals with children to the change for individuals without children, accounting for unrelated trends as well as potential survey mode and context effects. We find that the crisis lowered the relative well-being of individuals with children, especially for individuals with young children, for women, and for persons with lower secondary schooling qualifications. Our results suggest that public policy measures taken to contain Covid-19 can have large effects on family well-being, with implications for child development and parental labor market outcomes.",10.1007/s11150-020-09529-4,Individual differences and changes in subjective wellbeing during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has considerably impacted many people's lives. This study examined changes in subjective wellbeing between December 2019 and May 2020 and how stress appraisals and coping strategies relate to individual differences and changes in subjective wellbeing during the early stages of the pandemic. Data were collected at 4 time points from 979 individuals in Germany. Results showed that, on average, life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect did not change significantly between December 2019 and March 2020 but decreased between March and May 2020. Across the latter timespan, individual differences in life satisfaction were positively related to controllability appraisals, active coping, and positive reframing, and negatively related to threat and centrality appraisals and planning. Positive affect was positively related to challenge and controllable-by-self appraisals, active coping, using emotional support, and religion, and negatively related to threat appraisal and humor. Negative affect was positively related to threat and centrality appraisals, denial, substance use, and self-blame, and negatively related to controllability appraisals and emotional support. Contrary to expectations, the effects of stress appraisals and coping strategies on changes in subjective wellbeing were small and mostly nonsignificant. These findings imply that the COVID-19 pandemic represents not only a major medical and economic crisis, but also has a psychological dimension, as it can be associated with declines in key facets of people's subjective wellbeing. Psychological practitioners should address potential declines in subjective wellbeing with their clients and attempt to enhance clients' general capability to use functional stress appraisals and effective coping strategies.

The data is from 2 surveys of 1,143 adults from RAND Corporation's nationally representative American Life Panel, the first administered between April-June, 2019 and the second during the initial peak of the pandemic in the United States in April, 2020. Depressive symptoms during the pandemic were higher than population norms before the pandemic. Depressive symptoms increased from before to during COVID-19 and life satisfaction decreased. Individuals with higher education experienced a greater increase in depressive symptoms and a greater decrease in life satisfaction from before to during COVID-19 in comparison to those with lower education. Supplemental analysis illustrates that income had a curvilinear relationship with changes in well-being, such that individuals at the highest levels of income experienced a greater decrease in life satisfaction from before to during COVID-19 than individuals with lower levels of income. We draw on conservation of resources theory and the theory of fundamental social causes to examine four key mechanisms (perceived financial resources, perceived control, interpersonal resources, and COVID-19-related knowledge/news consumption) underlying the relationship between SES and well-being during COVID-19. These resources explained changes in well-being for the sample as a whole but did not provide insight into why individuals of higher education experienced a greater decline in well-being from before to during COVID-19.

Objectives
To investigate early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic related to (a) levels of worry, risk perception, and social distancing; (b) longitudinal effects on well-being; and (c) effects of worry, risk perception, and social distancing on well-being.


Methods
We analyzed annual changes in four aspects of well-being over 5 years (2015–2020): life satisfaction, financial satisfaction, self-rated health, and loneliness in a subsample (n = 1,071, aged 65–71) from a larger survey of Swedish older adults. The 2020 wave, collected March 26–April 2, included measures of worry, risk perception, and social distancing in response to COVID-19.


Results
(a) In relation to COVID-19: 44.9% worried about health, 69.5% about societal consequences, 25.1% about financial consequences; 86.4% perceived a high societal risk, 42.3% a high risk of infection, and 71.2% reported high levels of social distancing. (b) Well-being remained stable (life satisfaction and loneliness) or even increased (self-rated health and financial satisfaction) in 2020 compared to previous years. (c) More worry about health and financial consequences was related to lower scores in all four well-being measures. Higher societal worry and more social distancing were related to higher well-being.


Discussion
In the early stage of the pandemic, Swedish older adults on average rated their well-being as high as, or even higher than, previous years. However, those who worried more reported lower well-being. Our findings speak to the resilience, but also heterogeneity, among older adults during the pandemic. Further research, on a broad range of health factors and long-term psychological consequences, is needed.",10.1093/geronb/gbaa084,"The methodologies employed across five studies investigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on well-being reveal a diverse approach to understanding this multifaceted issue. The first study utilized a novel representative survey and a difference-in-differences design to assess the impact of school and day care center closures on parental well-being in Germany, comparing individuals with and without children (1). Similarly, the second study conducted a longitudinal analysis, collecting data at four time points to examine changes in subjective well-being and the role of stress appraisals and coping strategies among German individuals (2). The third study drew on two surveys from the American Life Panel to assess within-person changes in psychological well-being by socioeconomic status in the United States, applying theories of resource conservation and fundamental social causes to interpret the findings (3). In contrast, the fourth study focused on the impact of state-wide stay-at-home orders on mental health in the US, quantifying the effect size and identifying gender disparities through real-time survey data (4). Lastly, the fifth study analyzed annual changes in well-being over five years, incorporating measures specific to COVID-19 such as worry, risk perception, and social distancing, to understand the pandemic's early effects on Swedish older adults (5). Collectively, these methodologies—ranging from descriptive analyses and longitudinal designs to resource-based examinations—provide a comprehensive picture of the pandemic's impact on well-being across different demographics and geographies, highlighting the importance of temporal and contextual factors in such research (1-5).","{

}","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a multifaceted impact on well-being, with evidence suggesting that the imposition of lockdowns and social distancing measures has led to a decline in mental health and subjective well-being across various demographics. In Germany, parents with dependent children, particularly women and those with lower educational qualifications, experienced a significant decrease in well-being due to the closure of schools and day care centers, highlighting the pandemic's disruptive effect on family life (1). Similarly, in the United States, women's mental health deteriorated more than men's as a result of lockdown measures, exacerbating the pre-existing gender gap in mental health (4). This decline in well-being was not uniform; individuals with higher socioeconomic status (SES) in the U.S. reported greater increases in depressive symptoms and decreases in life satisfaction compared to those with lower SES, suggesting that perceived financial resources, control, and interpersonal resources play a role in these changes (3). However, the overall psychological impact of the pandemic was nuanced, as subjective well-being measures such as life satisfaction and affect in Germany initially remained stable but later declined, with individual differences in stress appraisals and coping strategies showing limited influence on these changes (2). In contrast, older adults in Sweden demonstrated resilience, with many reporting stable or even improved well-being, although increased worry about health and financial consequences was associated with lower well-being (5). These findings underscore the complex and heterogeneous effects of the pandemic on well-being, necessitating targeted public policy and psychological interventions to mitigate its negative consequences (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).","{

}","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the well-being of individuals across different demographics has been significantly affected, with research highlighting various contributing factors and outcomes. In Germany, the closure of schools and day care centers was found to disproportionately lower the well-being of parents, particularly affecting women, individuals with young children, and those with lower educational qualifications (1). Another study in Germany observed that while subjective well-being remained stable in the initial months of the pandemic, it declined between March and May 2020, with individual differences in coping strategies and stress appraisals only marginally influencing these changes (2). In the United States, a study using the American Life Panel indicated that depressive symptoms increased and life satisfaction decreased during the pandemic, with individuals of higher education experiencing a greater decline in well-being, a trend not fully explained by financial resources, perceived control, interpersonal resources, or COVID-19-related knowledge/news consumption (3). Contrasting these findings, evidence from the US highlighted that lockdown measures significantly lowered mental health, with the negative impact being entirely driven by women, exacerbating the existing gender gap in mental health (4). Meanwhile, a longitudinal study of older Swedish adults revealed a remarkable resilience, with well-being remaining stable or even improving during the early stages of the pandemic, although increased worry about health and financial consequences was associated with lower well-being (5). These studies collectively underscore the complex and varied effects of the pandemic on well-being, influenced by factors such as family structure, socioeconomic status, gender, and age.","{

}","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted individuals' well-being across various sociodemographic groups and contexts. Three studies from Germany and the United States provide insights into this issue by examining changes in subjective well-being and its determinants during the early stages of the pandemic (Studies 1, 3, and 5).

In Study 1, researchers investigated worry, risk perception, social distancing, and their effects on well-being among Swedish older adults. They found that while overall well-being remained stable or even improved in 2020 compared to previous years, those who reported more worry about health and financial consequences experienced lower well-being (Study 5).

Another study from the United States focused on mental health during state-wide lockdowns, revealing a significant negative impact on mental health overall, with women being disproportionately affected (Study 4).

A third study examined changes in depressive symptoms and life satisfaction among individuals in the United States by socioeconomic status (SES) before and during the pandemic. Results showed that individuals with higher education experienced a greater increase in depressive symptoms and decrease in life satisfaction compared to those with lower education (Study 3).

Additionally, Study 2 from the United States investigated gender differences in mental health impacts of lockdown measures, revealing a larger negative effect on women's mental health.

These studies highlight the importance of understanding the complex relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and well-being across various populations and contexts. Further research is needed to explore long-term psychological consequences and a broader range of health factors.","{

1151,Computational Linguistics,Linguistics,Multilingual named entity recognition,Multilingual named entity recognition using parallel data and metadata from wikipedia,In this paper we propose a method to automatically label multi-lingual data with named entity tags. We build on prior work utilizing Wikipedia metadata and show how to effectively combine the weak annotations stemming from Wikipedia metadata with information obtained through English-foreign language parallel Wikipedia sentences. The combination is achieved using a novel semi-CRF model for foreign sentence tagging in the context of a parallel English sentence. The model outperforms both standard annotation projection methods and methods based solely on Wikipedia metadata.,,Named Entity Recognition in Wikipedia,"Named entity recognition (NER) is used in many domains beyond the newswire text that comprises current gold-standard corpora. Recent work has used Wikipedia's link structure to automatically generate near gold-standard annotations. Until now, these resources have only been evaluated on newswire corpora or themselves. 
 
We present the first NER evaluation on a Wikipedia gold standard (WG) corpus. Our analysis of cross-corpus performance on WG shows that Wikipedia text may be a harder NER domain than newswire. We find that an automatic annotation of Wikipedia has high agreement with WG and, when used as training data, outperforms newswire models by up to 7.7%.",,WEXEA: Wikipedia EXhaustive Entity Annotation,"Building predictive models for information extraction from text, such as named entity recognition or the extraction of semantic relationships between named entities in text, requires a large corpus of annotated text. Wikipedia is often used as a corpus for these tasks where the annotation is a named entity linked by a hyperlink to its article. However, editors on Wikipedia are only expected to link these mentions in order to help the reader to understand the content, but are discouraged from adding links that do not add any benefit for understanding an article. Therefore, many mentions of popular entities (such as countries or popular events in history), or previously linked articles, as well as the article’s entity itself, are not linked. In this paper, we discuss WEXEA, a Wikipedia EXhaustive Entity Annotation system, to create a text corpus based on Wikipedia with exhaustive annotations of entity mentions, i.e. linking all mentions of entities to their corresponding articles. This results in a huge potential for additional annotations that can be used for downstream NLP tasks, such as Relation Extraction. We show that our annotations are useful for creating distantly supervised datasets for this task. Furthermore, we publish all code necessary to derive a corpus from a raw Wikipedia dump, so that it can be reproduced by everyone.",,Mining Wiki Resources for Multilingual Named Entity Recognition,"In this paper, we describe a system by which the multilingual characteristics of Wikipedia can be utilized to annotate a large corpus of text with Named Entity Recognition (NER) tags requiring minimal human intervention and no linguistic expertise. This process, though of value in languages for which resources exist, is particularly useful for less commonly taught languages. We show how the Wikipedia format can be used to identify possible named entities and discuss in detail the process by which we use the Category structure inherent to Wikipedia to determine the named entity type of a proposed entity. We further describe the methods by which English language data can be used to bootstrap the NER process in other languages. We demonstrate the system by using the generated corpus as training sets for a variant of BBN's Identifinder in French, Ukrainian, Spanish, Polish, Russian, and Portuguese, achieving overall F-scores as high as 84.7% on independent, human-annotated corpora, comparable to a system trained on up to 40,000 words of human-annotated newswire.",,WikiNEuRal: Combined Neural and Knowledge-based Silver Data Creation for Multilingual NER,"Multilingual Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key intermediate task which is needed in many areas of NLP. In this paper, we address the well-known issue of data scarcity in NER, especially relevant when moving to a multilingual scenario, and go beyond current approaches to the creation of multilingual silver data for the task. We exploit the texts of Wikipedia and introduce a new methodology based on the effective combination of knowledge-based approaches and neural models, together with a novel domain adaptation technique, to produce high-quality training corpora for NER. We evaluate our datasets extensively on standard benchmarks for NER, yielding substantial improvements of up to 6 span-based F1-score points over previous state-of-the-art systems for data creation.",10.18653/v1/2021.findings-emnlp.215,"In addressing the challenge of multilingual named entity recognition (NER), recent methodologies have leveraged the rich metadata and structure of Wikipedia to generate annotated datasets with minimal human intervention. One approach combines Wikipedia metadata with parallel English-foreign language sentences using a semi-CRF model, outperforming standard annotation projection methods and metadata-only approaches (1). Another method evaluates the effectiveness of Wikipedia's link structure for automatic near gold-standard annotations, demonstrating that models trained on Wikipedia data can surpass those trained on newswire corpora (2). The WEXEA system extends this by exhaustively annotating Wikipedia text, linking all entity mentions to corresponding articles, thus providing a more comprehensive corpus for NER and other NLP tasks (3). Additionally, the multilingual nature of Wikipedia has been exploited to annotate text in less commonly taught languages, using the Category structure to determine named entity types and bootstrapping the NER process in various languages with high F-scores achieved on independent corpora (4). Lastly, WikiNEuRal introduces a novel methodology that synergizes knowledge-based and neural models with domain adaptation techniques to create high-quality multilingual silver data, resulting in significant improvements over previous systems (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the potential of leveraging Wikipedia's multilingual resources and advanced modeling techniques to enhance NER systems' performance across diverse languages.","{

1152,First/Second Language Acquisition,Linguistics,Effects of the violation of joint attention on mapping processes,Learning words in nonostensive contexts.,"Four word learning studies with 24-month-old children are reported. In Studies 1 and 2, an adult used a novel word to announce her intention to perform an action or to find an object. It was found that a knowledge of what action or object was impending ― established through scripted events before the word's introduction ― was not necessary for children to learn the words. Studies 3 and 4 focused on what word learning cues children might be using in these contexts. In Study 3, it was found that children learned a novel verb for an intentional and not an accidental action. In Study 4, it was found that children learned a novel noun for an object the adult was searching for, not ones she had rejected while searching",10.1037/0012-1649.30.5.639,Two-year-olds learn words for absent objects and actions,"Two studies of word learning in 24-month-old children are reported, one involving an object word (Study 1) and one involving an action word (Study 2). In both studies, non-verbal scripts of playing with novel objects/actions in particular ways were established before the child was exposed to any language models. Following this pre-training, children heard an experimenter announce her intention to either find an object or perform an action. In the referent condition, children then saw the intended referent (object or action) immediately after hearing the language model. Children in the absent referent condition experienced the same non-verbal scripts and language models, but never saw the referent object or action after hearing the language model: at the appropriate juncture in the script they were told that the toy barn in which the target object had been previously located was “locked”, or that the toy character who had previously performed the target action was missing. Comparisons with two control conditions indicated that children were able to learn words for a novel object and a novel action in both the referent and absent referent conditions and, moreover, that learning was equivalent in these two conditions. These results show quite clearly that early lexical acquisition does not depend on temporal contiguity between word and referent—or indeed any perceptual pairing between word and referent at all—but rather it relies on children's active understandings of a speaker's referential intentions in particular discourse contexts.",10.1111/j.2044-835x.1996.tb00695.x,Phonotactic Constraints on Infant Word Learning: PHONOTACTIC CONSTRAINTS ON INFANT WORD LEARNING,"How do infants use their knowledge of native language sound patterns when learning words? There is ample evidence of infants' precocious acquisition of native language sound structure during the first years of life, but much less evidence concerning how they apply this knowledge to the task of associating sounds with meanings in word learning. To address this question, 18-month-olds were presented with two phonotactically legal object labels (containing sound sequences that occur frequently in English) or two phonotactically illegal object labels (containing sound sequences that never occur in English), paired with novel objects. Infants were then tested using a looking-while-listening measure. The results revealed that infants looked at the correct objects after hearing the legal labels, but not the illegal labels. Furthermore, vocabulary size was related to performance. Infants with larger receptive vocabularies displayed greater differences between learning of legal and illegal labels than infants with smaller vocabularies. These findings provide evidence that infants' knowledge of native language sound patterns influences their word learning.",10.1111/j.1532-7078.2010.00046.x,The Interplay of Cross-Situational Word Learning and Sentence-Level Constraints,"A variety of mechanisms contribute to word learning. Learners can track co-occurring words and referents across situations in a bottom-up manner (cross-situational word learning, CSWL). Equally, they can exploit sentential contexts, relying on top-down information such as verb-argument relations and world knowledge, offering immediate constraints on meaning (word learning based on sentence-level constraints, SLCL). When combined, CSWL and SLCL potentially modulate each other's influence, revealing how word learners deal with multiple mechanisms simultaneously: Do they use all mechanisms? Prefer one? Is their strategy context dependent? Three experiments conducted with adult learners reveal that learners prioritize SLCL over CSWL. CSWL is applied in addition to SLCL only if SLCL is not perfectly disambiguating, thereby complementing or competing with it. These studies demonstrate the importance of investigating word-learning mechanisms simultaneously, revealing important characteristics of their interaction in more naturalistic learning environments.",10.1111/cogs.12178,Infants' ability to consult the speaker for clues to word reference,"ABSTRACTThis research examines whether infants actively seek information from a speaker regarding the referent of the speaker's utterance. Forty-eight infants (in three age groups: 1;2–1;3, 1;4–1;5, and 1;6–1;7) heard novel labels for novel objects in two situations: follow-in labelling (the experimenter looked at and labelled the toy of the infant's focus) vs. discrepant labelling (the experimenter looked at and labelled a different toy than that of the infant's focus). Subsequently, half of the infants were asked comprehension questions (e.g. ‘Where's the peri?’). The other half were asked preference questions (e.g. ‘Where's the one you like?’), to ensure that their comprehension performance was not merely the result of preferential responding. The comprehension results revealed developmental change in both (a) infants' ability to establish new word-object mappings (infants aged 1;2–1;3 failed to establish stable word-object links even in follow-in labelling), and (b) infants' ability to pinpoint the correct referent during discrepant labelling (only infants aged 1;6–1;7 succeeded). Thus the period between 1;2 and 1;7 represents a time of change in infants' ability to establish new word-object mappings: infants are becoming increasingly adept at acquiring new labels under minimal learning conditions.",10.1017/s0305000900008345,"In exploring the effects of the violation of joint attention on mapping processes, various methodologies have been employed to understand how children learn words in contexts where joint attention is disrupted. Studies 1 and 2 utilized scripted events to establish a context before introducing novel words, finding that children could learn words without a clear knowledge of the impending action or object (1). Similarly, Studies 1 and 2 in another paper used non-verbal scripts followed by language models to teach words for objects and actions that were either present or absent, demonstrating that children's word learning does not rely on temporal contiguity between word and referent (2). In contrast, a study focusing on phonotactic constraints presented infants with legal and illegal sound sequences, using a looking-while-listening measure to assess word learning, revealing that infants' knowledge of sound patterns and vocabulary size influenced their ability to learn words (3). Another approach examined the interplay between cross-situational word learning and sentence-level constraints, using experiments with adult learners to show a preference for sentence-level constraints when both mechanisms were available (4). Lastly, research on infants' ability to seek information from a speaker involved follow-in and discrepant labelling, with comprehension questions to test the establishment of word-object mappings, indicating a developmental progression in infants' word learning abilities (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the complexity of word learning and the various cues and contexts that children utilize when joint attention is compromised.","{

}","The research on the effects of the violation of joint attention on mapping processes reveals that children's word learning is robust and can occur even in nonostensive contexts, without the need for temporal contiguity between word and referent (1, 2). Studies demonstrate that 24-month-old children can learn words for both present and absent objects and actions, suggesting that they rely on their understanding of a speaker's referential intentions rather than on direct perceptual pairing (2). This ability to infer meaning is further influenced by infants' knowledge of native language sound patterns, as they are more adept at associating sounds with meanings when the sounds conform to phonotactic rules of their language (3). However, when multiple word-learning mechanisms are available, such as cross-situational word learning and sentence-level constraints, learners tend to prioritize the latter, indicating a preference for top-down contextual information over bottom-up associative learning (4). The developmental trajectory of these skills is also highlighted, with infants showing increased proficiency in establishing word-object mappings and resolving referential ambiguity as they age, particularly when they actively seek clues from the speaker to identify the correct referent (5). Collectively, these findings underscore the complexity and adaptability of the word-learning process, as children navigate and compensate for potential disruptions in joint attention scenarios.","{

}","In exploring the effects of the violation of joint attention on mapping processes, a series of studies provide insights into how children learn words and map them to their referents. The first paper demonstrates that 24-month-old children can learn words in nonostensive contexts, acquiring novel verbs and nouns without the need for a clear, scripted event or the presence of the referent object or action, suggesting that children use cues beyond joint attention to learn words (1). Similarly, the second study shows that two-year-olds can learn words for objects and actions that are not immediately present, relying on their understanding of a speaker's referential intentions rather than temporal or perceptual pairing, indicating that joint attention violations do not necessarily impede word learning (2). The third paper highlights that infants' word learning is influenced by their knowledge of native language sound patterns, with phonotactic legality facilitating the mapping of sounds to objects, which suggests that phonological cues can compensate when joint attention is compromised (3). The fourth study reveals that adult learners prioritize sentence-level constraints over cross-situational word learning, indicating that when joint attention is violated, learners may rely more on linguistic context than on tracking co-occurrences (4). Lastly, the fifth paper indicates a developmental progression in infants' ability to seek information from a speaker and establish word-object mappings, with older infants better able to handle discrepant labelling situations, suggesting that the ability to overcome joint attention violations improves with age (5). Together, these studies suggest that while joint attention facilitates word learning, children and infants possess alternative strategies to map words to their referents when joint attention is not maintained.","{

}","In a series of studies, researchers explored the effects of joint attention violation on mapping processes during early word learning (1, 2). Studies 1 and 2 from paper 1 demonstrated that children could learn novel words in non-ostensive contexts without requiring temporal contiguity or perceptual pairing between word and referent (1). Meanwhile, studies in paper 2 showed that children were able to learn words for absent objects and actions based on the speaker's referential intentions (2).

Paper 3 provided evidence that infants' knowledge of native language sound patterns influences their word learning through phonotactic constraints (3). Infants displayed greater differences in learning legal versus illegal labels, with larger vocabularies leading to better performance.

Study findings from paper 4 revealed that learners prioritize sentence-level constraints over cross-situational word learning but apply the latter when necessary for disambiguation (4). These studies emphasized the importance of investigating multiple mechanisms in naturalistic learning environments.

Lastly, research in paper 5 examined infants' ability to consult a speaker for clues regarding referents and revealed developmental changes in their ability to establish new word-object mappings between 1;2 and 1;7 (5). Infants aged 1;2–1;3 struggled with establishing stable word-object links, while those aged 1;6–1;7 successfully identified the correct referent during discrepant labeling.

In summary, these studies collectively demonstrate that children's early word learning is not dependent on temporal contiguity or perceptual pairing between words and referents (1, 2). Instead, they rely on their understanding of a speaker's intentions in specific contexts and their knowledge of native language sound patterns to learn new words (1-3).","{

In this context, it is crucial to enforce access control policies that satisfy data protection and privacy requirements of partner organisations. However, due to the distributed nature of cloud federations, the access control system alone does not guarantee that its deployed components cannot be circumvented while processing access requests. In order to promote accountability and reliability of a distributed access control system, we present a decentralised runtime monitoring architecture based on blockchain technology.",,FairAccess: a new Blockchain-based access control framework for the Internet of Things,"Security and privacy are huge challenges in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, but unfortunately, the harmonization of the IoT-related standards and protocols is hardly and slowly widespread. In this paper, we propose a new framework for access control in IoT based on the blockchain technology. Our first contribution consists in providing a reference model for our proposed framework within the Objectives, Models, Architecture and Mechanism specification in IoT. In addition, we introduce FairAccess as a fully decentralized pseudonymous and privacy preserving authorization management framework that enables users to own and control their data. To implement our model, we use and adapt the blockchain into a decentralized access control manager. Unlike financial bitcoin transactions, FairAccess introduces new types of transactions that are used to grant, get, delegate, and revoke access. As a proof of concept, we establish an initial implementation with a Raspberry PI device and local blockchain. Finally, we discuss some limitations and propose further opportunities.

Blockchain-based data provenance can provide tamper-proof records, enable the transparency of data accountability in the cloud, and help to enhance the privacy and availability of the provenance data. We make use of the cloud storage scenario and choose the cloud file as a data unit to detect user operations for collecting provenance data. We design and implement ProvChain, an architecture to collect and verify cloud data provenance, by embedding the provenance data into blockchain transactions. ProvChain operates mainly in three phases: (1) provenance data collection, (2) provenance data storage, and (3) provenance data validation. Results from performance evaluation demonstrate that ProvChain provides security features including tamper-proof provenance, user privacy and reliability with low overhead for the cloud storage applications.",,Enigma: Decentralized computation platform with guaranteed privacy,"A peer-to-peer network, enabling different parties to jointly store and run computations on data while keeping the data completely private.

An external blockchain is utilized as the controller of the network, manages access control, identities and serves as a tamper-proof log of events. Security deposits and fees incentivize operation, correctness and fairness of the system. Similar to Bitcoin, Enigma removes the need for a trusted third party, enabling autonomous control of personal data. For the first time, users are able to share their data with cryptographic guarantees regarding their privacy.",,BBDS: Blockchain-based data sharing for electronic medical records in cloud environments,"Disseminating medical data beyond the protected cloud of institutions poses severe risks to patients’ privacy, as breaches push them to the point where they abstain from full disclosure of their condition. This situation negatively impacts the patient, scientific research, and all stakeholders. To address this challenge, we propose a blockchain-based data sharing framework that sufficiently addresses the access control challenges associated with sensitive data stored in the cloud using immutability and built-in autonomy properties of the blockchain. Our system is based on a permissioned blockchain which allows access to only invited, and hence verified users. As a result of this design, further accountability is guaranteed as all users are already known and a log of their actions is kept by the blockchain. The system permits users to request data from the shared pool after their identities and cryptographic keys are verified. The evidence from the system evaluation shows that our scheme is lightweight, scalable, and efficient.",,"In addressing the challenge of secure access management across various domains, such as cloud federations, IoT environments, cloud data provenance, decentralized computation, and electronic medical records, recent research has converged on the application of blockchain technology to enhance security, privacy, and reliability. The decentralized runtime monitoring architecture proposed in (1) leverages blockchain to ensure accountability in cloud federations, while (2) introduces FairAccess, a blockchain-based framework for IoT that employs novel transaction types for access control and is demonstrated using a Raspberry PI device.

The structural properties of the products were investigated by using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution TEM techniques. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy technique was employed to investigate the mechanism of NO2 sensing. Free nitrate ions, nitrate ions, and nitrite anions were the main adsorbed species. N2O was formed via NO– and N2O2– that were stemmed from NO. Comparative tests for gas sensing between gas sensors based on the as-prepared porous ZnO nanoflakes and purchased ZnO nanoparticles clearly showed that the former exhibited more excellent NO2 sensing performances. Photoluminescence and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra further proved that the intensities of donors (oxygen vacancy (VO) and/or zinc interstitial (Zni)) and surface oxygen species (O2– and O2), which were involved in the mechani...",10.1021/jp201816d,Black Phosphorus Gas Sensors,"The utilization of black phosphorus and its monolayer (phosphorene) and few-layers in field-effect transistors has attracted a lot of attention to this elemental two-dimensional material. Various studies on optimization of black phosphorus field-effect transistors, PN junctions, photodetectors, and other applications have been demonstrated. Although chemical sensing based on black phosphorus devices was theoretically predicted, there is still no experimental verification of such an important study of this material. In this article, we report on chemical sensing of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) using field-effect transistors based on multilayer black phosphorus. Black phosphorus sensors exhibited increased conduction upon NO2 exposure and excellent sensitivity for detection of NO2 down to 5 ppb. Moreover, when the multilayer black phosphorus field-effect transistor was exposed to NO2 concentrations of 5, 10, 20, and 40 ppb, its relative conduction change followed the Langmuir isotherm for molecules adsorbed on a surface. Additionally, on the basis of an exponential conductance change, the rate constants for adsorption and desorption of NO2 on black phosphorus were extracted for different NO2 concentrations, and they were in the range of 130-840 s. These results shed light on important electronic and sensing characteristics of black phosphorus, which can be utilized in future studies and applications.",10.1021/acsnano.5b01961,Graphene Nanomesh As Highly Sensitive Chemiresistor Gas Sensor,"Graphene is a one atom thick carbon allotrope with all surface atoms that has attracted significant attention as a promising material as the conduction channel of a field-effect transistor and chemical field-effect transistor sensors. However, the zero bandgap of semimetal graphene still limits its application for these devices. In this work, ethanol-chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of a grown p-type semiconducting large-area monolayer graphene film was patterned into a nanomesh by the combination of nanosphere lithography and reactive ion etching and evaluated as a field-effect transistor and chemiresistor gas sensors. The resulting neck-width of the synthesized nanomesh was about ∼20 nm and was comprised of the gap between polystyrene (PS) spheres that was formed during the reactive ion etching (RIE) process. The neck-width and the periodicities of the graphene nanomesh (GNM) could be easily controlled depending on the duration/power of the RIE and the size of the PS nanospheres. The fabricated GNM transistor device exhibited promising electronic properties featuring a high drive current and an I(ON)/I(OFF) ratio of about 6, significantly higher than its film counterpart. Similarly, when applied as a chemiresistor gas sensor at room temperature, the graphene nanomesh sensor showed excellent sensitivity toward NO(2) and NH(3), significantly higher than their film counterparts. The ethanol-based graphene nanomesh sensors exhibited sensitivities of about 4.32%/ppm in NO(2) and 0.71%/ppm in NH(3) with limits of detection of 15 and 160 ppb, respectively. Our demonstrated studies on controlling the neck width of the nanomesh would lead to further improvement of graphene-based transistors and sensors.",10.1021/ac3012895,Physisorption-Based Charge Transfer in Two-Dimensional SnS2 for Selective and Reversible NO2 Gas Sensing,"Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a gas species that plays an important role in certain industrial, farming, and healthcare sectors. However, there are still significant challenges for NO2 sensing at low detection limits, especially in the presence of other interfering gases. The NO2 selectivity of current gas-sensing technologies is significantly traded-off with their sensitivity and reversibility as well as fabrication and operating costs. In this work, we present an important progress for selective and reversible NO2 sensing by demonstrating an economical sensing platform based on the charge transfer between physisorbed NO2 gas molecules and two-dimensional (2D) tin disulfide (SnS2) flakes at low operating temperatures. The device shows high sensitivity and superior selectivity to NO2 at operating temperatures of less than 160 °C, which are well below those of chemisorptive and ion conductive NO2 sensors with much poorer selectivity. At the same time, excellent reversibility of the sensor is demonstrated, which has rarely been observed in other 2D material counterparts. Such impressive features originate from the planar morphology of 2D SnS2 as well as unique physical affinity and favorable electronic band positions of this material that facilitate the NO2 physisorption and charge transfer at parts per billion levels. The 2D SnS2-based sensor provides a real solution for low-cost and selective NO2 gas sensing.",10.1021/acsnano.5b04343,Sensing Behavior of Atomically Thin-Layered MoS2 Transistors,"Most of recent research on layered chalcogenides is understandably focused on single atomic layers. However, it is unclear if single-layer units are the most ideal structures for enhanced gas-solid interactions. To probe this issue further, we have prepared large-area MoS2 sheets ranging from single to multiple layers on 300 nm SiO2/Si substrates using the micromechanical exfoliation method. The thickness and layering of the sheets were identified by optical microscope, invoking recently reported specific optical color contrast, and further confirmed by AFM and Raman spectroscopy. The MoS2 transistors with different thicknesses were assessed for gas-sensing performances with exposure to NO2, NH3, and humidity in different conditions such as gate bias and light irradiation. The results show that, compared to the single-layer counterpart, transistors of few MoS2 layers exhibit excellent sensitivity, recovery, and ability to be manipulated by gate bias and green light. Further, our ab initio DFT calculations on single-layer and bilayer MoS2 show that the charge transfer is the reason for the decrease in resistance in the presence of applied field.",10.1021/nn400026u,"In the realm of chemical sensors, recent methodologies have focused on the synthesis and application of various nanomaterials to enhance sensitivity and selectivity for gas detection. Porous ZnO polygonal nanoflakes were synthesized using a microwave hydrothermal method and their gas sensing properties were investigated through a suite of techniques including X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, with the sensing mechanism probed by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (1). Similarly, black phosphorus field-effect transistors were utilized for NO2 detection, with their sensing behavior following the Langmuir isotherm and the adsorption/desorption rate constants determined through conductance changes (2).

Two-dimensional materials such as SnS2 and MoS2 have shown promise in this area due to their unique physical affinity and favorable electronic properties that facilitate physisorption and charge transfer at parts per billion levels.

In one study, a selective and reversible NO2 sensor was demonstrated using 2D SnS2 flakes for physisorption-based charge transfer at low operating temperatures. The device exhibited high sensitivity and superior selectivity to NO2, with excellent reversibility, making it a promising solution for low-cost and selective NO2 gas sensing.

Another study explored the ideal structures for enhanced gas-solid interactions by preparing large-area MoS2 sheets ranging from single to multiple layers on SiO2/Si substrates. The results showed that transistors of few MoS2 layers exhibit excellent sensitivity, recovery, and ability to be manipulated by gate bias and green light compared to their single-layer counterpart. Ab initio DFT calculations further confirmed the charge transfer as the reason for the decrease in resistance in the presence of an applied field.

Additionally, graphene nanomesh sensors have shown excellent sensitivity toward NO2 and NH3 at room temperature, significantly higher than their film counterparts. The neck-width and periodicities of the graphene nanomesh could be easily controlled, leading to further improvement of graphene-based transistors and sensors.

Outcomes of Depression International Network (ODIN) Group,"Abstract Objectives: To determine the acceptability of two psychological interventions for depressed adults in the community and their effect on caseness, symptoms, and subjective function. Design: A pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial, stratified by centre. Setting: Nine urban and rural communities in Finland, Republic of Ireland, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Participants: 452 participants aged 18 to 65, identified through a community survey with depressive or adjustment disorders according to the international classification of diseases, 10th revision or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition. Interventions: Six individual sessions of problem solving treatment (n=128), eight group sessions of the course on prevention of depression (n=108), and controls (n=189). Main outcome measures: Completion rates for each intervention, diagnosis of depression, and depressive symptoms and subjective function. Results: 63% of participants assigned to problem solving and 44% assigned to prevention of depression completed their intervention. The proportion of problem solving participants depressed at six months was 17% less than that for controls, giving a number needed to treat of 6; the mean difference in Beck depression inventory score was −2.63 (95% confidence interval −4.95 to −0.32), and there were significant improvements in SF-36 scores. For depression prevention, the difference in proportions of depressed participants was 14% (number needed to treat of 7); the mean difference in Beck depression inventory score was −1.50 (−4.16 to 1.17), and there were significant improvements in SF-36 scores. Such differences were not observed at 12 months. Neither specific diagnosis nor treatment with antidepressants affected outcome. Conclusions: When offered to adults with depressive disorders in the community, problem solving treatment was more acceptable than the course on prevention of depression.

Design: Randomised controlled trial of problem solving treatment, amitriptyline plus standard clinical management, and drug placebo plus standard clinical management. Each treatment was delivered in six sessions over 12 weeks. Setting: Primary care in Oxfordshire. Subjects: 91 patients in primary care who had major depression. Main outcome measures: Observer and self reported measures of severity of depression, self reported measure of social outcome, and observer measure of psychological symptoms at six and 12 weeks; self reported measure of patient satisfaction at 12 weeks. Numbers of patients recovered at six and 12 weeks. Results: At six and 12 weeks the difference in score on the Hamilton rating scale for depression between problem solving and placebo treatments was significant (5.3 (95% confidence interval 1.6 to 9.0) and 4.7 (0.4 to 9.0) respectively), but the difference between problem solving and amitriptyline was not significant (1.8 (−1.8 to 5.5) and 0.9 (−3.3 to 5.2) respectively). At 12 weeks 60% (18/30) of patients given problem solving treatment had recovered on the Hamilton scale compared with 52% (16/31) given amitriptyline and 27% (8/30) given placebo. Patients were satisfied with problem solving treatment; all patients who completed treatment (28/30) rated the treatment as helpful or very helpful.

Usual primary care; usual care plus a telephone care management program including at least 3 outreach calls, feedback to the treating physician, and care coordination; usual care plus care management integrated with a structured 8-session cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy program delivered by telephone.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Blinded telephone interviews at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months assessed depression severity (Hopkins Symptom Checklist Depression Scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire), patient-rated improvement, and satisfaction with treatment. Computerized administrative data examined use of antidepressant medication and outpatient visits.


RESULTS
Treatment participation rates were 97% for telephone care management and 93% for telephone care management plus psychotherapy. Compared with usual care, the telephone psychotherapy intervention led to lower mean Hopkins Symptom Checklist Depression Scale depression scores (P =.02), a higher proportion of patients reporting that depression was ""much improved"" (80% vs 55%, P<.001), and a higher proportion of patients ""very satisfied"" with depression treatment (59% vs 29%, P<.001). The telephone care management program had smaller effects on patient-rated improvement (66% vs 55%, P =.04) and satisfaction (47% vs 29%, P =.001); effects on mean depression scores were not statistically significant.


CONCLUSIONS
For primary care patients beginning antidepressant treatment, a telephone program integrating care management and structured cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy can significantly improve satisfaction and clinical outcomes. These findings suggest a new public health model of psychotherapy for depression including active outreach and vigorous efforts to improve access to and motivation for treatment.",10.1001/jama.292.8.935,Telephone-based treatment for family practice patients with mild depression,"The need for treating milder forms of depression has recently been of increased interest. This was a randomized, controlled study to evaluate the effects of telephone-based problem-solving therapy for mild depression. Comparison groups were a treatment-as-usual group and another group receiving stress-management training by telephone. From 1,742 family practice patients screened for depression, 54 with mild depression entered the study. Treatment was provided by experienced family practice nurses, trained and supervised in the treatments. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was administered before and after the intervention period, and the Beck Depression Inventory and Duke Health Profile were administered at the end of the intervention period. Of the 36 subjects assigned to the problem-solving and stress-management groups, half dropped out early in the study. Five from the treatment-as-usual group were lost to follow-up. In the remaining subjects, there was a significant decrease in depression scores. There were no significant differences in the amount of decrease between the groups on any scores. The small sample and high dropout rate limit the interpretation of the findings. However, since all subjects tended to improve, regardless of treatment received, mild levels of depression may generally remit even without focal intervention, and watchful waiting may be a reasonable alternative for management.",10.2466/pr0.94.3.785-792,Acute and one-year outcome of a randomised controlled trial of brief cognitive therapy for major depressive disorder in primary care,"BackgroundThe consensus statement on the treatment of depression (Paykel & Priest, 1992) advocates the use of cognitive therapy techniques as an adjunct to medication.MethodThis paper describes a randomised controlled trial of brief cognitive therapy (BCT) plus ‘treatment as usual’ versus treatment as usual in the management of 48 patients with major depressive disorder presenting in primary care.ResultsAt the end of the acute phase, significantly more subjects (P < 0.05) met recovery criteria in the intervention group (n=15) compared with the control group (n=8). When initial neuroticism scores were controlled for, reductions in Beck Depression Inventory and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores favoured the BCT group throughout the 12 months of follow-up.ConclusionsBCT may be beneficial, but given the time constraints, therapists need to be more rather than less skilled in cognitive therapy. This, plus methodological limitations, leads us to advise caution before applying this approach more widely in primary care.",10.1192/bjp.171.2.131,"The methodologies employed across the five studies investigating psychotherapy for depression reveal a shared emphasis on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effectiveness of various psychological interventions, with a particular focus on problem-solving treatment and cognitive therapy. The ODIN Group study (1) utilized a multicenter RCT design to compare problem-solving treatment and group psychoeducation against a control group, assessing outcomes such as depression caseness and subjective function. Similarly, a primary care-based RCT compared problem-solving treatment with amitriptyline and placebo, emphasizing feasibility and patient satisfaction (2). The use of telephone interventions was explored in two studies, one examining the integration of telephone care management with cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy (3), and another assessing telephone-based problem-solving therapy against stress-management training and treatment-as-usual for mild depression (4). These studies underscore the potential of remote interventions to increase accessibility and patient engagement. Lastly, a trial of brief cognitive therapy plus standard treatment versus standard treatment alone highlighted the importance of therapist skill and the potential for long-term benefits (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of RCTs in establishing the efficacy of psychotherapeutic interventions, the potential of integrating psychotherapy with primary care and remote delivery methods, and the need for skilled therapists to maximize treatment outcomes (1-5).","{

}","Recent studies have explored various psychotherapeutic approaches for treating depression, revealing a pattern of effectiveness and patient acceptability for different interventions. Problem-solving treatment (PST) has been identified as a particularly promising method, demonstrating significant improvements in depressive symptoms and subjective function when compared to control groups and even rivaling the efficacy of antidepressant medication (1, 2). Notably, PST has been found to be more acceptable to patients than group psychoeducation and has shown to be feasible and effective in primary care settings (1, 2). The integration of PST with telephone care management has further enhanced patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes, suggesting that remote delivery of psychotherapy can be a valuable component of a public health model for treating depression (3). However, the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic interventions may vary with the severity of depression; for instance, telephone-based interventions for mild depression did not show significant differences compared to treatment as usual, indicating that mild depression may remit without targeted intervention (4). Additionally, brief cognitive therapy (BCT) has been shown to be beneficial in primary care, particularly when delivered by skilled therapists, although its long-term effectiveness warrants cautious interpretation due to methodological limitations (5). Collectively, these findings underscore the potential of PST and BCT as viable psychotherapeutic options for depression, with the mode of delivery and therapist expertise being key factors in their success (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).","{

1293,Artificial Intelligence,Computer Sciences,transformer model,Multilingual Denoising Pre-training for Neural Machine Translation,"This paper demonstrates that multilingual denoising pre-training produces significant performance gains across a wide variety of machine translation (MT) tasks. We present mBART—a sequence-to-sequence denoising auto-encoder pre-trained on large-scale monolingual corpora in many languages using the BART objective (Lewis et al., 2019 ). mBART is the first method for pre-training a complete sequence-to-sequence model by denoising full texts in multiple languages, whereas previous approaches have focused only on the encoder, decoder, or reconstructing parts of the text. Pre-training a complete model allows it to be directly fine-tuned for supervised (both sentence-level and document-level) and unsupervised machine translation, with no task- specific modifications. We demonstrate that adding mBART initialization produces performance gains in all but the highest-resource settings, including up to 12 BLEU points for low resource MT and over 5 BLEU points for many document-level and unsupervised models. We also show that it enables transfer to language pairs with no bi-text or that were not in the pre-training corpus, and present extensive analysis of which factors contribute the most to effective pre-training. 1",10.1162/tacl_a_00343,Big Bird: Transformers for Longer Sequences,"Transformers-based models, such as BERT, have been one of the most successful deep learning models for NLP. Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having $O(1)$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also propose novel applications to genomics data.",,"BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension","We present BART, a denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence models. BART is trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture which, despite its simplicity, can be seen as generalizing BERT (due to the bidirectional encoder), GPT (with the left-to-right decoder), and other recent pretraining schemes. We evaluate a number of noising approaches, finding the best performance by both randomly shuffling the order of sentences and using a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token. BART is particularly effective when fine tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa on GLUE and SQuAD, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 3.5 ROUGE. BART also provides a 1.1 BLEU increase over a back-translation system for machine translation, with only target language pretraining. We also replicate other pretraining schemes within the BART framework, to understand their effect on end-task performance.",10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.703,GLIDE: Towards Photorealistic Image Generation and Editing with Text-Guided Diffusion Models,"Diffusion models have recently been shown to generate high-quality synthetic images, especially when paired with a guidance technique to trade off diversity for fidelity. We explore diffusion models for the problem of text-conditional image synthesis and compare two different guidance strategies: CLIP guidance and classifier-free guidance. We find that the latter is preferred by human evaluators for both photorealism and caption similarity, and often produces photorealistic samples. Samples from a 3.5 billion parameter text-conditional diffusion model using classifier-free guidance are favored by human evaluators to those from DALL-E, even when the latter uses expensive CLIP reranking. Additionally, we find that our models can be fine-tuned to perform image inpainting, enabling powerful text-driven image editing. We train a smaller model on a filtered dataset and release the code and weights at https://github.com/openai/glide-text2im.",10.48550/arXiv.2112.10741,Switch Transformers: Scaling to Trillion Parameter Models with Simple and Efficient Sparsity,"In deep learning, models typically reuse the same parameters for all inputs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models defy this and instead select diﬀerent parameters for each incoming example. The result is a sparsely-activated model—with an outrageous number of parameters—but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs, and training instability. We address these with the introduction of the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques mitigate the instabilities, and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the ﬁrst time, with lower precision (bﬂoat16) formats. We design models based oﬀ T5-Base and T5-Large (Raﬀel et al., 2019) to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the “Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus”, and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model. 1 present in each. These benchmarks consist of tasks requiring sentiment analysis (SST-2), word sense disambiguation (WIC), sentence similarty (MRPC, STS-B, QQP), natural language inference (MNLI, QNLI, RTE, CB), question answering (MultiRC, RECORD, BoolQ), coreference resolution (WNLI, WSC) and sentence completion (COPA) and sentence acceptability (CoLA). The CNNDM (Hermann et al., 2015) and BBC XSum (Narayan et al., 2018) data sets are used to measure the ability to summarize articles. Question answering is probed with the SQuAD data set (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) and the ARC Reasoning Challenge (Clark et al., 2018). And as in Roberts et al. (2020), we evaluate the knowledge of our models by ﬁne-tuning on three closed-book question answering data sets: Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), Web Questions (Berant et al., 2013) and Trivia QA (Joshi et al., 2017). Closed-book refers to questions posed with no supplemental reference or context material. To gauge the model’s common sense reasoning we evaluate it on the Winogrande Schema Challenge (Sakaguchi et al., 2020). And ﬁnally, we test our model’s natural language inference capabilities on the Adversarial NLI Benchmark (Nie et al., 2019). embeddings based on the incoming token representations to a given layer. Our work studies a speciﬁc model in a class of methods that do conditional computation, where computation decisions are made dynamically based on the input. Cho and Bengio (2014) proposed adaptively selecting weights based on certain bit patterns occuring in the model hidden-states. Eigen et al. (2013) built stacked expert layers with dense matrix multiplications and ReLU activations and showed promising results on jittered MNIST and monotone speech. In computer vision Puigcerver et al. (2020) manually route tokens based on semantic classes during upstream pre-training and then select the relevant experts to be used according to the downstream task.",,"In addressing the research problem of transformer models, the methodologies employed across the five papers demonstrate a range of innovative approaches to enhance performance and scalability. The mBART model introduced in (1) leverages multilingual denoising pre-training on a sequence-to-sequence autoencoder, pre-trained on large-scale monolingual corpora, which is a departure from previous methods that focused on individual components of the model. This comprehensive pre-training allows for direct fine-tuning across various machine translation tasks without task-specific modifications. BigBird (2) addresses the limitation of quadratic dependency on sequence length inherent in transformer models by introducing a sparse attention mechanism, which reduces this dependency to linear, enabling the processing of longer sequences and improving performance on tasks like question answering and summarization. BART (3) employs a denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence models, using a combination of sentence shuffling and an in-filling scheme, which generalizes the capabilities of both BERT and GPT models and shows effectiveness in text generation and comprehension tasks. GLIDE (4) explores diffusion models for text-conditional image synthesis, comparing guidance strategies and demonstrating the effectiveness of classifier-free guidance for photorealism and caption similarity. Lastly, the Switch Transformer (5) introduces a simplified Mixture of Experts (MoE) routing algorithm, reducing communication and computational costs, and enabling the training of sparsely-activated models with a vast number of parameters while maintaining constant computational cost. Collectively, these methodologies contribute to the advancement of transformer models by enhancing their pre-training strategies, attention mechanisms, and scalability to accommodate the growing complexity of tasks in natural language processing and beyond (1-5).","{

}","Recent advancements in transformer models have significantly enhanced the capabilities of natural language processing tasks, with a focus on pre-training strategies, attention mechanisms, and model scaling. The introduction of mBART, a multilingual denoising pre-training method, has shown substantial improvements in machine translation by pre-training a complete sequence-to-sequence model, which can be fine-tuned for various supervised and unsupervised tasks, demonstrating gains in low-resource settings and transferability to language pairs not included in the pre-training corpus (1). Meanwhile, BigBird addresses the limitation of quadratic dependency on sequence length inherent in traditional transformers by introducing a sparse attention mechanism, enabling the processing of longer sequences and improving performance on tasks like question answering and summarization (2).
