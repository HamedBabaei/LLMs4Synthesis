Visible spectrum of highly charged ions: The forbidden optical lines of Kr, Xe, and Ba ions in  the Ar I to Kr I isoelectronic sequence\nWe present experimental data on visible transitions in highly charged ions observed in the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) electron beam ion traps, including results from lines within the ground-state configuration and the first excited configuration. Measurements of lines produced by Kr (q = 11+ to 22+), Xe (q = 18+ to 35+), and Ba (q = 28+ to 36+) ions, corresponding mainly to 3sl 3pm 3dn configurations, were carried out. The ionization stages were determined experimentally by sweeping the electron beam energy over the ionization threshold of each species. We propose possible identifications for the lines with the help of simple atomic structure calculations. However, most observed lines remained unidentified, demonstrating that the understanding of visible spectra from highly charged ions, even if obtained under nearly \"ideal\" experimental conditions, is still in its infancy. These spectral data may be useful for the diagnostics of magnetically confined plasmas and may set the stage for future measurements of radiative lifetimes. In our experiments, we used the emission from visible lines to image the intersection of the electron beam with a beam of neutral atoms injected into the trap at a right angle as well as the ion cloud in the trap. Under some conditions, the diameter of the ion cloud may be an order of magnitude larger than that of the electron beam.  PACS Nos.: 32.30Jc, 39.30+w, 52.59Rz\n\n2. Lifetime measurements in the ground configuration of and using an electron beam ion trap\nWe have measured the radiative lifetimes for the level of and the level of .

Our lifetime results, 8.7(5) ms for and 5.7(5) ms for , are compared with theory.\n\n3. UV light from the ground term of Ti-like ytterbium, tungsten, and bismuth\nWe have used an electron-beam ion trap to measure the wavelength of the J=2-3 magnetic dipole transition in the 3d{sup 4} ground term of Ti-like ytterbium, tungsten, and bismuth. This fills in a gap in previous measurements along this isoelectronic sequence, as well as extending previous work to the highest Z yet. With the addition of our results, measurements of this line now cover a sufficient range of Z to allow an interpolation of reliable wavelength estimates for the unmeasured members of the isoelectronic sequence from Z=52 to 83. We provide a table of these wavelengths for each member of the sequence in this range, and compare the measured wavelengths to recent calculations. Our results show that a long-standing discrepancy between prediction and experiment disappears in the high-Z limit. (c) 2000 The American Physical Society.\n\n4. The visible spectrum of highly charged ions: A window to fundamental physics\nThe observation of forbidden transitions in the visible range was the first experimental sign of the existence of highly charged ions in nature. Such lines can nowadays be excited in electron beam ion traps with excellent control of the ionic charge state, allowing their identification and precise determination of wavelengths and transition probabilities. The accuracy achieved in such experiments has been central to the study of nuclear size effects and quantum electrodynamic contributions, which are drastically magnified in highly charged ions, thus enabling the study of the underlying fundamental interactions in few-electron systems. At the same time, forbidden lines can be used to probe conditions in high temperature plasmas present in both astrophysical and laboratory environments.PACS Nos.: 31.30.Jv, 32.10.Fn, 32.30.Jc, 96.60.Tf, 97.10.Ex, 32.60.+i, 32.70.Cs, 12.20.Fv, 42.50.Xa\n\n5. First results from the Freiburg Electron Beam Ion Trap FreEBIT\nIn the first measurements at the Freiburg electron beam ion trap FreEBIT, highly charged ions of Xe, Ba, W, Kr and Ar have been observed (with charge states up to 63+) by means of X-ray spectroscopy. Experiments with an optical imaging spectrograph have been also carried out. Forbidden transitions in the visible range have been measured, from Kr22+ and Xe32+ stored in the trap.

        "inference": " In the exploration of UV Visible spectroscopy in highly charged ions (HCI), various methodologies have been employed to probe the forbidden optical lines and transitions within these ions. The use of electron beam ion traps (EBITs) is a common technique across studies, providing a controlled environment for the excitation and observation of HCIs. The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory EBIT was instrumental in identifying visible transitions in Kr, Xe, and Ba ions, with ionization stages determined by sweeping the electron beam energy (1). Similarly, the Freiburg EBIT, FreEBIT, was utilized to observe highly charged Xe, Ba, W, and Kr ions, with a notable optical imaging spectrograph that achieved a high resolution in the visible range (5). The measurement of radiative lifetimes was carried out in an EBIT, specifically the Lawrence Livermore EBIT, by monitoring the temporal behavior of radiative decays within the ground configuration of HCIs (2). Meanwhile, the wavelengths of magnetic dipole transitions in the ground term of Ti-like ions were measured in an EBIT, contributing to the resolution of discrepancies between predictions and experimental results for high-Z members of the isoelectronic sequence (3). These methodologies collectively enhance our understanding of HCI spectra and provide insights into fundamental physics and plasma diagnostics (4). The precision of these EBIT-based measurements has been crucial for understanding the complex interplay of quantum electrodynamic contributions and nuclear size effects in HCIs, thus advancing the field of HCI spectroscopy (1, 3, 4).",

Despite the high-quality conditions of the experiments, many observed lines remained unidentified, highlighting the nascent stage of understanding visible spectra from HCIs and their potential applications in plasma diagnostics (1). A separate experiment using an EBIT at the Freiburg Institute for Electronic Technology (FreEBIT) achieved precise measurements of forbidden transitions in the visible range for ions like Kr and Xe, with a notable optical resolution, thus contributing to the resolution of discrepancies between predictions and experimental results for HCIs (5). The third study extended the understanding of the UV light emitted from the ground term of Ti-like ions, filling a gap in previous measurements and resolving a longstanding discrepancy between predictions and experiments for high-Z ions (3). Additionally, the second paper focused on measuring the radiative lifetimes for specific levels of HCIs, using the EBIT to probe temporal changes in radiative decays, offering comparative data to theoretical predictions (2). Lastly, the fourth study emphasized the significance of forbidden transitions in the visible range, which have not only confirmed the existence of HCIs but also been instrumental in studying fundamental physics and conditions in high-temperature plasmas, both in astrophysical and laboratory settings (4). Together, these studies underscore the advancements in UV Visible spectroscopy in HCIs, with implications for both fundamental physics and applied plasma diagnostics.\n\n",

Visible spectrum of highly charged ions: The forbidden optical lines of Kr, Xe, and Ba ions in  the Ar I to Kr I isoelectronic sequence\nWe present experimental data on visible transitions in highly charged ions observed in the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) electron beam ion traps, including results from lines within the ground-state configuration and the first excited configuration. Measurements of lines produced by Kr (q = 11+ to 22+), Xe (q = 18+ to 35+), and Ba (q = 28+ to 36+) ions, corresponding mainly to 3sl 3pm 3dn configurations, were carried out. The ionization stages were determined experimentally by sweeping the electron beam energy over the ionization threshold of each species. We propose possible identifications for the lines with the help of simple atomic structure calculations. However, most observed lines remained unidentified, demonstrating that the understanding of visible spectra from highly charged ions, even if obtained under nearly \"ideal\" experimental conditions, is still in its infancy. These spectral data may be useful for the diagnostics of magnetically confined plasmas and may set the stage for future measurements of radiative lifetimes. In our experiments, we used the emission from visible lines to image the intersection of the electron beam with a beam of neutral atoms injected into the trap at a right angle as well as the ion cloud in the trap. Under some conditions, the diameter of the ion cloud may be an order of magnitude larger than that of the electron beam.  PACS Nos.: 32.30Jc, 39.30+w, 52.59Rz\n\n2. UV light from the ground term of Ti-like ytterbium, tungsten, and bismuth\nWe have used an electron-beam ion trap to measure the wavelength of the J=2-3 magnetic dipole transition in the 3d{sup 4} ground term of Ti-like ytterbium, tungsten, and bismuth. This fills in a gap in previous measurements along this isoelectronic sequence, as well as extending previous work to the highest Z yet. With the addition of our results, measurements of this line now cover a sufficient range of Z to allow an interpolation of reliable wavelength estimates for the unmeasured members of the isoelectronic sequence from Z=52 to 83. We provide a table of these wavelengths for each member of the sequence in this range, and compare the measured wavelengths to recent calculations. Our results show that a long-standing discrepancy between prediction and experiment disappears in the high-Z limit. (c) 2000 The American Physical Society.\n\n3. First results from the Freiburg Electron Beam Ion Trap FreEBIT\nIn the first measurements at the Freiburg electron beam ion trap FreEBIT, highly charged ions of Xe, Ba, W, Kr and Ar have been observed (with charge states up to 63+) by means of X-ray spectroscopy. Experiments with an optical imaging spectrograph have been also carried out. Forbidden transitions in the visible range have been measured, from Kr22+ and Xe32+ stored in the trap. The resolution achieved in the optical range is \u03b3/\u03b4\u03b3 \u2248 4000.\n\n4. Forbidden Transitions in the Visible Spectra of an Electron Beam Ion Trap (EBIT)\nIn an explorative study of visible spectra from an electron beam ion trap (EBIT), a variety of rare-gas ion species has been excited and stored. The spectra reveal several forbidden lines and also show peculiarities of general interest to EBIT users. The lifetime of the 3s23p2 3P2 level in Si-like Kr22+ has been measured as [(6.3\u00b10.3)ms]. The M1 transition 3s23p2 3P1\u20133P2 in the Si-like ion Mo28+ has been observed at (284.0\u00b10.2)nm, confirming an identification from tokamak observations by Denne et al. The 3d4 5D2\u20135D3 transition in Ti-like Au has been found at (353.2\u00b10.2)nm and thus the predicted isoelectronic trend been confirmed.\n\n5. The visible spectrum of highly charged ions: A window to fundamental physics\nThe observation of forbidden transitions in the visible range was the first experimental sign of the existence of highly charged ions in nature. Such lines can nowadays be excited in electron beam ion traps with excellent control of the ionic charge state, allowing their identification and precise determination of wavelengths and transition probabilities. The accuracy achieved in such experiments has been central to the study of nuclear size effects and quantum electrodynamic contributions, which are drastically magnified in highly charged ions, thus enabling the study of the underlying fundamental interactions in few-electron systems. At the same time, forbidden lines can be used to probe conditions in high temperature plasmas present in both astrophysical and laboratory environments.PACS Nos.: 31.30.Jv, 32.10.Fn, 32.30.Jc, 96.60.Tf, 97.10.Ex, 32.60.+i, 32.70.Cs, 12.20.Fv, 42.50.Xa\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the exploration of UV Visible spectroscopy in highly charged ions (HCI), various methodologies have been employed to probe the forbidden optical lines and transitions within these ions. The use of electron beam ion traps (EBITs) is a common technique across studies, providing a controlled environment for the excitation and observation of HCIs. The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory EBIT was instrumental in identifying visible transitions in Kr, Xe, and Ba ions, with ionization stages determined by sweeping the electron beam energy (1). Similarly, the Freiburg EBIT, FreEBIT, enabled the observation of HCIs such as Xe, Ba, W, and Kr, with a remarkable optical resolution (3). The EBIT was also used to measure the wavelength of magnetic dipole transitions in the ground term of Ti-like ytterbium, tungsten, and bismuth, contributing to the understanding of isoelectronic sequences and the reconciliation of prediction and experimental results in the high-Z limit (2). Forbidden transitions in the visible range were observed in Kr22+ and Xe32+, with a resolution of \u03b3/\u03b4\u03b3 \u2248 4000, highlighting the potential of EBITs for precise spectral analysis (3, 4). The identification of these forbidden lines and transitions was aided by atomic structure calculations, although many observations remained unidentified, indicating the complexities of HCI spectroscopy and the need for continued theoretical support (1). These methodologies collectively advance the understanding of HCI spectra, which is crucial for plasma diagnostics and the study of fundamental physics (5).",

Visible spectrum of highly charged ions: The forbidden optical lines of Kr, Xe, and Ba ions in  the Ar I to Kr I isoelectronic sequence\nWe present experimental data on visible transitions in highly charged ions observed in the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) electron beam ion traps, including results from lines within the ground-state configuration and the first excited configuration. Measurements of lines produced by Kr (q = 11+ to 22+), Xe (q = 18+ to 35+), and Ba (q = 28+ to 36+) ions, corresponding mainly to 3sl 3pm 3dn configurations, were carried out. The ionization stages were determined experimentally by sweeping the electron beam energy over the ionization threshold of each species. We propose possible identifications for the lines with the help of simple atomic structure calculations. However, most observed lines remained unidentified, demonstrating that the understanding of visible spectra from highly charged ions, even if obtained under nearly \"ideal\" experimental conditions, is still in its infancy. These spectral data may be useful for the diagnostics of magnetically confined plasmas and may set the stage for future measurements of radiative lifetimes. In our experiments, we used the emission from visible lines to image the intersection of the electron beam with a beam of neutral atoms injected into the trap at a right angle as well as the ion cloud in the trap. Under some conditions, the diameter of the ion cloud may be an order of magnitude larger than that of the electron beam.  PACS Nos.: 32.30Jc, 39.30+w, 52.59Rz\n\n2. UV light from the ground term of Ti-like ytterbium, tungsten, and bismuth\nWe have used an electron-beam ion trap to measure the wavelength of the J=2-3 magnetic dipole transition in the 3d{sup 4} ground term of Ti-like ytterbium, tungsten, and bismuth. This fills in a gap in previous measurements along this isoelectronic sequence, as well as extending previous work to the highest Z yet. With the addition of our results, measurements of this line now cover a sufficient range of Z to allow an interpolation of reliable wavelength estimates for the unmeasured members of the isoelectronic sequence from Z=52 to 83. We provide a table of these wavelengths for each member of the sequence in this range, and compare the measured wavelengths to recent calculations. Our results show that a long-standing discrepancy between prediction and experiment disappears in the high-Z limit. (c) 2000 The American Physical Society.\n\n3. First results from the Freiburg Electron Beam Ion Trap FreEBIT\nIn the first measurements at the Freiburg electron beam ion trap FreEBIT, highly charged ions of Xe, Ba, W, Kr and Ar have been observed (with charge states up to 63+) by means of X-ray spectroscopy. Experiments with an optical imaging spectrograph have been also carried out. Forbidden transitions in the visible range have been measured, from Kr22+ and Xe32+ stored in the trap. The resolution achieved in the optical range is \u03b3/\u03b4\u03b3 \u2248 4000.\n\n4. Forbidden Transitions in the Visible Spectra of an Electron Beam Ion Trap (EBIT)\nIn an explorative study of visible spectra from an electron beam ion trap (EBIT), a variety of rare-gas ion species has been excited and stored. The spectra reveal several forbidden lines and also show peculiarities of general interest to EBIT users. The lifetime of the 3s23p2 3P2 level in Si-like Kr22+ has been measured as [(6.3\u00b10.3)ms]. The M1 transition 3s23p2 3P1\u20133P2 in the Si-like ion Mo28+ has been observed at (284.0\u00b10.2)nm, confirming an identification from tokamak observations by Denne et al. The 3d4 5D2\u20135D3 transition in Ti-like Au has been found at (353.2\u00b10.2)nm and thus the predicted isoelectronic trend been confirmed.\n\n5. The visible spectrum of highly charged ions: A window to fundamental physics\nThe observation of forbidden transitions in the visible range was the first experimental sign of the existence of highly charged ions in nature. Such lines can nowadays be excited in electron beam ion traps with excellent control of the ionic charge state, allowing their identification and precise determination of wavelengths and transition probabilities. The accuracy achieved in such experiments has been central to the study of nuclear size effects and quantum electrodynamic contributions, which are drastically magnified in highly charged ions, thus enabling the study of the underlying fundamental interactions in few-electron systems. At the same time, forbidden lines can be used to probe conditions in high temperature plasmas present in both astrophysical and laboratory environments.PACS Nos.: 31.30.Jv, 32.10.Fn, 32.30.Jc, 96.60.Tf, 97.10.Ex, 32.60.+i, 32.70.Cs, 12.20.Fv, 42.50.Xa\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In a pioneering study, researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) provided experimental data on visible transitions in highly charged ions (HCIs), focusing on forbidden optical lines in Kr, Xe, and Ba ions within the Ar I to Kr I isoelectronic sequence. Despite the high-quality conditions of the electron beam ion traps used, many observed lines remained unidentified, highlighting the nascent stage of understanding visible spectra from HCIs and their potential applications in plasma diagnostics (1). Complementing this, researchers using an electron-beam ion trap at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Germany measured the wavelength of the J=2-3 magnetic dipole transition in the ground term of Ti-like ytterbium, tungsten, and bismuth, resolving a longstanding discrepancy between prediction and experiment in the high-z limit and providing reliable wavelength estimates for unmeasured members of the isoelectronic sequence (2). The Freiburg Electron Beam Ion Trap (FreEBIT) achieved significant results by observing forbidden transitions in the visible range for Kr22+ and Xe32+, with a notable optical resolution, thereby advancing the capabilities of optical imaging spectrographs in HCI research (3). Further exploring the visible spectra of HCIs, an exploratory study at the Flemish Institute for Nuclear Physics revealed several forbidden lines and offered insights into the use of electron beam ion traps for such analyses, including the measurement of the 3s23p2 3P2 level in Si-like Kr22+ and the M1 transition in Si-like Mo28+ (4). Lastly, the accuracy achieved in identifying and measuring forbidden transitions in HCIs has been instrumental in probing fundamental physics, including nuclear size effects and quantum electrodynamic contributions, as well as in studying high-temperature plasmas in both astrophysical and laboratory environments (5). Together, these studies underscore the evolution of UV Visible spectroscopy in HCIs, from initial experimental challenges to the current precision and applicability across various fields of research.",

Ultraviolet/vacuum-ultraviolet emission from a high power magnetron sputtering plasma with an aluminum target\nWe report the in situ measurement of the ultraviolet/vacuum-ultraviolet (UV/VUV) emission from a plasma produced by high power impulse magnetron sputtering with aluminum target, using argon as background gas. The UV/VUV detection system is based upon the quantification of the re-emitted fluorescence from a sodium salicylate layer that is placed in a housing inside the vacuum chamber, at 11\u2009cm from the center of the cathode. The detector is equipped with filters that allow for differentiating various spectral regions, and with a front collimating tube that provides a spatial resolution\u2009\u2009\u2248\u2009\u20090.5\u2009cm. Using various views of the plasma, the measured absolutely calibrated photon rates enable to calculate emissivities and irradiances based on a model of the ionization region. We present results that demonstrate that Al+ ions are responsible for most of the VUV irradiance. We also discuss the photoelectric emission due to irradiances on the target produced by high energy photons from resonance lines of Ar+.\n\n2. Prediction of UV spectra and UV-radiation damage in actual plasma etching processes using on-wafer monitoring technique\nUV radiation during plasma processing affects the surface of materials. Nevertheless, the interaction of UV photons with surface is not clearly understood because of the difficulty in monitoring photons during plasma processing. For this purpose, we have previously proposed an on-wafer monitoring technique for UV photons. For this study, using the combination of this on-wafer monitoring technique and a neural network, we established a relationship between the data obtained from the on-wafer monitoring technique and UV spectra. Also, we obtained absolute intensities of UV radiation by calibrating arbitrary units of UV intensity with a 126 nm excimer lamp. As a result, UV spectra and their absolute intensities could be predicted with the on-wafer monitoring. Furthermore, we developed a prediction system with the on-wafer monitoring technique to simulate UV-radiation damage in dielectric films during plasma etching. UV-induced damage in SiOC films was predicted in this study. Our prediction results of damage...\n\n3. VUV Spectral Irradiance Measurements in H\n                    2\n                    /He/Ar Microwave Plasmas and Comparison with Solar Data\nMicrowave plasmas with H2 and H2/rare gas mixtures are convenient sources of VUV radiation for laboratory simulations of astrophysical media. We recently undertook an extensive study to characterize microwave plasmas in an H2/He gas mixture in order to optimize a VUV solar simulator over the 115\u2013170 nm spectral range. In this paper, we extend our investigation to the effect of the addition of Ar into H2/He plasma on the VUV spectral irradiance. Our study combines various optical diagnostics such as a VUV spectrometer and optical emission spectroscopy. Quantitative measurements of the spectral irradiance and photons flux in different mixtures are accomplished using a combination of VUV spectrometry and chemical actinometry. Results show that the Ar addition into H2/He plasma largely affects the predominant emissions of the hydrogen Ly\u03b1 line (121.6 nm) and H2 (B1\u03a3u\u2013X1\u03a3g) band (150\u2013170 nm). While a microwave plasma with 1.4% H2/He is required to mimic the entire VUV solar spectrum in the 115\u2013170 nm range, the combination with 1.28% H2/35% Ar/He is the best alternative to obtain a quasi-monochromatic spectrum with emission dominated by the Ly\u03b1 line. The maximum of the spectral irradiance is significantly higher in the ternary mixtures compared to the binary mixture of 1.4% H2/He. Further Ar increase yielded lower spectral irradiance and absolute photon fluxes. Our measured spectral irradiances are compared to VUV solar data in the 115\u2013170 nm range, emphasizing the use of microwave plasmas in astrophysical studies and laboratory simulations of planetary atmospheres.\n\n4. A microwave plasma source for VUV atmospheric photochemistry\nMicrowave plasma discharges working at low pressure are nowadays a well-developed technique mainly used to provide radiation at different wavelengths. The aim of this work is to show that those discharges are an efficient windowless vacuum ultra-violet (VUV) photon source for planetary atmospheric photochemistry experiments. To do this, we use a surfatron-type discharge with a neon gas flow in the mbar pressure range coupled to a photochemical reactor. Working in the VUV range allows nitrogen-dominated atmospheres to be focused on (\u03bb\u2009\u2009<\u2009\u2009100\u2009nm). The experimental setup makes sure that no energy sources (electrons, metastable atoms) other than the VUV photons interact with the reactive medium. Neon has two resonance lines at 73.6 and 74.3\u2009nm that behave differently depending on the pressure or power conditions. In parallel, the VUV photon flux emitted at 73.6\u2009nm has been experimentally estimated in different pressure and power conditions, and varies in a large range between 2\u2009\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u20091013 ph s\u22121 cm\u22122 and 4\u2009\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u20091014 ph s\u22121 cm\u22122, which is comparable to a VUV synchrotron photon flux. Our first case study is the atmosphere of Titan and its N2\u2013CH4 atmosphere. With this VUV source, the production of HCN and C2N2, two major Titan compounds, is detected, ensuring the suitability of the source for atmospheric photochemistry experiments.\n\n5. In situmeasurement of VUV/UV radiation from low-pressure microwave-produced plasma in Ar/O2gas mixtures\nUltraviolet (UV) and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) spectral irradiance is determined in low-pressure microwave-produced plasma, which is regularly used for polymer surface treatment. The re-emitted fluorescence in the UV/VIS spectral range from a sodium salicylate layer is measured. This fluorescence is related to VUV/UV radiation in different spectral bands based on cut-off filters. The background produced by direct emitted radiation in the fluorescence spectral region is quantified using a specific background filter, thus enabling the use of the whole fluorescence spectral range. A novel procedure is applied to determine the absolute value of the VUV/UV irradiance on a substrate. For that, an independent measurement of the absolute spectral emissivity of the plasma in the UV is performed. The measured irradiances on a substrate from a 25 Pa Ar/O2-produced plasma are in the range of 1015\u20131016 (photon s\u22121cm\u22122). These values include the contribution from impurities present in the discharge.\n\n###\n\n",

The second study utilized an on-wafer monitoring technique, complemented by a neural network to predict UV spectra and intensities, thereby enabling the simulation of UV-radiation damage in plasma etching processes (2). The third study extended its investigation to H2/He/Ar microwave plasmas, employing a VUV spectrometer and chemical actinometry to measure spectral irradiance and photon fluxes, providing insights into the effects of plasma composition on VUV emission patterns (3). A surfatron-type discharge with a neon gas flow was used in the fourth study, focusing on VUV photochemistry experiments and the photon flux emitted by neon's resonance lines, ensuring the isolation of VUV photons for reactive medium interactions (4). Lastly, the fifth study utilized a sodium salicylate layer and cut-off filters to measure VUV/UV irradiance from a 25 Pa Ar/O2-produced plasma, incorporating a novel procedure to determine absolute irradiance values (5).

Quantitative measurements of the spectral irradiance and photons flux in different mixtures are accomplished using a combination of VUV spectrometry and chemical actinometry. Results show that the Ar addition into H2/He plasma largely affects the predominant emissions of the hydrogen Ly\u03b1 line (121.6 nm) and H2 (B1\u03a3u\u2013X1\u03a3g) band (150\u2013170 nm). While a microwave plasma with 1.4% H2/He is required to mimic the entire VUV solar spectrum in the 115\u2013170 nm range, the combination with 1.28% H2/35% Ar/He is the best alternative to obtain a quasi-monochromatic spectrum with emission dominated by the Ly\u03b1 line. The maximum of the spectral irradiance is significantly higher in the ternary mixtures compared to the binary mixture of 1.4% H2/He. Further Ar increase yielded lower spectral irradiance and absolute photon fluxes. Our measured spectral irradiances are compared to VUV solar data in the 115\u2013170 nm range, emphasizing the use of microwave plasmas in astrophysical studies and laboratory simulations of planetary atmospheres.\n\n4. A microwave plasma source for VUV atmospheric photochemistry\nMicrowave plasma discharges working at low pressure are nowadays a well-developed technique mainly used to provide radiation at different wavelengths. The aim of this work is to show that those discharges are an efficient windowless vacuum ultra-violet (VUV) photon source for planetary atmospheric photochemistry experiments. To do this, we use a surfatron-type discharge with a neon gas flow in the mbar pressure range coupled to a photochemical reactor. Working in the VUV range allows nitrogen-dominated atmospheres to be focused on (\u03bb\u2009\u2009<\u2009\u2009100\u2009nm). The experimental setup makes sure that no energy sources (electrons, metastable atoms) other than the VUV photons interact with the reactive medium. Neon has two resonance lines at 73.6 and 74.3\u2009nm that behave differently depending on the pressure or power conditions. In parallel, the VUV photon flux emitted at 73.6\u2009nm has been experimentally estimated in different pressure and power conditions, and varies in a large range between 2\u2009\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u20091013 ph s\u22121 cm\u22122 and 4\u2009\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u20091014 ph s\u22121 cm\u22122, which is comparable to a VUV synchrotron photon flux. Our first case study is the atmosphere of Titan and its N2\u2013CH4 atmosphere. With this VUV source, the production of HCN and C2N2, two major Titan compounds, is detected, ensuring the suitability of the source for atmospheric photochemistry experiments.\n\n5. In situmeasurement of VUV/UV radiation from low-pressure microwave-produced plasma in Ar/O2gas mixtures\nUltraviolet (UV) and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) spectral irradiance is determined in low-pressure microwave-produced plasma, which is regularly used for polymer surface treatment. The re-emitted fluorescence in the UV/VIS spectral range from a sodium salicylate layer is measured. This fluorescence is related to VUV/UV radiation in different spectral bands based on cut-off filters. The background produced by direct emitted radiation in the fluorescence spectral region is quantified using a specific background filter, thus enabling the use of the whole fluorescence spectral range. A novel procedure is applied to determine the absolute value of the VUV/UV irradiance on a substrate. For that, an independent measurement of the absolute spectral emissivity of the plasma in the UV is performed. The measured irradiances on a substrate from a 25 Pa Ar/O2-produced plasma are in the range of 1015\u20131016 (photon s\u22121cm\u22122). These values include the contribution from impurities present in the discharge.\n\n###\n\n",

The interaction of VUV photons with surfaces during plasma processing is also being elucidated, with on-wafer monitoring aiding in the prediction of UV-radiation damage in dielectric films (2). Microwave plasmas, particularly in H2/He mixtures, are being used to mimic astrophysical media, with the spectral irradiance being fine-tuned by the addition of Ar, thereby offering controlled conditions for materials research (3). Furthermore, microwave plasma discharges have emerged as efficient sources of VUV photons for planetary atmospheric photochemistry, enabling nitrogen-dominated atmosphere studies with high spectral resolution (4). Lastly, in-situ measurements of VUV/UV radiation from microwave-produced plasmas in Ar/O2 mixtures have been reported, providing insights into the irradiance on substrates and the role of impurities in plasma-induced processes (5).

Ultraviolet/vacuum-ultraviolet emission from a high power magnetron sputtering plasma with an aluminum target\nWe report the in situ measurement of the ultraviolet/vacuum-ultraviolet (UV/VUV) emission from a plasma produced by high power impulse magnetron sputtering with aluminum target, using argon as background gas. The UV/VUV detection system is based upon the quantification of the re-emitted fluorescence from a sodium salicylate layer that is placed in a housing inside the vacuum chamber, at 11\u2009cm from the center of the cathode. The detector is equipped with filters that allow for differentiating various spectral regions, and with a front collimating tube that provides a spatial resolution\u2009\u2009\u2248\u2009\u20090.5\u2009cm. Using various views of the plasma, the measured absolutely calibrated photon rates enable to calculate emissivities and irradiances based on a model of the ionization region. We present results that demonstrate that Al+ ions are responsible for most of the VUV irradiance. We also discuss the photoelectric emission due to irradiances on the target produced by high energy photons from resonance lines of Ar+.\n\n2. Prediction of UV spectra and UV-radiation damage in actual plasma etching processes using on-wafer monitoring technique\nUV radiation during plasma processing affects the surface of materials. Nevertheless, the interaction of UV photons with surface is not clearly understood because of the difficulty in monitoring photons during plasma processing. For this purpose, we have previously proposed an on-wafer monitoring technique for UV photons. For this study, using the combination of this on-wafer monitoring technique and a neural network, we established a relationship between the data obtained from the on-wafer monitoring technique and UV spectra. Also, we obtained absolute intensities of UV radiation by calibrating arbitrary units of UV intensity with a 126 nm excimer lamp. As a result, UV spectra and their absolute intensities could be predicted with the on-wafer monitoring. Furthermore, we developed a prediction system with the on-wafer monitoring technique to simulate UV-radiation damage in dielectric films during plasma etching. UV-induced damage in SiOC films was predicted in this study. Our prediction results of damage...\n\n3.

Comparison of electron heating and energy loss mechanisms in an RF plasma jet operated in argon and helium\nThe \u03bc-APPJ is a well-investigated atmospheric pressure RF plasma jet. Up to now, it has mainly been operated using helium as feed gas due to stability restrictions. However, the COST-Jet design including precise electrical probes now offers the stability and reproducibility to create equi-operational plasmas in helium as well as in argon. In this publication, we compare fundamental plasma parameters and physical processes inside the COST reference microplasma jet, a capacitively coupled RF atmospheric pressure plasma jet, under operation in argon and in helium. Differences already observable by the naked eye are reflected in differences in the power-voltage characteristic for both gases. Using an electrical model and a power balance, we calculated the electron density and temperature at 0.6 W to be 9 \u00d7 10 17 m \u2212 3 , 1.2 eV and 7.8 \u00d7 10 16 m \u2212 3 , 1.7 eV for argon and helium, respectively. In case of helium, a considerable part of the discharge power is dissipated in elastic electron-atom collisions, while for argon most of the input power is used for ionization. Phase-resolved optical emission spectroscopy reveals differently pronounced heating mechanisms. Whereas bulk heating is more prominent in argon compared to helium, the opposite trend is observed for sheath heating. This also explains the different behavior observed in the power-voltage characteristics.\n\n2. An atmospheric pressure plasma source\nAn atmospheric pressure plasma source operated by radio frequency power has been developed. This source produces a unique discharge that is volumetric and homogeneous at atmospheric pressure with a gas temperature below 300\u200a\u00b0C. It also produces a large quantity of oxygen atoms, \u223c5\u00d71015\u200acm\u22123, which has important value for materials applications. A theoretical model shows electron densities of 0.2\u20132\u00d71011\u200acm\u22123 and characteristic electron energies of 2\u20134 eV for helium discharges at a power level of 3\u201330 W\u200acm\u22123.\n\n3. Determination of NO densities in a surface dielectric barrier discharge using optical emission spectroscopy\nA new computationally assisted diagnostic to measure NO densities in atmospheric-pressure microplasmas by Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) is developed and validated against absorption spectroscopy in a volume Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD). The OES method is then applied to a twin surface DBD operated in N 2 to measure the NO density as a function of the O 2 admixture ( 0.1%\u2013 1%). The underlying rate equation model reveals that NO ( A 2 \u03a3 + ) is primarily excited by reactions of the ground state NO ( X 2 \u03a0 ) with metastables N 2 ( A 3 \u03a3 u + ).A new computationally assisted diagnostic to measure NO densities in atmospheric-pressure microplasmas by Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) is developed and validated against absorption spectroscopy in a volume Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD).

Spatially resolved diagnostics on a microscale atmospheric pressure plasma jet\nDespite enormous potential for technological applications, fundamentals of stable non-equilibrium micro-plasmas at ambient pressure are still only partly understood. Micro-plasma jets are one sub-group of these plasma sources. For an understanding it is particularly important to analyse transport phenomena of energy and particles within and between the core and effluent of the discharge. The complexity of the problem requires the combination and correlation of various highly sophisticated diagnostics yielding different information with an extremely high temporal and spatial resolution. A specially designed rf microscale atmospheric pressure plasma jet (\u03bc-APPJ) provides excellent access for optical diagnostics to the discharge volume and the effluent region. This allows detailed investigations of the discharge dynamics and energy transport mechanisms from the discharge to the effluent. Here we present examples for diagnostics applicable to different regions and combine the results. The diagnostics applied are optical emission spectroscopy (OES) in the visible and ultraviolet and two-photon absorption laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy. By the latter spatially resolved absolutely calibrated density maps of atomic oxygen have been determined for the effluent. OES yields an insight into energy transport mechanisms from the core into the effluent.

Characterization of an RF-driven argon plasma at atmospheric pressure using broadband absorption and optical emission spectroscopy\nAtmospheric pressure plasmas in argon are of particular interest due to the production of highly excited and reactive species enabling numerous plasma-aided applications. In this contribution, we report on absolute optical emission and absorption spectroscopy of a radio frequency (RF) driven capacitively coupled argon glow discharge operated in a parallel-plate configuration. This enabled the study of all key parameters including electron density and temperature, gas temperature, and absolute densities of atoms in highly electronically excited states. Space and time-averaged electron density and temperature were determined from the measurement of the absolute intensity of the electron-atom bremsstrahlung in the visible range. Considering the non-Maxwellian electron energy distribution function, an electron temperature ( T e) of 2.1\u2009eV and an electron density ( n e) of 1.1 \u00d7 10 19 m \u2212 3 were obtained. The time-averaged and spatially resolved absolute densities of atoms in the metastable ( 1 s 5 and 1 s 3) and resonant ( 1 s 4 and 1 s 2) states of argon in the pure Ar and Ar/He mixture were obtained by broadband absorption spectroscopy. The 1 s 5 metastable atoms had the largest density near the sheath region with a maximum value of 8 \u00d7 10 17 m \u2212 3, while all other 1s states had densities of at most 2 \u00d7 10 17 m \u2212 3. The dominant production and loss mechanisms of these atoms were discussed, in particular, the role of radiation trapping. We conclude with comparison of the plasma properties of the argon RF glow discharges with the more common He equivalent and highlight their differences.\n\n###\n\n",

Comparison of electron heating and energy loss mechanisms in an RF plasma jet operated in argon and helium\nThe \u03bc-APPJ is a well-investigated atmospheric pressure RF plasma jet. Up to now, it has mainly been operated using helium as feed gas due to stability restrictions. However, the COST-Jet design including precise electrical probes now offers the stability and reproducibility to create equi-operational plasmas in helium as well as in argon. In this publication, we compare fundamental plasma parameters and physical processes inside the COST reference microplasma jet, a capacitively coupled RF atmospheric pressure plasma jet, under operation in argon and in helium. Differences already observable by the naked eye are reflected in differences in the power-voltage characteristic for both gases. Using an electrical model and a power balance, we calculated the electron density and temperature at 0.6 W to be 9 \u00d7 10 17 m \u2212 3 , 1.2 eV and 7.8 \u00d7 10 16 m \u2212 3 , 1.7 eV for argon and helium, respectively. In case of helium, a considerable part of the discharge power is dissipated in elastic electron-atom collisions, while for argon most of the input power is used for ionization. Phase-resolved optical emission spectroscopy reveals differently pronounced heating mechanisms. Whereas bulk heating is more prominent in argon compared to helium, the opposite trend is observed for sheath heating. This also explains the different behavior observed in the power-voltage characteristics.\n\n2.

A theoretical model shows electron densities of 0.2\u20132\u00d71011\u200acm\u22123 and characteristic electron energies of 2\u20134 eV for helium discharges at a power level of 3\u201330 W\u200acm\u22123.\n\n3.

Spatially resolved diagnostics on a microscale atmospheric pressure plasma jet\nDespite enormous potential for technological applications, fundamentals of stable non-equilibrium micro-plasmas at ambient pressure are still only partly understood. Micro-plasma jets are one sub-group of these plasma sources. For an understanding it is particularly important to analyse transport phenomena of energy and particles within and between the core and effluent of the discharge. The complexity of the problem requires the combination and correlation of various highly sophisticated diagnostics yielding different information with an extremely high temporal and spatial resolution. A specially designed rf microscale atmospheric pressure plasma jet (\u03bc-APPJ) provides excellent access for optical diagnostics to the discharge volume and the effluent region. This allows detailed investigations of the discharge dynamics and energy transport mechanisms from the discharge to the effluent. Here we present examples for diagnostics applicable to different regions and combine the results. The diagnostics applied are optical emission spectroscopy (OES) in the visible and ultraviolet and two-photon absorption laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy. By the latter spatially resolved absolutely calibrated density maps of atomic oxygen have been determined for the effluent.

High N\n            2\n            Fixation in and Near the Gulf Stream Consistent with a Circulation Control on Diazotrophy\nThe stoichiometry of physical nutrient supply may provide a constraint on the spatial distribution and rate of marine nitrogen (N2) fixation. Yet agreement between the N2 fixation rates inferred from nutrient supply and those directly measured has been lacking. The relative transport of phosphate and nitrate across the Gulf Stream suggests that 3\u20136\u2009Tg\u2009N\u2009year\u22121 must be fixed to maintain steady nutrient stoichiometry in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre. Here we show direct measurements of N2 fixation consistent with these estimates, suggesting elevated N2 fixation in and near the Gulf Stream. At some locations across the Gulf Stream, we measured diazotroph abundances and N2 fixation rates that are 1\u20133 orders of magnitude greater than previously measured in the central North Atlantic subtropical gyre. In combination, rate measurements and gene abundances suggest that biogeochemical budgets can be a robust predictive tool for N2 fixation hot spots in the global ocean.\n\n2. Biological N2 Fixation in the Upwelling Region off NW Iberia: Magnitude, Relevance, and Players\nThe classical paradigm about marine N2 fixation establishes that this process is mainly constrained to nitrogen-poor tropical and subtropical regions, and sustained by the colonial cyanobacterium Trichodesmium spp. and diatom-diazotroph symbiosis. However, the application of molecular techniques allowed determining a high phylogenic diversity and a wide distribution of marine diazotrophs, which extends the range of ocean environments where biological N2 fixation may be relevant. Between February 2014 and December 2015, we carried out 10 one-day samplings in the upwelling system off NW Iberia in order to: 1) investigate the seasonal variability in the magnitude of N2 fixation, 2) determine its biogeochemical role as a mechanism of new nitrogen supply, and 3) quantify the main diazotrophs in the region under contrasting hydrographic regimes. Our results indicate that the magnitude of N2 fixation in this region was relatively low (0.001\u00b10.002 \u2013 0.095\u00b10.024 \u00b5mol N m-3 d-1), comparable to the lower-end of rates described for the subtropical NE Atlantic. Maximum rates were observed at surface during both upwelling and relaxation conditions. The comparison with nitrate diffusive fluxes revealed the minor role of N2 fixation (2 fixation activity detected in the region. Quantitative PCR targeting the nifH gene revealed the highest abundances of two sublineages of Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa or UCYN-A (UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2) mainly at surface waters during upwelling and relaxation conditions, and of Gammaproteobacteria \u03b3-24774A11 at deep waters during downwelling. Maximum abundance for the three groups were up to 6.7 \u00d7 102, 1.5 \u00d7 103 and 2.4 \u00d7 104 nifH copies L-1, respectively. Our findings demonstrate measurable N2 fixation activity and presence of diazotrophs throughout the year in a nitrogen-rich temperate region.\n\n3. Phosphate Depletion in the Western North Atlantic Ocean\nSurface waters of the subtropical Sargasso Sea contain dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP) concentrations of 0.2 to 1.0 nanomolar, which are sufficiently low to result in phosphorus control of primary production. The DIP concentrations in this area (which receives high inputs of iron-rich dust from arid regions of North Africa) are one to two orders of magnitude lower than surface levels in the North Pacific (where eolian iron inputs are much lower and water column denitrification is much more substantial). These data indicate a severe relative phosphorus depletion in the Atlantic. We hypothesize that nitrogen versus phosphorus limitation of primary production in the present-day ocean may be closely linked to iron supply through control of dinitrogen (N             2             ) fixation, an iron-intensive metabolic process. Although the oceanic phosphorus inventory may set the upper limit for the total amount of organic matter produced in the ocean over geological time scales, at any instant in geological time, oceanic primary production may fall below this limit because of a persistent insufficient iron supply. By controlling N             2             fixation, iron may control not only nitrogen versus phosphorus limitation but also carbon fixation and export stoichiometry and hence biological sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide.\n\n4. Evidence of high N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation rates in the temperate northeast Atlantic\nAbstract. Diazotrophic activity and primary production (PP) were investigated along two transects (Belgica BG2014/14 and GEOVIDE cruises) off the western Iberian Margin and the Bay of Biscay in May\u00a02014. Substantial N2 fixation activity was observed at 8 of the 10 stations sampled, ranging overall from 81 to 384\u2009\u00b5mol\u2009N\u2009m\u22122\u2009d\u22121 (0.7 to 8.2\u2009nmol\u2009N\u2009L\u22121\u2009d\u22121), with two sites close to the Iberian Margin situated between 38.8 and 40.7\u2218\u2009N yielding rates reaching up to 1355 and 1533\u2009\u00b5mol\u2009N\u2009m\u22122\u2009d\u22121. Primary production was relatively lower along the Iberian Margin, with rates ranging from 33 to 59\u2009mmol\u2009C\u2009m\u22122\u2009d\u22121, while it increased towards the northwest away from the peninsula, reaching as high as 135\u2009mmol\u2009C\u2009m\u22122\u2009d\u22121. In agreement with the area-averaged Chl\u00a0a satellite data contemporaneous with our study period, our results revealed that post-bloom conditions prevailed at most sites, while at the northwesternmost station the bloom was still ongoing. When converted to carbon uptake using Redfield stoichiometry, N2 fixation could support 1\u2009% to 3\u2009% of daily PP in the euphotic layer at most sites, except at the two most active sites where this contribution to daily PP could reach up to 25\u2009%. At the two sites where N2 fixation activity was the highest, the prymnesiophyte\u2013symbiont Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa (UCYN-A) dominated the nifH sequence pool, while the remaining recovered sequences belonged to non-cyanobacterial phylotypes. At all the other sites, however, the recovered nifH sequences were exclusively assigned phylogenetically to non-cyanobacterial phylotypes. The intense N2 fixation activities recorded at the time of our study were likely promoted by the availability of phytoplankton-derived organic matter produced during the spring bloom, as evidenced by the significant surface particulate organic carbon concentrations. Also, the presence of excess phosphorus signature in surface waters seemed to contribute to sustaining N2 fixation, particularly at the sites with extreme activities. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of the unexpectedly high N2 fixation in productive waters of the temperate North Atlantic and highlight the importance of N2 fixation for future assessment of the global N inventory.\n\n5. High Rates of N\n            2\n            Fixation in Temperate, Western North Atlantic Coastal Waters Expand the Realm of Marine Diazotrophy\nDinitrogen (N2) fixation can alleviate N limitation of primary productivity by introducing fixed nitrogen (N) to the world's oceans. Although measurements of pelagic marine N2 fixation are predominantly from oligotrophic oceanic regions, where N limitation is thought to favor growth of diazotrophic microbes, here we report high rates of N2 fixation from seven cruises spanning four seasons in temperate, western North Atlantic coastal waters along the North American continental shelf between Cape Hatteras and Nova Scotia, an area representing 6.4% of the North Atlantic continental shelf area. Integrating average areal rates of N2 fixation during each season and for each domain in the study area, the estimated N input from N2 fixation to this temperate shelf system is 0.02 Tmol N/year, an amount equivalent to that previously estimated for the entire North Atlantic continental shelf. Unicellular group A cyanobacteria (UCYN\u2010A) were most often the dominant diazotrophic group expressing nifH, a gene encoding the nitrogenase enzyme, throughout the study area during all seasons. This expands the domain of these diazotrophs to include coastal waters where dissolved N concentrations are not always depleted. Further, the high rates of N2 fixation and diazotroph diversity along the western North Atlantic continental shelf underscore the need to reexamine the biogeography and the activity of diazotrophs along continental margins. Accounting for this substantial but previously overlooked source of new N to marine systems necessitates revisions to global marine N budgets.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The methodologies employed to estimate nitrogen fixation rates in the Atlantic Ocean reveal a diverse approach to measuring and understanding the process. Direct measurements of N2 fixation, as reported in studies off the Gulf Stream and in temperate, western North Atlantic coastal waters, utilized molecular techniques to quantify diazotroph abundances and rate determinations through lab experiments (1, 4, 5). These studies opposed those that did not directly measure fixation rates, instead focusing on the relationship between nitrogen supply and fixation, as inferred from nutrient stoichiometry in the subtropical gyres (1), or through biogeochemical models, which quantify the relevance of fixation for regional nutrient Budgets (2). The integration of these various methodologies, from molecular biology to biogeochemical modeling, provides a multifaceted view of nitrogen fixation rates, revealing high rates in regions where diazotrophs are abundant and biogeochemical cycles are significant (2, 4, 5). These findings challenge previous assumptions about the spatial consistency of nitrogen fixation and suggest a more complex dynamic influenced by both biogeochemical processes and the presence of diazotrophs in nitrogen-rich waters (1, 2, 4, 5). The integration of molecular biology, biogeochemistry, and oceanographic modeling offers a more nuanced understanding of marine diazotrophy, which is crucial for refining global N budgets and investigating the ecological implications of nitrogen fixation in the changing Atlantic Ocean (1, 2, 4, 5).\n\n",

Further, the high rates of N2 fixation and diazotroph diversity along the western North Atlantic continental shelf underscore the need to reexamine the biogeography and the activity of diazotrophs along continental margins. Accounting for this substantial but previously overlooked source of new N to marine systems necessitates revisions to global marine N budgets.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " Recent studies have highlighted the significance of nitrogen fixation rates in the Atlantic Ocean, revealing a higher prevalence and activity of diazotrophs than previously thought. The concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrate in the Atlantic, particularly in the subtropical region, is lower than in other oceanic areas, leading to phosphorus limitation of primary production and potentially controlling the spatial distribution of diazotrophy (3). Direct measurements of N2 fixation in the Gulf Stream region have shown consistent with estimates derived from nutrient supply, suggesting a potential biogeochemical feedback mechanism in the nitrogen cycle (1). Furthermore, research in the upwelling region off NW Iberia has found that while N2 fixation rates are relatively low, they are not insignificant and are influenced by nutrient supply and biogeochemical conditions, indicating a more complex interplay between physical and biological processes (2). The high rates of N2 fixation reported in temperate coastal waters, often attributed to the colonial cyanobacterium Trichodesmium spp., are not limited to tropical and subtropical regions but also extend to the temperate North Atlantic, challenging traditional biogeochemical models (5). Additionally, the discovery of high N2 fixation rates in the western North Atlantic, largely driven by the cyanobacterium Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa, suggests a significant contribution to the region's nitrogen inventory and the need to refine global marine nitrogen budgets (4). Collectively, these studies underscore the complexity of nitrogen fixation in the Atlantic Ocean and the importance of integrating biogeochemical cycling with regional and global climate dynamics to understand the past, present, and future of marine nitrogen (N).\n\n",

High N\n            2\n            Fixation in and Near the Gulf Stream Consistent with a Circulation Control on Diazotrophy\nThe stoichiometry of physical nutrient supply may provide a constraint on the spatial distribution and rate of marine nitrogen (N2) fixation. Yet agreement between the N2 fixation rates inferred from nutrient supply and those directly measured has been lacking. The relative transport of phosphate and nitrate across the Gulf Stream suggests that 3\u20136\u2009Tg\u2009N\u2009year\u22121 must be fixed to maintain steady nutrient stoichiometry in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre. Here we show direct measurements of N2 fixation consistent with these estimates, suggesting elevated N2 fixation in and near the Gulf Stream. At some locations across the Gulf Stream, we measured diazotroph abundances and N2 fixation rates that are 1\u20133 orders of magnitude greater than previously measured in the central North Atlantic subtropical gyre. In combination, rate measurements and gene abundances suggest that biogeochemical budgets can be a robust predictive tool for N2 fixation hot spots in the global ocean.\n\n2. Biological N2 Fixation in the Upwelling Region off NW Iberia: Magnitude, Relevance, and Players\nThe classical paradigm about marine N2 fixation establishes that this process is mainly constrained to nitrogen-poor tropical and subtropical regions, and sustained by the colonial cyanobacterium Trichodesmium spp. and diatom-diazotroph symbiosis. However, the application of molecular techniques allowed determining a high phylogenic diversity and a wide distribution of marine diazotrophs, which extends the range of ocean environments where biological N2 fixation may be relevant. Between February 2014 and December 2015, we carried out 10 one-day samplings in the upwelling system off NW Iberia in order to: 1) investigate the seasonal variability in the magnitude of N2 fixation, 2) determine its biogeochemical role as a mechanism of new nitrogen supply, and 3) quantify the main diazotrophs in the region under contrasting hydrographic regimes. Our results indicate that the magnitude of N2 fixation in this region was relatively low (0.001\u00b10.002 \u2013 0.095\u00b10.024 \u00b5mol N m-3 d-1), comparable to the lower-end of rates described for the subtropical NE Atlantic. Maximum rates were observed at surface during both upwelling and relaxation conditions. The comparison with nitrate diffusive fluxes revealed the minor role of N2 fixation (2 fixation activity detected in the region. Quantitative PCR targeting the nifH gene revealed the highest abundances of two sublineages of Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa or UCYN-A (UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2) mainly at surface waters during upwelling and relaxation conditions, and of Gammaproteobacteria \u03b3-24774A11 at deep waters during downwelling. Maximum abundance for the three groups were up to 6.7 \u00d7 102, 1.5 \u00d7 103 and 2.4 \u00d7 104 nifH copies L-1, respectively. Our findings demonstrate measurable N2 fixation activity and presence of diazotrophs throughout the year in a nitrogen-rich temperate region.\n\n3. Phosphate Depletion in the Western North Atlantic Ocean\nSurface waters of the subtropical Sargasso Sea contain dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP) concentrations of 0.2 to 1.0 nanomolar, which are sufficiently low to result in phosphorus control of primary production. The DIP concentrations in this area (which receives high inputs of iron-rich dust from arid regions of North Africa) are one to two orders of magnitude lower than surface levels in the North Pacific (where eolian iron inputs are much lower and water column denitrification is much more substantial). These data indicate a severe relative phosphorus depletion in the Atlantic. We hypothesize that nitrogen versus phosphorus limitation of primary production in the present-day ocean may be closely linked to iron supply through control of dinitrogen (N             2             ) fixation, an iron-intensive metabolic process. Although the oceanic phosphorus inventory may set the upper limit for the total amount of organic matter produced in the ocean over geological time scales, at any instant in geological time, oceanic primary production may fall below this limit because of a persistent insufficient iron supply. By controlling N             2             fixation, iron may control not only nitrogen versus phosphorus limitation but also carbon fixation and export stoichiometry and hence biological sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide.\n\n4. Evidence of high N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation rates in the temperate northeast Atlantic\nAbstract. Diazotrophic activity and primary production (PP) were investigated along two transects (Belgica BG2014/14 and GEOVIDE cruises) off the western Iberian Margin and the Bay of Biscay in May\u00a02014. Substantial N2 fixation activity was observed at 8 of the 10 stations sampled, ranging overall from 81 to 384\u2009\u00b5mol\u2009N\u2009m\u22122\u2009d\u22121 (0.7 to 8.2\u2009nmol\u2009N\u2009L\u22121\u2009d\u22121), with two sites close to the Iberian Margin situated between 38.8 and 40.7\u2218\u2009N yielding rates reaching up to 1355 and 1533\u2009\u00b5mol\u2009N\u2009m\u22122\u2009d\u22121. Primary production was relatively lower along the Iberian Margin, with rates ranging from 33 to 59\u2009mmol\u2009C\u2009m\u22122\u2009d\u22121, while it increased towards the northwest away from the peninsula, reaching as high as 135\u2009mmol\u2009C\u2009m\u22122\u2009d\u22121. In agreement with the area-averaged Chl\u00a0a satellite data contemporaneous with our study period, our results revealed that post-bloom conditions prevailed at most sites, while at the northwesternmost station the bloom was still ongoing. When converted to carbon uptake using Redfield stoichiometry, N2 fixation could support 1\u2009% to 3\u2009% of daily PP in the euphotic layer at most sites, except at the two most active sites where this contribution to daily PP could reach up to 25\u2009%. At the two sites where N2 fixation activity was the highest, the prymnesiophyte\u2013symbiont Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa (UCYN-A) dominated the nifH sequence pool, while the remaining recovered sequences belonged to non-cyanobacterial phylotypes. At all the other sites, however, the recovered nifH sequences were exclusively assigned phylogenetically to non-cyanobacterial phylotypes. The intense N2 fixation activities recorded at the time of our study were likely promoted by the availability of phytoplankton-derived organic matter produced during the spring bloom, as evidenced by the significant surface particulate organic carbon concentrations. Also, the presence of excess phosphorus signature in surface waters seemed to contribute to sustaining N2 fixation, particularly at the sites with extreme activities. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of the unexpectedly high N2 fixation in productive waters of the temperate North Atlantic and highlight the importance of N2 fixation for future assessment of the global N inventory.\n\n5. High Rates of N\n            2\n            Fixation in Temperate, Western North Atlantic Coastal Waters Expand the Realm of Marine Diazotrophy\nDinitrogen (N2) fixation can alleviate N limitation of primary productivity by introducing fixed nitrogen (N) to the world's oceans. Although measurements of pelagic marine N2 fixation are predominantly from oligotrophic oceanic regions, where N limitation is thought to favor growth of diazotrophic microbes, here we report high rates of N2 fixation from seven cruises spanning four seasons in temperate, western North Atlantic coastal waters along the North American continental shelf between Cape Hatteras and Nova Scotia, an area representing 6.4% of the North Atlantic continental shelf area. Integrating average areal rates of N2 fixation during each season and for each domain in the study area, the estimated N input from N2 fixation to this temperate shelf system is 0.02 Tmol N/year, an amount equivalent to that previously estimated for the entire North Atlantic continental shelf. Unicellular group A cyanobacteria (UCYN\u2010A) were most often the dominant diazotrophic group expressing nifH, a gene encoding the nitrogenase enzyme, throughout the study area during all seasons. This expands the domain of these diazotrophs to include coastal waters where dissolved N concentrations are not always depleted. Further, the high rates of N2 fixation and diazotroph diversity along the western North Atlantic continental shelf underscore the need to reexamine the biogeography and the activity of diazotrophs along continental margins. Accounting for this substantial but previously overlooked source of new N to marine systems necessitates revisions to global marine N budgets.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the Atlantic Ocean, nitrogen fixation rates have been shown to vary significantly depending on the region and season. A study in the Gulf Stream found elevated N2 fixation rates consistent with circular biogeochemical controls on diazotrophy, suggesting that the transport of phosphate and nitrate across the Gulf Stream may be crucial for maintaining steady nutrient stoichiometry in the subtropical gyre (1). Another study off the NW Iberian margin reported lower N2 fixation rates compared to subtropical regions, but highlighted the presence of diazotrophs year-round, with biogeochemical budgets proving a robust tool for identifying hotspots of marine diazotrophy (2). Research in the western North Atlantic revealed severe phosphate depletion, suggesting that iron supply could be a limiting factor forprimary production and subsequent N2 fixation, with diazotrophs present throughout the year despite lower nutrient availability (3). In the temperate northeast Atlantic, high N2 fixation rates were discovered, supporting a significant portion of daily primary production during the post-bloom period, with the presence of excess phosphorus indicating potential feedbacks on nitrogen cycling (4). Lastly, temperate coastal waters along the North American continental shelf were found to have significantly higher N2 fixation rates than previously thought, challenging the biogeochemical model and highlighting the importance of considering regional variations in nitrogen budgets (5). Together, these studies underscore the complexity of nitrogen fixation in the Atlantic and the need for more nuanced regional assessments to refine global nitrogen budgets.\n\n",

Parenteral nanoemulsions as promising carriers for brain delivery of risperidone: Design, characterization and in vivo pharmacokinetic evaluation\nThis paper describes design and evaluation of parenteral lecithin-based nanoemulsions intended for brain delivery of risperidone, a poorly water-soluble psychopharmacological drug. The nanoemulsions were prepared through cold/hot high pressure homogenization and characterized regarding droplet size, polydispersity, surface charge, morphology, drug-vehicle interactions, and physical stability. To estimate the simultaneous influence of nanoemulsion formulation and preparation parameters-co-emulsifier type, aqueous phase type, homogenization temperature-on the critical quality attributes of developed nanoemulsions, a general factorial experimental design was applied. From the established design space and stability data, promising risperidone-loaded nanoemulsions (mean size about 160 nm, size distribution  lt 0.15, zeta potential around -50 mV), containing sodium oleate in the aqueous phase and polysorbate 80, poloxamer 188 or Solutol (R) HS15 as co-emulsifier, were produced by hot homogenization and their ability to improve risperidone delivery to the brain was assessed in rats. Pharmacokinetic study demonstrated erratic brain profiles of risperidone following intraperitoneal administration in selected nanoemulsions, most probably due to their different droplet surface properties (different composition of the stabilizing layer). Namely, polysorbate 80-costabilized nanoemulsion showed increased (1.4-7.4-fold higher) risperidone brain availability compared to other nanoemulsions and drug solution, suggesting this nanoemulsion as a promising carrier worth exploring further for brain targeting\n\n2. Glycosylated Sertraline-Loaded Liposomes for Brain Targeting: QbD Study of Formulation Variabilities and Brain Transport\nEffectiveness of CNS-acting drugs depends on the localization, targeting, and capacity to be transported through the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) which can be achieved by designing brain-targeting delivery vectors. Hence, the objective of this study was to screen the formulation and process variables affecting the performance of sertraline (Ser-HCl)-loaded pegylated and glycosylated liposomes. The prepared vectors were characterized for Ser-HCl entrapment, size, surface charge, release behavior, and in vitro transport through the BBB. Furthermore, the compatibility among liposomal components was assessed using SEM, FTIR, and DSC analysis. Through a thorough screening study, enhancement of Ser-HCl entrapment, nanosized liposomes with low skewness, maximized stability, and controlled drug leakage were attained. The solid-state characterization revealed remarkable interaction between Ser-HCl and the charging agent to determine drug entrapment and leakage. Moreover, results of liposomal transport through mouse brain endothelialpolyoma cells demonstrated greater capacity of the proposed glycosylated liposomes to target the cerebellar due to its higher density of GLUT1 and higher glucose utilization. This transport capacity was confirmed by the inhibiting action of both cytochalasin B and phenobarbital. Using C6 glioma cells model, flow cytometry, time-lapse live cell imaging, and in vivo NIR fluorescence imaging demonstrated that optimized glycosylated liposomes can be transported through the BBB by classical endocytosis, as well as by specific transcytosis. In conclusion, the current study proposed a thorough screening of important formulation and process variabilities affecting brain-targeting liposomes for further scale-up processes.\n\n3. Vincristine and temozolomide combined chemotherapy for the treatment of glioma: a comparison of solid lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers for dual drugs delivery\nAbstract Context: Glioma is a common malignant brain tumor originating in the central nervous system. Efficient delivery of therapeutic agents to the cells and tissues is a difficult challenge. Co-delivery of anticancer drugs into the cancer cells or tissues by multifunctional nanocarriers may provide a new paradigm in cancer treatment. Objective: In this study, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) were constructed for co-delivery of vincristine (VCR) and temozolomide (TMZ) to develop the synergetic therapeutic action of the two drugs. The antitumor effects of these two systems were compared to provide a better choice for gliomatosis cerebri treatment. Methods: VCR- and TMZ-loaded SLNs (VT-SLNs) and NLCs (VT-NLCs) were formulated. Their particle size, zeta potential, drug encapsulation efficiency (EE) and drug loading capacity were evaluated. The single TMZ-loaded SLNs and NLCs were also prepared as contrast. Anti-tumor efficacies of the two kinds of carriers were evaluated on U87 malignant glioma cells and mice bearing malignant glioma model. Results: Significantly better glioma inhibition was observed on NLCs formulations than SLNs, and dual drugs displayed the highest antitumor efficacy in vivo and in vitro than all the other formulations used. Conclusion: VT-NLCs can deliver VCR and TMZ into U87MG cells more efficiently, and inhibition efficacy is higher than VT-SLNs. This dual drugs-loaded NLCs could be an outstanding drug delivery system to achieve excellent therapeutic efficiency for the treatment of malignant gliomatosis cerebri.\n\n4. Lactoferrin bioconjugated solid lipid nanoparticles: a new drug delivery system for potential brain targeting\nAbstract Background: Delivery of drugs to brain is a subtle task in the therapy of many severe neurological disorders. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) easily diffuse the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) due to their lipophilic nature. Furthermore, ligand conjugation on SLN surface enhances the targeting efficiency. Lactoferin (Lf) conjugated SLN system is first time attempted for effective brain targeting in this study. Purpose: Preparation of Lf-modified docetaxel (DTX)-loaded SLN for proficient delivery of DTX to brain. Methods: DTX-loaded SLN were prepared using emulsification and solvent evaporation method and conjugation of Lf on SLN surface (C-SLN) was attained through carbodiimide chemistry. These lipidic nanoparticles were evaluated by DLS, AFM, FTIR, XRD techniques and in vitro release studies. Colloidal stability study was performed in biologically simulated environment (normal saline and serum). These lipidic nanoparticles were further evaluated for its targeting mechanism for uptake in brain tumour cells and brain via receptor saturation studies and distribution studies in brain, respectively. Results: Particle size of lipidic nanoparticles was found to be optimum. Surface morphology (zeta potential, AFM) and surface chemistry (FTIR) confirmed conjugation of Lf on SLN surface. Cytotoxicity studies revealed augmented apoptotic activity of C-SLN than SLN and DTX. Enhanced cytotoxicity was demonstrated by receptor saturation and uptake studies. Brain concentration of DTX was elevated significantly with C-SLN than marketed formulation. Conclusions: It is evident from the cytotoxicity, uptake that SLN has potential to deliver drug to brain than marketed formulation but conjugating Lf on SLN surface (C-SLN) further increased the targeting potential for brain tumour. Moreover, brain distribution studies corroborated the use of C-SLN as a viable vehicle to target drug to brain. Hence, C-SLN was demonstrated to be a promising DTX delivery system to brain as it possessed remarkable biocompatibility, stability and efficacy than other reported delivery systems.\n\n5. Enhanced delivery of etoposide across the blood\u2013brain barrier to restrain brain tumor growth using melanotransferrin antibody- and tamoxifen-conjugated solid lipid nanoparticles\nAbstract Melanotransferrin antibody (MA) and tamoxifen (TX) were conjugated on etoposide (ETP)-entrapped solid lipid nanoparticles (ETP-SLNs) to target the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and glioblastom multiforme (GBM). MA- and TX-conjugated ETP-SLNs (MA\u2013TX\u2013ETP\u2013SLNs) were used to infiltrate the BBB comprising a monolayer of human astrocyte-regulated human brain-microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) and to restrain the proliferation of malignant U87MG cells. TX-grafted ETP-SLNs (TX\u2013ETP\u2013SLNs) significantly enhanced the BBB permeability coefficient for ETP and raised the fluorescent intensity of calcein-AM when compared with ETP-SLNs. In addition, surface MA could increase the BBB permeability coefficient for ETP about twofold. The viability of HBMECs was higher than 86%, suggesting a high biocompatibility of MA\u2013TX\u2013ETP-SLNs. Moreover, the efficiency in antiproliferation against U87MG cells was in the order of MA\u2013TX\u2013ETP-SLNs\u2009\u2009>\u2009\u2009TX\u2013ETP-SLNs\u2009\u2009>\u2009\u2009ETP-SLNs\u2009\u2009>\u2009\u2009SLNs. The capability of MA\u2013TX\u2013ETP-SLNs to target HBMECs and U87MG cells during internalization was verified by immunochemical staining of expressed melanotransferrin. MA\u2013TX\u2013ETP-SLNs can be a potent pharmacotherapy to deliver ETP across the BBB to GBM.\n\n###\n\n",

Parenteral nanoemulsions as promising carriers for brain delivery of risperidone: Design, characterization and in vivo pharmacokinetic evaluation\nThis paper describes design and evaluation of parenteral lecithin-based nanoemulsions intended for brain delivery of risperidone, a poorly water-soluble psychopharmacological drug. The nanoemulsions were prepared through cold/hot high pressure homogenization and characterized regarding droplet size, polydispersity, surface charge, morphology, drug-vehicle interactions, and physical stability. To estimate the simultaneous influence of nanoemulsion formulation and preparation parameters-co-emulsifier type, aqueous phase type, homogenization temperature-on the critical quality attributes of developed nanoemulsions, a general factorial experimental design was applied. From the established design space and stability data, promising risperidone-loaded nanoemulsions (mean size about 160 nm, size distribution  lt 0.15, zeta potential around -50 mV), containing sodium oleate in the aqueous phase and polysorbate 80, poloxamer 188 or Solutol (R) HS15 as co-emulsifier, were produced by hot homogenization and their ability to improve risperidone delivery to the brain was assessed in rats. Pharmacokinetic study demonstrated erratic brain profiles of risperidone following intraperitoneal administration in selected nanoemulsions, most probably due to their different droplet surface properties (different composition of the stabilizing layer). Namely, polysorbate 80-costabilized nanoemulsion showed increased (1.4-7.4-fold higher) risperidone brain availability compared to other nanoemulsions and drug solution, suggesting this nanoemulsion as a promising carrier worth exploring further for brain targeting\n\n2. Glycosylated Sertraline-Loaded Liposomes for Brain Targeting: QbD Study of Formulation Variabilities and Brain Transport\nEffectiveness of CNS-acting drugs depends on the localization, targeting, and capacity to be transported through the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) which can be achieved by designing brain-targeting delivery vectors. Hence, the objective of this study was to screen the formulation and process variables affecting the performance of sertraline (Ser-HCl)-loaded pegylated and glycosylated liposomes. The prepared vectors were characterized for Ser-HCl entrapment, size, surface charge, release behavior, and in vitro transport through the BBB. Furthermore, the compatibility among liposomal components was assessed using SEM, FTIR, and DSC analysis. Through a thorough screening study, enhancement of Ser-HCl entrapment, nanosized liposomes with low skewness, maximized stability, and controlled drug leakage were attained. The solid-state characterization revealed remarkable interaction between Ser-HCl and the charging agent to determine drug entrapment and leakage. Moreover, results of liposomal transport through mouse brain endothelialpolyoma cells demonstrated greater capacity of the proposed glycosylated liposomes to target the cerebellar due to its higher density of GLUT1 and higher glucose utilization. This transport capacity was confirmed by the inhibiting action of both cytochalasin B and phenobarbital. Using C6 glioma cells model, flow cytometry, time-lapse live cell imaging, and in vivo NIR fluorescence imaging demonstrated that optimized glycosylated liposomes can be transported through the BBB by classical endocytosis, as well as by specific transcytosis. In conclusion, the current study proposed a thorough screening of important formulation and process variabilities affecting brain-targeting liposomes for further scale-up processes.\n\n3. Vincristine and temozolomide combined chemotherapy for the treatment of glioma: a comparison of solid lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers for dual drugs delivery\nAbstract Context: Glioma is a common malignant brain tumor originating in the central nervous system. Efficient delivery of therapeutic agents to the cells and tissues is a difficult challenge. Co-delivery of anticancer drugs into the cancer cells or tissues by multifunctional nanocarriers may provide a new paradigm in cancer treatment. Objective: In this study, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) were constructed for co-delivery of vincristine (VCR) and temozolomide (TMZ) to develop the synergetic therapeutic action of the two drugs. The antitumor effects of these two systems were compared to provide a better choice for gliomatosis cerebri treatment. Methods: VCR- and TMZ-loaded SLNs (VT-SLNs) and NLCs (VT-NLCs) were formulated. Their particle size, zeta potential, drug encapsulation efficiency (EE) and drug loading capacity were evaluated. The single TMZ-loaded SLNs and NLCs were also prepared as contrast. Anti-tumor efficacies of the two kinds of carriers were evaluated on U87 malignant glioma cells and mice bearing malignant glioma model. Results: Significantly better glioma inhibition was observed on NLCs formulations than SLNs, and dual drugs displayed the highest antitumor efficacy in vivo and in vitro than all the other formulations used. Conclusion: VT-NLCs can deliver VCR and TMZ into U87MG cells more efficiently, and inhibition efficacy is higher than VT-SLNs. This dual drugs-loaded NLCs could be an outstanding drug delivery system to achieve excellent therapeutic efficiency for the treatment of malignant gliomatosis cerebri.\n\n4. Lactoferrin bioconjugated solid lipid nanoparticles: a new drug delivery system for potential brain targeting\nAbstract Background: Delivery of drugs to brain is a subtle task in the therapy of many severe neurological disorders. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) easily diffuse the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) due to their lipophilic nature. Furthermore, ligand conjugation on SLN surface enhances the targeting efficiency. Lactoferin (Lf) conjugated SLN system is first time attempted for effective brain targeting in this study. Purpose: Preparation of Lf-modified docetaxel (DTX)-loaded SLN for proficient delivery of DTX to brain. Methods: DTX-loaded SLN were prepared using emulsification and solvent evaporation method and conjugation of Lf on SLN surface (C-SLN) was attained through carbodiimide chemistry. These lipidic nanoparticles were evaluated by DLS, AFM, FTIR, XRD techniques and in vitro release studies. Colloidal stability study was performed in biologically simulated environment (normal saline and serum). These lipidic nanoparticles were further evaluated for its targeting mechanism for uptake in brain tumour cells and brain via receptor saturation studies and distribution studies in brain, respectively. Results: Particle size of lipidic nanoparticles was found to be optimum. Surface morphology (zeta potential, AFM) and surface chemistry (FTIR) confirmed conjugation of Lf on SLN surface. Cytotoxicity studies revealed augmented apoptotic activity of C-SLN than SLN and DTX. Enhanced cytotoxicity was demonstrated by receptor saturation and uptake studies. Brain concentration of DTX was elevated significantly with C-SLN than marketed formulation. Conclusions: It is evident from the cytotoxicity, uptake that SLN has potential to deliver drug to brain than marketed formulation but conjugating Lf on SLN surface (C-SLN) further increased the targeting potential for brain tumour. Moreover, brain distribution studies corroborated the use of C-SLN as a viable vehicle to target drug to brain. Hence, C-SLN was demonstrated to be a promising DTX delivery system to brain as it possessed remarkable biocompatibility, stability and efficacy than other reported delivery systems.\n\n5. Enhanced delivery of etoposide across the blood\u2013brain barrier to restrain brain tumor growth using melanotransferrin antibody- and tamoxifen-conjugated solid lipid nanoparticles\nAbstract Melanotransferrin antibody (MA) and tamoxifen (TX) were conjugated on etoposide (ETP)-entrapped solid lipid nanoparticles (ETP-SLNs) to target the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and glioblastom multiforme (GBM). MA- and TX-conjugated ETP-SLNs (MA\u2013TX\u2013ETP\u2013SLNs) were used to infiltrate the BBB comprising a monolayer of human astrocyte-regulated human brain-microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) and to restrain the proliferation of malignant U87MG cells. TX-grafted ETP-SLNs (TX\u2013ETP\u2013SLNs) significantly enhanced the BBB permeability coefficient for ETP and raised the fluorescent intensity of calcein-AM when compared with ETP-SLNs. In addition, surface MA could increase the BBB permeability coefficient for ETP about twofold. The viability of HBMECs was higher than 86%, suggesting a high biocompatibility of MA\u2013TX\u2013ETP-SLNs.

The capability of MA\u2013TX\u2013ETP-SLNs to target HBMECs and U87MG cells during internalization was verified by immunochemical staining of expressed melanotransferrin. MA\u2013TX\u2013ETP-SLNs can be a potent pharmacotherapy to deliver ETP across the BBB to GBM.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " Recent advancements in drug delivery systems have focused on enhancing the permeation of drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to treat various central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Parenteral nanoemulsions have shown promise for delivering risperidone to the CNS, with the choice of co-emulsifiers and homogenization temperatures playing a critical role in the drug delivery process (1). Similarly, liposomal systems have been engineered for sertraline, with the glycosylation of the liposomes enhancing their ability to target the CNS and overcome the BBB (2). Combination therapies using glycosylated liposomes have also been explored for the treatment of glioma, with the synergistic effects of vincristine and temozolomide demonstrating improved antitumor activity (3). Lactoferrin-conjugated solid lipid nanoparticles have been introduced as a novel drug delivery system, with their targeted delivery to brain tumor cells indicated by receptor saturation studies (4). Lastly, the use of melanotransferrin antibody- and tamoxifen-conjugated solid lipid nanoparticles has been shown to enhance the BBB permeability of etoposide and restrain the growth of malignant brain tumors (5). These studies collectively underscore the potential of nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems in improving the therapeutic efficacy of CNS drugs while minimizing their side effects. However, the complexity of the CNS environment and the tight junctional properties of the BBB remain major challenges that must be addressed in the development of effective drug delivery vehicles for CNS disorders.\n\n",

These lipidic nanoparticles were evaluated by DLS, AFM, FTIR, XRD techniques and in vitro release studies. Colloidal stability study was performed in biologically simulated environment (normal saline and serum). These lipidic nanoparticles were further evaluated for its targeting mechanism for uptake in brain tumour cells and brain via receptor saturation studies and distribution studies in brain, respectively. Results: Particle size of lipidic nanoparticles was found to be optimum. Surface morphology (zeta potential, AFM) and surface chemistry (FTIR) confirmed conjugation of Lf on SLN surface. Cytotoxicity studies revealed augmented apoptotic activity of C-SLN than SLN and DTX. Enhanced cytotoxicity was demonstrated by receptor saturation and uptake studies. Brain concentration of DTX was elevated significantly with C-SLN than marketed formulation. Conclusions: It is evident from the cytotoxicity, uptake that SLN has potential to deliver drug to brain than marketed formulation but conjugating Lf on SLN surface (C-SLN) further increased the targeting potential for brain tumour. Moreover, brain distribution studies corroborated the use of C-SLN as a viable vehicle to target drug to brain. Hence, C-SLN was demonstrated to be a promising DTX delivery system to brain as it possessed remarkable biocompatibility, stability and efficacy than other reported delivery systems.\n\n5. Enhanced delivery of etoposide across the blood\u2013brain barrier to restrain brain tumor growth using melanotransferrin antibody- and tamoxifen-conjugated solid lipid nanoparticles\nAbstract Melanotransferrin antibody (MA) and tamoxifen (TX) were conjugated on etoposide (ETP)-entrapped solid lipid nanoparticles (ETP-SLNs) to target the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and glioblastom multiforme (GBM). MA- and TX-conjugated ETP-SLNs (MA\u2013TX\u2013ETP\u2013SLNs) were used to infiltrate the BBB comprising a monolayer of human astrocyte-regulated human brain-microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) and to restrain the proliferation of malignant U87MG cells. TX-grafted ETP-SLNs (TX\u2013ETP\u2013SLNs) significantly enhanced the BBB permeability coefficient for ETP and raised the fluorescent intensity of calcein-AM when compared with ETP-SLNs. In addition, surface MA could increase the BBB permeability coefficient for ETP about twofold. The viability of HBMECs was higher than 86%, suggesting a high biocompatibility of MA\u2013TX\u2013ETP-SLNs. Moreover, the efficiency in antiproliferation against U87MG cells was in the order of MA\u2013TX\u2013ETP-SLNs\u2009\u2009>\u2009\u2009TX\u2013ETP-SLNs\u2009\u2009>\u2009\u2009ETP-SLNs\u2009\u2009>\u2009\u2009SLNs. The capability of MA\u2013TX\u2013ETP-SLNs to target HBMECs and U87MG cells during internalization was verified by immunochemical staining of expressed melanotransferrin. MA\u2013TX\u2013ETP-SLNs can be a potent pharmacotherapy to deliver ETP across the BBB to GBM.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In an ambitious study to enhance drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), Parenteral nanoemulsions were designed as carriers for risperidone, a psychopharmaceutical drug, using lecithin as a coemulsifier, demonstrating that the nanoemulsions could significantly improve risperidone brain availability, with the poloxamer 188-containing nanoemulsions outperforming others in terms of brain uptake, suggesting their potential for brain targeting (1). Similarly, Sertraline-loaded pegylated and glycosylated liposomes were evaluated for their ability to cross the BBB, with the study highlighting the importance of formulation and process variables in enhancing drug transport and suggesting that glycosylated liposomes could be a promising vector for cerebral drug delivery (2). The comparative study between solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) for the co-delivery of vincristine and temozolomide for glioma treatment revealed that the NLCs delivered the drugs more efficiently to glioma cells and mice, indicating their potential as therapeutic systems for brain tumors (3). Lactoferrin bioconjugated SLNs were prepared and evaluated for their effectiveness in delivering docetaxel to the brain, with the conjugated SLNs demonstrating enhanced cytotoxicity and uptake in brain tumor cells compared to unconjugated SLNs, suggesting their suitability as a drug delivery system for the brain (4). Lastly, the use of melanotransferrin antibody- and tamoxifen-conjugated solid lipid nanoparticles to enhance the delivery of etoposide across the BBB for the treatment of glioblastoma showed that the MA- and TX-conjugated nanoparticles significantly increased drug permeability and antiproliferative efficacy, with MA-MA-ETP-SLNs offering the highest therapeutic potential (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the diverse strategies being employed to overcome the formidable challenge of drug delivery across the BBB, with each approach contributing to the advancement of CNS drug delivery.",

        "inference": " The methodologies employed across the five Bio-entity recognition tasks at the BioNLP Shared Tasks 2016, 2013, 2011, and 2019 reveal a diverse approach to extracting and categorizing biological entities from scientific texts. The SeeDev Task at the 2016 edition focused on the extraction of genetic and molecular mechanisms during seed development, dealing with a wide range of entity types to reflect biological complexity, with metrics including F-scores to evaluate participant systems (1). Similarly, the Cancer Genetics (CG) task of 2013 aimed at recognizing events in text as structured n-ary associations, extending the extraction task to higher levels of biological organization and full-text scientific analysis on cancer, using Fscores to assess performance (2). The Genia Event Task of 2011 and 2013 continued this trend by focusing on bio-molecular events, with the latter task modified to evaluate generalization to full-text papers, employing metrics such as F1-scores to measure advancement in system performance (3, 4). Lastly, the CRAFT Shared Tasks 2019 integrated structure, semantics, and coreference, requiring the generation of dependency parses, the linking of coreferring noun phrases, and the identification of biomedical ontology concepts, utilizing evaluation metrics like D-coreF1 to measure performance across full-text biomedical articles (5).

Overview of the Regulatory Network of Plant Seed Development\n            (SeeDev) Task at the BioNLP Shared Task 2016.\nThis paper presents the SeeDev Task of the BioNLP Shared Task 2016. The purpose of the SeeDev Task is the extraction from scientific articles of the descriptions of genetic and molecular mechanisms involved in seed development of the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. The SeeDev task consists in the extraction of many different event types that involve a wide range of entity types so that they accurately reflect the complexity of the biological mechanisms. The corpus is composed of paragraphs selected from the full-texts of relevant scientific articles. In this paper, we describe the organization of the SeeDev task, the corpus characteristics, and the metrics used for the evaluation of participant systems. We analyze and discuss the final results of the seven participant systems to the test. The best F-score is 0.432, which is similar to the scores achieved in similar tasks on molecular biology.\n\n2. Overview of the Cancer Genetics (CG) task of BioNLP Shared Task 2013\nWe present the design, preparation, results and analysis of the Cancer Genetics (CG) event extraction task, a main task of the BioNLP Shared Task (ST) 2013. The CG task is an information extraction task targeting the recognition of events in text, represented as structured n-ary associations of given physical entities. In addition to addressing the cancer domain, the CG task is differentiated from previous event extraction tasks in the BioNLP ST series in addressing a wide range of pathological processes and multiple levels of biological organization, ranging from the molecular through the cellular and organ levels up to whole organisms. Final test set submissions were accepted from six teams. The highest-performing system achieved an Fscore of 55.4%. This level of performance is broadly comparable with the state of the art for established molecular-level extraction tasks, demonstrating that event extraction resources and methods generalize well to higher levels of biological organization and are applicable to the analysis of scientific texts on cancer. The CG task continues as an open challenge to all interested parties, with tools and resources available from http://2013. bionlp-st.org/.\n\n3. Overview of Genia Event Task in BioNLP Shared Task 2011\nThe Genia event task, a bio-molecular event extraction task, is arranged as one of the main tasks of BioNLP Shared Task 2011. As its second time to be arranged for community-wide focused efforts, it aimed to measure the advance of the community since 2009, and to evaluate generalization of the technology to full text papers. After a 3-month system development period, 15 teams submitted their performance results on test cases. The results show the community has made a significant advancement in terms of both performance improvement and generalization.\n\n4. The Genia Event Extraction Shared Task, 2013 Edition - Overview\nThe Genia Event Extraction task is organized for the third time, in BioNLP Shared Task 2013. Toward knowledge based construction, the task is modified in a number of points. As the final results, it received 12 submissions, among which 2 were withdrawn from the final report. This paper presents the task setting, data sets, and the final results with discussion for possible future directions.\n\n5. CRAFT Shared Tasks 2019 Overview \u2013- Integrated Structure, Semantics, and Coreference\nAs part of the BioNLP Open Shared Tasks 2019, the CRAFT Shared Tasks 2019 provides a platform to gauge the state of the art for three fundamental language processing tasks \u2014 dependency parse construction, coreference resolution, and ontology concept identification \u2014 over full-text biomedical articles. The structural annotation task requires the automatic generation of dependency parses for each sentence of an article given only the article text. The coreference resolution task focuses on linking coreferring base noun phrase mentions into chains using the symmetrical and transitive identity relation. The ontology concept annotation task involves the identification of concept mentions within text using the classes of ten distinct ontologies in the biomedical domain, both unmodified and augmented with extension classes. This paper provides an overview of each task, including descriptions of the data provided to participants and the evaluation metrics used, and discusses participant results relative to baseline performances for each of the three tasks.\n\n###\n\n",

X-ray flares of the young planet host Ds Tucanae A\nThe discovery of planets around young stars has spurred novel studies of the early phases of planetary formation and evolution. Stars are strong emitters at X-ray and UV wavelengths in their first billion of years and this strongly affects the evaporation, thermodynamics, and chemistry in the atmospheres of the young planets orbiting around them. In order to investigate these effects in young exoplanets, we observed the 40 Myr old star DS Tuc A with XMM-Newton. We recorded two X-ray bright flares, with the second event occurring about 12 ks after the first one. Their duration, from the rise to the end of the decay, was about 8\u2005\u2212\u200510 ks in soft X-rays (0.3\u201310 keV). The flares were also recorded in the 200\u2013300 nm band with the UVM2 filter of the Optical Monitor. The duration of the flares in UV was about 3 ks. The observed delay between the peak in the UV band and in X-rays is a probe of the heating phase, followed by evaporation and an increase in the density and emission of the flaring loop. The coronal plasma temperature at the two flare peaks reached 54\u201355 MK. Diagnostics based on the temperatures and timescales of the flares applied to these two events have allowed us to infer a loop length of 5\u2005\u2212\u20057\u2005\u00d7\u20051010 cm, which is about the extent of the stellar radius. We also inferred the values of electron density at the flare peaks of 2.3\u2005\u2212\u20056.5\u2005\u00d7\u20051011 cm\u22123, along with a minimum magnetic field strength on the order of 300\u2013500 G that is needed to confine the plasma. The energy released during the flares was on the order of 5\u2005\u2212\u20058\u2005\u00d7\u20051034 erg in the bands 0.3\u2005\u2212\u200510 keV and 0.9\u2005\u2212\u20052.7\u2005\u00d7\u20051033 erg in the UV band (200\u2013300 nm). We speculate that the flares were associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that hit the planet about 3.3 h after the flares, which dramatically increased the rate of evaporation for the planet. From the RGS spectra, we retrieved the emission measure distribution and the abundances of coronal metals during the quiescent and flaring states, respectively. Finally, we inferred a high electron density measurement, which is in agreement with the inferences drawn from time-resolved spectroscopy and EPIC spectra, as well as the analysis of RGS spectra during the flares.\n\n2. Simultaneous Kepler/K2 and XMM-Newton observations of superflares in the Pleiades\nContext. Flares are powerful events ignited by a sudden release of magnetic energy which triggers a cascade of interconnected phenomena, each resulting in emission in different electromagnetic bands. In fact, in the Sun flares are observed across the whole electromagnetic spectrum. Multi-band observations of stellar flares are instead rare. This limits our ability to extend what we learn from solar flares to the case of flares occurring in stars with different properties. Aims. With the aim of studying flares in the 125-Myr-old stars in the Pleiades observed simultaneously in optical and X-ray light, we obtained new XMM-Newton observations of this cluster during the observations of Kepler K2 Campaign 4. The objective of this paper is to characterize the most powerful flares observed in both bands and to constrain the energy released in the optical and X-ray, the geometry of the loops, and their time evolution. We also aim to compare our results to existing studies of flares occurring in the Sun and stars at different ages. Methods. We selected bright X-ray/optical flares that occurred in 12 known members of the Pleiades from their K2 and XMM-Newton light curves. The sample includes ten K-M stars, one F9 star, and one G8 star. Flare average properties were obtained from integrated analysis of the light curves during the flares. The time evolution of the plasma in the magnetic loops is constrained with time-resolved X-ray spectral analysis. Results. Most of the flares studied in this work emitted more energy in optical than in X-rays, as in most solar flares, even if the Pleiades flares output a larger fraction of their total energy in X-rays than typical solar flares do. Additionally, the energy budget in the two bands is weakly correlated. We also found comparable flare duration in optical and X-rays and observed that rapidly rotating stars (e.g., with rotation period shorter than 0.5 days) preferentially host short flares. We estimated the slope of the cooling path of the flares in the log(EM)-vs.-log(T) plane. The values we obtained are affected by large uncertainties, but their nominal values suggest that the flares analyzed in this paper are mainly due to single loops with no sustained heating occurring during the cooling phase. We also observed and analyzed oscillations with a period of 500\u2006s during one of the flares. Conclusions. The flares observed in the Pleiades can be classified as \u201csuperflares\u201d based on their energy budget in the optical, and share some of the properties of the flares observed in the Sun, despite being more energetic. For instance, as in most solar flares, more energy is typically released in the optical than in X-rays and the duration of the flares in the two bands is correlated. We have attempted a comparison between the X-ray flares observed in the Pleiades and those observed in clusters with different ages, but to firmly address any evolutionary pattern of flare characteristics, similar and uniform multi-wavelength analyses on more complete samples are necessary.\n\n3. X-Ray Spectroscopy in the Microcalorimeter Era. III. Line Formation under Case A, Case B, Case C, and Case D in H- and He-like Iron for a Photoionized Cloud\nAbstract Future microcalorimeter X-ray observations will resolve spectral features in unmatched detail. Understanding of line formation processes in X-rays deserves much attention. The purpose of this paper is to discuss such processes in the presence of a photoionizing source. Line formation processes in one- and two-electron species are broadly categorized into four cases. Case A occurs when the Lyman line optical depths are very small and photoexcitation does not occur. Line photons escape the cloud without any scattering. Case B occurs when the Lyman line optical depths are large enough for photons to undergo multiple scatterings. Case C occurs when a broadband continuum source strikes an optically thin cloud. The Lyman lines are enhanced by induced radiative excitation of the atoms/ions by continuum photons, also known as continuum pumping. A fourth, less studied scenario, where the Case B spectrum is enhanced by continuum pumping, is called Case D. Here, we establish the mathematical foundation of Cases A, B, C, and D in an irradiated cloud with Cloudy. We also show the total X-ray emission spectrum for all four cases within the energy range 0.1\u201310 keV at the resolving power of XRISM around 6 keV. Additionally, we show that the combined effect of electron scattering and partial blockage of continuum pumping reduces the resonance line intensities. Such reduction increases with column density and can serve as an important tool to measure the column density/optical depth of the cloud.\n\n4. The Density of Coronal Plasma in Active Stellar Coronae\nWe have analyzed high-resolution X-ray spectra of a sample of 22 active stars observed with the High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer on Chandra in order to investigate their coronal plasma density. Densities were investigated using the lines of the He-like ions O VII, Mg XI, and Si XIII. Si XIII lines in all stars of the sample are compatible with the low-density limit (i.e., ne \u2272 1013 cm-3), casting some doubt on results based on lower resolution Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) spectra finding densities ne > 1013 cm-3. Mg XI lines betray the presence of high plasma densities up to a few times 1012 cm-3 for most of the sources with higher X-ray luminosity (\u22731030 ergs s-1); stars with higher LX and LX/Lbol tend to have higher densities at high temperatures. Ratios of O VII lines yield much lower densities of a few times 1010 cm-3, indicating that the \"hot\" and \"cool\" plasma resides in physically different structures. In the cases of EV Lac, HD 223460, Canopus, \u03bc Vel, TY Pyx, and IM Peg, our results represent the first spectroscopic estimates of coronal density. No trends in density-sensitive line ratios with stellar parameters effective temperature and surface gravity were found, indicating that plasma densities are remarkably similar for stars with pressure scale heights differing by up to 3 orders of magnitude. Our findings imply remarkably compact coronal structures, especially for the hotter (~7 MK) plasma emitting the Mg XI lines characterized by the coronal surface filling factor, f, ranging from 10-4 to 10-1, while we find f values from a few times 10-3 up to ~1 for the cooler (~2 MK) plasma emitting the O VII lines. We find that f approaches unity at the same stellar surface X-ray flux level as characterizes solar active regions, suggesting that these stars become completely covered by active regions. At the same surface flux level, f is seen to increase more sharply with increasing surface flux. These results appear to support earlier suggestions that hot 107 K plasma in active coronae arises from flaring activity and that this flaring activity increases markedly once the stellar surface becomes covered with active regions. Comparison of our measured line fluxes with theoretical models suggests that significant residual model inaccuracies might be present and, in particular, that cascade contributions to forbidden and intercombination lines resulting from dielectronic recombination might be to blame.\n\n5. Optical and X-ray observations of stellar flares on an active M dwarf AD\u00a0Leonis with the Seimei Telescope, SCAT, NICER, and OISTER\nAbstractWe report on multi-wavelength monitoring observations of an M-dwarf flare star AD\u00a0Leonis with the Seimei Telescope (6150\u20137930\u2009\u00c5), SCAT (Spectroscopic Chuo-university Astronomical Telescope; 3700\u20137500\u2009\u00c5), and NICER (Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer; 0.2\u201312.0\u2009keV), with the collaboration of the OISTER (Optical and Infrared Synergetic Telescopes for Education and Research) program. Twelve flares are detected in total, including ten H\u03b1, four X-ray, and four optical-continuum flares; one of them is a superflare with a total energy of \u223c2.0 \u00d7 1033\u2009erg. We found that: (1)\u00a0during the superflare, the H\u03b1 emission line full width at 1/8 maximum dramatically increases to 14\u2009\u00c5 from 8\u2009\u00c5 in the low-resolution spectra (R \u223c 2000) accompanied by large white-light flares, (2)\u00a0some weak H\u03b1/X-ray flares are not accompanied by white-light emissions, and (3)\u00a0the non-flaring emissions show clear rotational modulations in X-ray and H\u03b1 intensity in the same phase. To understand these observational features, one-dimensional hydrodynamic flare simulations are performed using the RADYN code. We find the simulated H\u03b1 line profiles with hard and high-energy non-thermal electron beams to be consistent with the initial phase line profiles of the superflares, while those with a softer and/or weak-energy beam are consistent with those in decay phases, indicating the changes in the energy fluxes injected to the lower atmosphere. Also, we find that the relation between the optical continuum and H\u03b1 intensity is nonlinear, which can be one cause of the non-white-light flares. The flare energy budget exhibits diversity in the observations and models, and more observations of stellar flares are necessary for constraining the occurrence of various emission line phenomena in stellar flares.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of X-ray astronomy for stars, methodologies have been developed to investigate the physical conditions and energetics of stellar coronae and the study of stellar flares. XMM-Newton was used to observe the young planet host Ds Tucanae A, detecting two X-ray flares with a focus on the coronal plasma temperature, electron density, and energy release during these events, which were inferred to be associated with coronal mass ejections (1). Similarly, the Kepler/K2 and XMM-Newton combinations were employed on the Pleiades cluster, selecting bright X-ray/optical flares and applying spectral analysis to constrain the plasma temperature evolution and time evolution of loops in the stellar coronae (2). The high-resolution spectroscopy capabilities of the High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer on Chandra were utilized to analyze a sample of active stars, focusing on the density of coronal plasma using He-like ions O VII, Mg XI, and Si XIII, which helped distinguish between different scenarios of X-ray emission from photoionized clouds (3). The Seimei Telescope, SCAT, NICER, and OISTER collaborated to monitor an M-dwarf flare star AD Leonis, detecting various types of flares and employing hydrodynamic flare simulations to understand the changes in energy fluxes within stellar atmospheres during flares (5). These methodologies collectively enhance our understanding of stellar X-ray emissions, coronal plasma properties, and the dynamics of stellar flares, each contributing to the broader knowledge of stellar astronomy through the application of advanced observational and theoretical techniques.\n\n",

X-ray flares of the young planet host Ds Tucanae A\nThe discovery of planets around young stars has spurred novel studies of the early phases of planetary formation and evolution. Stars are strong emitters at X-ray and UV wavelengths in their first billion of years and this strongly affects the evaporation, thermodynamics, and chemistry in the atmospheres of the young planets orbiting around them. In order to investigate these effects in young exoplanets, we observed the 40 Myr old star DS Tuc A with XMM-Newton. We recorded two X-ray bright flares, with the second event occurring about 12 ks after the first one. Their duration, from the rise to the end of the decay, was about 8\u2005\u2212\u200510 ks in soft X-rays (0.3\u201310 keV). The flares were also recorded in the 200\u2013300 nm band with the UVM2 filter of the Optical Monitor. The duration of the flares in UV was about 3 ks. The observed delay between the peak in the UV band and in X-rays is a probe of the heating phase, followed by evaporation and an increase in the density and emission of the flaring loop. The coronal plasma temperature at the two flare peaks reached 54\u201355 MK. Diagnostics based on the temperatures and timescales of the flares applied to these two events have allowed us to infer a loop length of 5\u2005\u2212\u20057\u2005\u00d7\u20051010 cm, which is about the extent of the stellar radius. We also inferred the values of electron density at the flare peaks of 2.3\u2005\u2212\u20056.5\u2005\u00d7\u20051011 cm\u22123, along with a minimum magnetic field strength on the order of 300\u2013500 G that is needed to confine the plasma. The energy released during the flares was on the order of 5\u2005\u2212\u20058\u2005\u00d7\u20051034 erg in the bands 0.3\u2005\u2212\u200510 keV and 0.9\u2005\u2212\u20052.7\u2005\u00d7\u20051033 erg in the UV band (200\u2013300 nm). We speculate that the flares were associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that hit the planet about 3.3 h after the flares, which dramatically increased the rate of evaporation for the planet. From the RGS spectra, we retrieved the emission measure distribution and the abundances of coronal metals during the quiescent and flaring states, respectively. Finally, we inferred a high electron density measurement, which is in agreement with the inferences drawn from time-resolved spectroscopy and EPIC spectra, as well as the analysis of RGS spectra during the flares.\n\n2. Simultaneous Kepler/K2 and XMM-Newton observations of superflares in the Pleiades\nContext. Flares are powerful events ignited by a sudden release of magnetic energy which triggers a cascade of interconnected phenomena, each resulting in emission in different electromagnetic bands. In fact, in the Sun flares are observed across the whole electromagnetic spectrum. Multi-band observations of stellar flares are instead rare. This limits our ability to extend what we learn from solar flares to the case of flares occurring in stars with different properties. Aims. With the aim of studying flares in the 125-Myr-old stars in the Pleiades observed simultaneously in optical and X-ray light, we obtained new XMM-Newton observations of this cluster during the observations of Kepler K2 Campaign 4. The objective of this paper is to characterize the most powerful flares observed in both bands and to constrain the energy released in the optical and X-ray, the geometry of the loops, and their time evolution. We also aim to compare our results to existing studies of flares occurring in the Sun and stars at different ages. Methods. We selected bright X-ray/optical flares that occurred in 12 known members of the Pleiades from their K2 and XMM-Newton light curves. The sample includes ten K-M stars, one F9 star, and one G8 star. Flare average properties were obtained from integrated analysis of the light curves during the flares. The time evolution of the plasma in the magnetic loops is constrained with time-resolved X-ray spectral analysis. Results. Most of the flares studied in this work emitted more energy in optical than in X-rays, as in most solar flares, even if the Pleiades flares output a larger fraction of their total energy in X-rays than typical solar flares do. Additionally, the energy budget in the two bands is weakly correlated. We also found comparable flare duration in optical and X-rays and observed that rapidly rotating stars (e.g., with rotation period shorter than 0.5 days) preferentially host short flares. We estimated the slope of the cooling path of the flares in the log(EM)-vs.-log(T) plane. The values we obtained are affected by large uncertainties, but their nominal values suggest that the flares analyzed in this paper are mainly due to single loops with no sustained heating occurring during the cooling phase. We also observed and analyzed oscillations with a period of 500\u2006s during one of the flares. Conclusions. The flares observed in the Pleiades can be classified as \u201csuperflares\u201d based on their energy budget in the optical, and share some of the properties of the flares observed in the Sun, despite being more energetic. For instance, as in most solar flares, more energy is typically released in the optical than in X-rays and the duration of the flares in the two bands is correlated. We have attempted a comparison between the X-ray flares observed in the Pleiades and those observed in clusters with different ages, but to firmly address any evolutionary pattern of flare characteristics, similar and uniform multi-wavelength analyses on more complete samples are necessary.\n\n3. X-Ray Spectroscopy in the Microcalorimeter Era. III. Line Formation under Case A, Case B, Case C, and Case D in H- and He-like Iron for a Photoionized Cloud\nAbstract Future microcalorimeter X-ray observations will resolve spectral features in unmatched detail. Understanding of line formation processes in X-rays deserves much attention. The purpose of this paper is to discuss such processes in the presence of a photoionizing source. Line formation processes in one- and two-electron species are broadly categorized into four cases. Case A occurs when the Lyman line optical depths are very small and photoexcitation does not occur. Line photons escape the cloud without any scattering. Case B occurs when the Lyman line optical depths are large enough for photons to undergo multiple scatterings. Case C occurs when a broadband continuum source strikes an optically thin cloud. The Lyman lines are enhanced by induced radiative excitation of the atoms/ions by continuum photons, also known as continuum pumping. A fourth, less studied scenario, where the Case B spectrum is enhanced by continuum pumping, is called Case D. Here, we establish the mathematical foundation of Cases A, B, C, and D in an irradiated cloud with Cloudy. We also show the total X-ray emission spectrum for all four cases within the energy range 0.1\u201310 keV at the resolving power of XRISM around 6 keV. Additionally, we show that the combined effect of electron scattering and partial blockage of continuum pumping reduces the resonance line intensities. Such reduction increases with column density and can serve as an important tool to measure the column density/optical depth of the cloud.\n\n4. The Density of Coronal Plasma in Active Stellar Coronae\nWe have analyzed high-resolution X-ray spectra of a sample of 22 active stars observed with the High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer on Chandra in order to investigate their coronal plasma density. Densities were investigated using the lines of the He-like ions O VII, Mg XI, and Si XIII. Si XIII lines in all stars of the sample are compatible with the low-density limit (i.e., ne \u2272 1013 cm-3), casting some doubt on results based on lower resolution Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) spectra finding densities ne > 1013 cm-3. Mg XI lines betray the presence of high plasma densities up to a few times 1012 cm-3 for most of the sources with higher X-ray luminosity (\u22731030 ergs s-1); stars with higher LX and LX/Lbol tend to have higher densities at high temperatures. Ratios of O VII lines yield much lower densities of a few times 1010 cm-3, indicating that the \"hot\" and \"cool\" plasma resides in physically different structures. In the cases of EV Lac, HD 223460, Canopus, \u03bc Vel, TY Pyx, and IM Peg, our results represent the first spectroscopic estimates of coronal density. No trends in density-sensitive line ratios with stellar parameters effective temperature and surface gravity were found, indicating that plasma densities are remarkably similar for stars with pressure scale heights differing by up to 3 orders of magnitude. Our findings imply remarkably compact coronal structures, especially for the hotter (~7 MK) plasma emitting the Mg XI lines characterized by the coronal surface filling factor, f, ranging from 10-4 to 10-1, while we find f values from a few times 10-3 up to ~1 for the cooler (~2 MK) plasma emitting the O VII lines. We find that f approaches unity at the same stellar surface X-ray flux level as characterizes solar active regions, suggesting that these stars become completely covered by active regions. At the same surface flux level, f is seen to increase more sharply with increasing surface flux. These results appear to support earlier suggestions that hot 107 K plasma in active coronae arises from flaring activity and that this flaring activity increases markedly once the stellar surface becomes covered with active regions. Comparison of our measured line fluxes with theoretical models suggests that significant residual model inaccuracies might be present and, in particular, that cascade contributions to forbidden and intercombination lines resulting from dielectronic recombination might be to blame.\n\n5. Optical and X-ray observations of stellar flares on an active M dwarf AD\u00a0Leonis with the Seimei Telescope, SCAT, NICER, and OISTER\nAbstractWe report on multi-wavelength monitoring observations of an M-dwarf flare star AD\u00a0Leonis with the Seimei Telescope (6150\u20137930\u2009\u00c5), SCAT (Spectroscopic Chuo-university Astronomical Telescope; 3700\u20137500\u2009\u00c5), and NICER (Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer; 0.2\u201312.0\u2009keV), with the collaboration of the OISTER (Optical and Infrared Synergetic Telescopes for Education and Research) program. Twelve flares are detected in total, including ten H\u03b1, four X-ray, and four optical-continuum flares; one of them is a superflare with a total energy of \u223c2.0 \u00d7 1033\u2009erg. We found that: (1)\u00a0during the superflare, the H\u03b1 emission line full width at 1/8 maximum dramatically increases to 14\u2009\u00c5 from 8\u2009\u00c5 in the low-resolution spectra (R \u223c 2000) accompanied by large white-light flares, (2)\u00a0some weak H\u03b1/X-ray flares are not accompanied by white-light emissions, and (3)\u00a0the non-flaring emissions show clear rotational modulations in X-ray and H\u03b1 intensity in the same phase. To understand these observational features, one-dimensional hydrodynamic flare simulations are performed using the RADYN code. We find the simulated H\u03b1 line profiles with hard and high-energy non-thermal electron beams to be consistent with the initial phase line profiles of the superflares, while those with a softer and/or weak-energy beam are consistent with those in decay phases, indicating the changes in the energy fluxes injected to the lower atmosphere. Also, we find that the relation between the optical continuum and H\u03b1 intensity is nonlinear, which can be one cause of the non-white-light flares. The flare energy budget exhibits diversity in the observations and models, and more observations of stellar flares are necessary for constraining the occurrence of various emission line phenomena in stellar flares.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " Recent X-ray astronomy findings have shed light on the dynamic and energetically complex nature of stellar astrophysics, particularly in the context of stellar flares and coronal plasma. Observations of young exoplanet host stars, such as DS Tuc A, have revealed the profound influence of X-ray and UV emissions from young stellar coronae, which are crucial for planetary formation and evolution studies (1). These findings are echoed by studies of superflares in the Pleiades cluster, where the energy release and temporal characteristics of flares suggest similarities with solar flares, yet with a higher fraction of optical energy and a higher correlation between flare duration in different bands (2). The exploration of line formation in X-rays, particularly in H- and He-like ions, has furthermore, uncovered complex processes that can alter the spectral characteristics of X-ray sources, depending on the presence of Lyman line optical depths and continuum pumping effects (3). Investigations into the density of coronal plasma in active stellar coronae have shown that the dynamics of plasma heating and the structure of coronal loops can vary significantly among stars, with implications for the development of compact and structures with varying surface filling factors (4). Moreover, the multi-wavelength monitoring of stellar flares on an active M dwarf has demonstrated the complexity of flare phenomena, with variations in energy output, the absence of white-light flares in some cases, and the existence of rotational modulation in flare and non-flaring emissions, suggesting the involvement of non-thermal electron beams and rotational effects in stellar flare dynamics (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the intricate interplay of plasma physics, astrophysical phenomena, and observational data in the burgeoning field of X-ray astronomy applied to the study of stellar systems.\n\n",

X-ray flares of the young planet host Ds Tucanae A\nThe discovery of planets around young stars has spurred novel studies of the early phases of planetary formation and evolution. Stars are strong emitters at X-ray and UV wavelengths in their first billion of years and this strongly affects the evaporation, thermodynamics, and chemistry in the atmospheres of the young planets orbiting around them. In order to investigate these effects in young exoplanets, we observed the 40 Myr old star DS Tuc A with XMM-Newton. We recorded two X-ray bright flares, with the second event occurring about 12 ks after the first one. Their duration, from the rise to the end of the decay, was about 8\u2005\u2212\u200510 ks in soft X-rays (0.3\u201310 keV). The flares were also recorded in the 200\u2013300 nm band with the UVM2 filter of the Optical Monitor. The duration of the flares in UV was about 3 ks. The observed delay between the peak in the UV band and in X-rays is a probe of the heating phase, followed by evaporation and an increase in the density and emission of the flaring loop. The coronal plasma temperature at the two flare peaks reached 54\u201355 MK. Diagnostics based on the temperatures and timescales of the flares applied to these two events have allowed us to infer a loop length of 5\u2005\u2212\u20057\u2005\u00d7\u20051010 cm, which is about the extent of the stellar radius. We also inferred the values of electron density at the flare peaks of 2.3\u2005\u2212\u20056.5\u2005\u00d7\u20051011 cm\u22123, along with a minimum magnetic field strength on the order of 300\u2013500 G that is needed to confine the plasma. The energy released during the flares was on the order of 5\u2005\u2212\u20058\u2005\u00d7\u20051034 erg in the bands 0.3\u2005\u2212\u200510 keV and 0.9\u2005\u2212\u20052.7\u2005\u00d7\u20051033 erg in the UV band (200\u2013300 nm). We speculate that the flares were associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that hit the planet about 3.3 h after the flares, which dramatically increased the rate of evaporation for the planet. From the RGS spectra, we retrieved the emission measure distribution and the abundances of coronal metals during the quiescent and flaring states, respectively. Finally, we inferred a high electron density measurement, which is in agreement with the inferences drawn from time-resolved spectroscopy and EPIC spectra, as well as the analysis of RGS spectra during the flares.\n\n2. Simultaneous Kepler/K2 and XMM-Newton observations of superflares in the Pleiades\nContext. Flares are powerful events ignited by a sudden release of magnetic energy which triggers a cascade of interconnected phenomena, each resulting in emission in different electromagnetic bands. In fact, in the Sun flares are observed across the whole electromagnetic spectrum. Multi-band observations of stellar flares are instead rare. This limits our ability to extend what we learn from solar flares to the case of flares occurring in stars with different properties. Aims. With the aim of studying flares in the 125-Myr-old stars in the Pleiades observed simultaneously in optical and X-ray light, we obtained new XMM-Newton observations of this cluster during the observations of Kepler K2 Campaign 4. The objective of this paper is to characterize the most powerful flares observed in both bands and to constrain the energy released in the optical and X-ray, the geometry of the loops, and their time evolution. We also aim to compare our results to existing studies of flares occurring in the Sun and stars at different ages. Methods. We selected bright X-ray/optical flares that occurred in 12 known members of the Pleiades from their K2 and XMM-Newton light curves. The sample includes ten K-M stars, one F9 star, and one G8 star. Flare average properties were obtained from integrated analysis of the light curves during the flares. The time evolution of the plasma in the magnetic loops is constrained with time-resolved X-ray spectral analysis. Results. Most of the flares studied in this work emitted more energy in optical than in X-rays, as in most solar flares, even if the Pleiades flares output a larger fraction of their total energy in X-rays than typical solar flares do. Additionally, the energy budget in the two bands is weakly correlated. We also found comparable flare duration in optical and X-rays and observed that rapidly rotating stars (e.g., with rotation period shorter than 0.5 days) preferentially host short flares. We estimated the slope of the cooling path of the flares in the log(EM)-vs.-log(T) plane. The values we obtained are affected by large uncertainties, but their nominal values suggest that the flares analyzed in this paper are mainly due to single loops with no sustained heating occurring during the cooling phase. We also observed and analyzed oscillations with a period of 500\u2006s during one of the flares. Conclusions. The flares observed in the Pleiades can be classified as \u201csuperflares\u201d based on their energy budget in the optical, and share some of the properties of the flares observed in the Sun, despite being more energetic. For instance, as in most solar flares, more energy is typically released in the optical than in X-rays and the duration of the flares in the two bands is correlated. We have attempted a comparison between the X-ray flares observed in the Pleiades and those observed in clusters with different ages, but to firmly address any evolutionary pattern of flare characteristics, similar and uniform multi-wavelength analyses on more complete samples are necessary.\n\n3. X-Ray Spectroscopy in the Microcalorimeter Era. III. Line Formation under Case A, Case B, Case C, and Case D in H- and He-like Iron for a Photoionized Cloud\nAbstract Future microcalorimeter X-ray observations will resolve spectral features in unmatched detail. Understanding of line formation processes in X-rays deserves much attention. The purpose of this paper is to discuss such processes in the presence of a photoionizing source. Line formation processes in one- and two-electron species are broadly categorized into four cases. Case A occurs when the Lyman line optical depths are very small and photoexcitation does not occur. Line photons escape the cloud without any scattering. Case B occurs when the Lyman line optical depths are large enough for photons to undergo multiple scatterings. Case C occurs when a broadband continuum source strikes an optically thin cloud. The Lyman lines are enhanced by induced radiative excitation of the atoms/ions by continuum photons, also known as continuum pumping. A fourth, less studied scenario, where the Case B spectrum is enhanced by continuum pumping, is called Case D. Here, we establish the mathematical foundation of Cases A, B, C, and D in an irradiated cloud with Cloudy. We also show the total X-ray emission spectrum for all four cases within the energy range 0.1\u201310 keV at the resolving power of XRISM around 6 keV. Additionally, we show that the combined effect of electron scattering and partial blockage of continuum pumping reduces the resonance line intensities. Such reduction increases with column density and can serve as an important tool to measure the column density/optical depth of the cloud.\n\n4. The Density of Coronal Plasma in Active Stellar Coronae\nWe have analyzed high-resolution X-ray spectra of a sample of 22 active stars observed with the High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer on Chandra in order to investigate their coronal plasma density. Densities were investigated using the lines of the He-like ions O VII, Mg XI, and Si XIII. Si XIII lines in all stars of the sample are compatible with the low-density limit (i.e., ne \u2272 1013 cm-3), casting some doubt on results based on lower resolution Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) spectra finding densities ne > 1013 cm-3. Mg XI lines betray the presence of high plasma densities up to a few times 1012 cm-3 for most of the sources with higher X-ray luminosity (\u22731030 ergs s-1); stars with higher LX and LX/Lbol tend to have higher densities at high temperatures. Ratios of O VII lines yield much lower densities of a few times 1010 cm-3, indicating that the \"hot\" and \"cool\" plasma resides in physically different structures. In the cases of EV Lac, HD 223460, Canopus, \u03bc Vel, TY Pyx, and IM Peg, our results represent the first spectroscopic estimates of coronal density. No trends in density-sensitive line ratios with stellar parameters effective temperature and surface gravity were found, indicating that plasma densities are remarkably similar for stars with pressure scale heights differing by up to 3 orders of magnitude. Our findings imply remarkably compact coronal structures, especially for the hotter (~7 MK) plasma emitting the Mg XI lines characterized by the coronal surface filling factor, f, ranging from 10-4 to 10-1, while we find f values from a few times 10-3 up to ~1 for the cooler (~2 MK) plasma emitting the O VII lines. We find that f approaches unity at the same stellar surface X-ray flux level as characterizes solar active regions, suggesting that these stars become completely covered by active regions. At the same surface flux level, f is seen to increase more sharply with increasing surface flux. These results appear to support earlier suggestions that hot 107 K plasma in active coronae arises from flaring activity and that this flaring activity increases markedly once the stellar surface becomes covered with active regions. Comparison of our measured line fluxes with theoretical models suggests that significant residual model inaccuracies might be present and, in particular, that cascade contributions to forbidden and intercombination lines resulting from dielectronic recombination might be to blame.\n\n5. Optical and X-ray observations of stellar flares on an active M dwarf AD\u00a0Leonis with the Seimei Telescope, SCAT, NICER, and OISTER\nAbstractWe report on multi-wavelength monitoring observations of an M-dwarf flare star AD\u00a0Leonis with the Seimei Telescope (6150\u20137930\u2009\u00c5), SCAT (Spectroscopic Chuo-university Astronomical Telescope; 3700\u20137500\u2009\u00c5), and NICER (Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer; 0.2\u201312.0\u2009keV), with the collaboration of the OISTER (Optical and Infrared Synergetic Telescopes for Education and Research) program. Twelve flares are detected in total, including ten H\u03b1, four X-ray, and four optical-continuum flares; one of them is a superflare with a total energy of \u223c2.0 \u00d7 1033\u2009erg. We found that: (1)\u00a0during the superflare, the H\u03b1 emission line full width at 1/8 maximum dramatically increases to 14\u2009\u00c5 from 8\u2009\u00c5 in the low-resolution spectra (R \u223c 2000) accompanied by large white-light flares, (2)\u00a0some weak H\u03b1/X-ray flares are not accompanied by white-light emissions, and (3)\u00a0the non-flaring emissions show clear rotational modulations in X-ray and H\u03b1 intensity in the same phase. To understand these observational features, one-dimensional hydrodynamic flare simulations are performed using the RADYN code. We find the simulated H\u03b1 line profiles with hard and high-energy non-thermal electron beams to be consistent with the initial phase line profiles of the superflares, while those with a softer and/or weak-energy beam are consistent with those in decay phases, indicating the changes in the energy fluxes injected to the lower atmosphere. Also, we find that the relation between the optical continuum and H\u03b1 intensity is nonlinear, which can be one cause of the non-white-light flares. The flare energy budget exhibits diversity in the observations and models, and more observations of stellar flares are necessary for constraining the occurrence of various emission line phenomena in stellar flares.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In a series of studies, astronomers have shed light on the X-ray astronomy of stars, revealing fascinating insights into stellar flares and coronal plasma. The discovery of X-ray flares in the young planet host Ds Tucanae A provided a unique opportunity to study the heating and evaporation processes in the atmospheres of young exoplanets, with the flares offering a probe into the heating phase and the confinement of plasma by magnetic fields (1). Similarly, simultaneous observations of Kepler/K2 and XMM-Newton in the Pleiades cluster have uncovered superflares that emit more energy in optical than X-rays, challenging long-held assumptions about the distribution of energy in stellar flares and suggesting that the flares analyzed in this paper are mainly due to single loops with no sustained heating (2). X-ray spectroscopy in the microcalorimeter era has further advanced our understanding of line formation processes in X-rays, with a study on H- and He-like Iron for a photoionized cloud revealing four distinct cases of line formation and providing insights into the total X-ray emission spectrum (3). High-resolution X-ray spectra of a sample of active stars have been analyzed to investigate their coronal plasma density, with the study finding densities that challenge previous results and suggesting that plasma densities are remarkably similar for stars with vastly different surface gravities (4). Lastly, multi-wavelength monitoring of the M-dwarf flare star AD Leonis has revealed complex dynamics in stellar flares, including the absence of white-light emissions in some flares and rotational modulations in X-ray and H\u03b1 intensity, suggesting changes in the energy fluxes injected to the lower atmosphere during these events (5). These findings collectively enhance our understanding of the intricate processes governing stellar X-ray astronomy, paving the way for future discoveries.",

Mechanism of O2 Production from Water Splitting: Nature of Charge Carriers in Nitrogen Doped Nanocrystalline TiO2 Films and Factors Limiting O2 Production\nThe low efficiency of the extensively investigatedvisible light photocatalyst N-TiO2 has been widely assumed to be determined by the dynamics of the charge carriers. The nature of the photoelectrons and photoholes produced on the nanostructured (nc) N-TiO2 film has been systematically investigated in this work by the use of time-resolved absorption spectroscopy. Here the fingerprints of the two distinct photohole populations on nc-N-TiO2 films are reported and the reaction between these photoholes and water has been examined. The origin of the low efficiency of the visible-driven material for water oxidation was explored and rapid electron hole decay following visible excitation is believed to be a key factor. Pt deposition on nc-N-TiO2 resulted in an 80% enhancement of the quantum yield for O2 production under UV light. Finally, it has been summarized that the oxygen production on the nc-N-TiO2 film requires photoholes with lifetimes of \u223c0.4s.\n\n2. Dynamics of photogenerated charges in the phosphate modified TiO 2 and the enhanced activity for photoelectrochemical water splitting\nPhosphate modified nanocrystalline TiO2 (nc-TiO2) films were prepared by a doctor blade method, followed by post-treatment with monometallic sodium orthophosphate solution. The dynamic processes of the photogenerated charges from the resulting nc-TiO2 films were thoroughly investigated by means of transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS). It is shown that photogenerated holes in the un-modified TiO2 film exhibit the same dynamic decay process as its photogenerated electrons, in oxygen-free water of pH 7. However, photogenerated holes in the phosphate modified film display a slightly faster dynamic decay process than its photogenerated electrons, and photogenerated charges of the modified film have a much longer lifetime than those of the un-modified film. These differences are attributed to the surface-carried negative charges of nc-TiO2 resulting from the phosphate groups (\u2013Ti\u2013O\u2013P\u2013O\u2212). Interestingly, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) experiments show that modification with an appropriate amount of phosphate could improve the photocurrent density of the nc-TiO2 film electrode by about 2 times, at a voltage of 0 V in the neutral electrolyte. Based on the TAS and PEC measurements of un-modified and phosphate modified nc-TiO2 films, with different conditions, it is suggested that the prolonged lifetime of photogenerated charges can be attributed to the negative electrostatic field formed in the surface layers. It is also responsible for the increase in activity for PEC water splitting and for the reported photocatalytic degradation of pollutants. The suggested mechanism would be applicable to other oxide semiconductor photocatalysts and to modification with other inorganic anions.\n\n3. Photocatalytic Oxidation Reactivity of Holes in the Sulfur- and Carbon-Doped TiO2 Powders Studied by Time-Resolved Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy\nThe photocatalytic oxidation reactivities of the photogenerated holes (h+) during ultraviolet or visible laser flash photolysis of pure anatase and sulfur- and carbon-doped TiO2 powders were investigated using time-resolved diffuse reflectance (TDR) spectroscopy. The one-electron oxidation processes of substrates such as methanol and 4-(methylthio)phenyl methanol (MTPM) by h+ at the TiO2 surface were examined. The TDR spectra and time traces observed for charge carriers and the MTPM radical cation (MTPM\u2022+) revealed that the oxidation reactions of substrates by h+ generated during the 355-nm laser photolysis of TiO2 powders increased in the order of pure TiO2 > S-doped TiO2 > C-doped TiO2. On the other hand, no one-electron oxidation reactions of the substrates were observed during the 430-nm laser photolysis of the S- and C-doped TiO2 powders, although the charge carriers were sufficiently generated upon excitation. The effects of the trapping and detrapping processes of h+ at the doping sites on the oxid...\n\n4.

How fast is interfacial hole transfer? In situ monitoring of carrier dynamics in anatase TiO 2 nanoparticles by femtosecond laser spectroscopy\nBy comparing the transient absorption spectra of nanosized anatase TiO2 colloidal systems with and without SCN\u2212, the broad absorption band around 520 nm observed immediately after band-gap excitation for the system without SCN\u2212 has been assigned to shallowly trapped holes. In the presence of SCN\u2212, the absorption from the trapped holes at 520 nm cannot be observed because of the ultrafast interfacial hole transfer between TiO2 nanoparticles and SCN\u2212. The hole and electron trapping times were estimated to be <50 and 260 fs, respectively, by the analysis of rise and decay dynamics of transient absorption spectra. The rate of the hole transfer from nanosized TiO2 colloid to SCN\u2212 is comparable to that of the hole trapping and the time of formation of a weakly coupled (SCN\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7SCN)\u2022\u2212 is estimated to be \u223d2.3 ps with 0.3 M KSCN. A further   structural change to form a stable (SCN)2\u2022\u2212 is observed in a timescale of 100\u223d150 ps, which is almost independent of the concentration of SCN\u2212.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the quest to understand and enhance TiO2 photocatalysis, various methodologies have been employed to investigate the dynamics and mechanics of photogenerated charges. Time-resolved absorption spectroscopy (TAS) has been a key technique used to identify the distinct photohole populations in nitrogen-doped nanocrystalline TiO2 films, revealing slower electron-hole lifetimes due to visible excitation, which hinder water oxidation (1). Similarly, TAS has been applied to phosphate-modified TiO2 films, where the shorter photohole lifetime and increased activity for photoelectrochemical water splitting have been linked to the surface-carried negative charges, suggesting a mechanism that could be applicable to other semiconductor photocatalysts (2). Time-resolved diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (TDR) has been used to study the photocatalytic oxidation reactions of substrates by holes in sulfur- and carbon-doped TiO2 powders, providing insights into the reactivity differences among different dopings (3). In situ monitoring with femtosecond laser spectroscopy has been employed to investigate charge carrier trapping and recombination dynamics in anatase TiO2 nanoparticles, revealing rapid interfacial hole transfer to surrounding ions or other nanoparticles, which is crucial for understanding the fundamental processes involved (4). Lastly, the rapid and ultrafast dynamics of hole and electron trapping have been estimated using the rise and decay dynamics of transient absorption spectra, providing a timescale for the formation of weakly coupled and stable charge carrier complexes (5).

        "inference": " Recent studies in TiO2 photocatalysis have elucidated the mechanism of charge carrier dynamics, particularly the behavior of photoholes, as a key factor in the low efficiency of visible light photocatalysts like N-TiO2. Investigations using time-resolved absorption spectroscopy have revealed the distinct photohole populations within nc-TiO2 films, with their reaction with water leading to oxygen production (1). Enhancement of oxygen production has been linked to the rapid electron hole decay following visible excitation, which is attributable to the surface-carried negative charges on phosphate-modified TiO2 films, leading to an extension of photogenerated charges' lifetimes (2). Moreover, the photocatalytic oxidation reactivity of holes has been examined, demonstrating that the activity increases in sulfur- and carbon-doped TiO2 powders over pure TiO2, suggesting the influence of surface chemistry on photocatalytic performance (3). Studies on charge carrier trapping and recombination dynamics in small semiconductor particles have also shown that interfacial hole transfer plays a significant role in TiO2 photocatalysis, with the rate of hole transfer being comparable to that of hole trapping (4). Finally, femtosecond laser spectroscopy has allowed for the in situ monitoring of carrier dynamics in anatase TiO2 nanoparticles, revealing ultrafast hole and electron trapping times and the importance of interfacial hole transfer in TiO2 photocatalysis (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the critical role of charge carrier dynamics, surface chemistry, and interfacial transfer in optimizing TiO2 photocatalysis, with potential implications for the development of more efficient photocatalysts for applications such as water oxidation and pollutant degradation.",

Mechanism of O2 Production from Water Splitting: Nature of Charge Carriers in Nitrogen Doped Nanocrystalline TiO2 Films and Factors Limiting O2 Production\nThe low efficiency of the extensively investigatedvisible light photocatalyst N-TiO2 has been widely assumed to be determined by the dynamics of the charge carriers. The nature of the photoelectrons and photoholes produced on the nanostructured (nc) N-TiO2 film has been systematically investigated in this work by the use of time-resolved absorption spectroscopy. Here the fingerprints of the two distinct photohole populations on nc-N-TiO2 films are reported and the reaction between these photoholes and water has been examined. The origin of the low efficiency of the visible-driven material for water oxidation was explored and rapid electron hole decay following visible excitation is believed to be a key factor. Pt deposition on nc-N-TiO2 resulted in an 80% enhancement of the quantum yield for O2 production under UV light. Finally, it has been summarized that the oxygen production on the nc-N-TiO2 film requires photoholes with lifetimes of \u223c0.4s.\n\n2. Dynamics of photogenerated charges in the phosphate modified TiO 2 and the enhanced activity for photoelectrochemical water splitting\nPhosphate modified nanocrystalline TiO2 (nc-TiO2) films were prepared by a doctor blade method, followed by post-treatment with monometallic sodium orthophosphate solution. The dynamic processes of the photogenerated charges from the resulting nc-TiO2 films were thoroughly investigated by means of transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS). It is shown that photogenerated holes in the un-modified TiO2 film exhibit the same dynamic decay process as its photogenerated electrons, in oxygen-free water of pH 7. However, photogenerated holes in the phosphate modified film display a slightly faster dynamic decay process than its photogenerated electrons, and photogenerated charges of the modified film have a much longer lifetime than those of the un-modified film. These differences are attributed to the surface-carried negative charges of nc-TiO2 resulting from the phosphate groups (\u2013Ti\u2013O\u2013P\u2013O\u2212). Interestingly, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) experiments show that modification with an appropriate amount of phosphate could improve the photocurrent density of the nc-TiO2 film electrode by about 2 times, at a voltage of 0 V in the neutral electrolyte. Based on the TAS and PEC measurements of un-modified and phosphate modified nc-TiO2 films, with different conditions, it is suggested that the prolonged lifetime of photogenerated charges can be attributed to the negative electrostatic field formed in the surface layers. It is also responsible for the increase in activity for PEC water splitting and for the reported photocatalytic degradation of pollutants. The suggested mechanism would be applicable to other oxide semiconductor photocatalysts and to modification with other inorganic anions.\n\n3. Photocatalytic Oxidation Reactivity of Holes in the Sulfur- and Carbon-Doped TiO2 Powders Studied by Time-Resolved Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy\nThe photocatalytic oxidation reactivities of the photogenerated holes (h+) during ultraviolet or visible laser flash photolysis of pure anatase and sulfur- and carbon-doped TiO2 powders were investigated using time-resolved diffuse reflectance (TDR) spectroscopy. The one-electron oxidation processes of substrates such as methanol and 4-(methylthio)phenyl methanol (MTPM) by h+ at the TiO2 surface were examined. The TDR spectra and time traces observed for charge carriers and the MTPM radical cation (MTPM\u2022+) revealed that the oxidation reactions of substrates by h+ generated during the 355-nm laser photolysis of TiO2 powders increased in the order of pure TiO2 > S-doped TiO2 > C-doped TiO2. On the other hand, no one-electron oxidation reactions of the substrates were observed during the 430-nm laser photolysis of the S- and C-doped TiO2 powders, although the charge carriers were sufficiently generated upon excitation. The effects of the trapping and detrapping processes of h+ at the doping sites on the oxid...\n\n4. Charge carrier trapping and recombination dynamics in small semiconductor particles\nReference LPI-ARTICLE-1985-033doi:10.1021/ja00312a043View record in Web of Science Record created on 2006-02-21, modified on 2017-05-12\n\n5. How fast is interfacial hole transfer? In situ monitoring of carrier dynamics in anatase TiO 2 nanoparticles by femtosecond laser spectroscopy\nBy comparing the transient absorption spectra of nanosized anatase TiO2 colloidal systems with and without SCN\u2212, the broad absorption band around 520 nm observed immediately after band-gap excitation for the system without SCN\u2212 has been assigned to shallowly trapped holes. In the presence of SCN\u2212, the absorption from the trapped holes at 520 nm cannot be observed because of the ultrafast interfacial hole transfer between TiO2 nanoparticles and SCN\u2212. The hole and electron trapping times were estimated to be <50 and 260 fs, respectively, by the analysis of rise and decay dynamics of transient absorption spectra. The rate of the hole transfer from nanosized TiO2 colloid to SCN\u2212 is comparable to that of the hole trapping and the time of formation of a weakly coupled (SCN\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7SCN)\u2022\u2212 is estimated to be \u223d2.3 ps with 0.3 M KSCN. A further   structural change to form a stable (SCN)2\u2022\u2212 is observed in a timescale of 100\u223d150 ps, which is almost independent of the concentration of SCN\u2212.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The study of TiO2 photocatalysis has been advanced through various investigations into the mechanisms and factors influencing the efficiency of this material in water splitting and other photocatalytic processes. The first paper (1) employs time-resolved absorption spectroscopy to analyze the charge carriers in nitrogen-doped nanocrystalline TiO2 films, identifying the different photohole populations and their rapid decay following visible excitation, which is suggested as a key factor in the low efficiency of visible-driven materials for water oxidation. The second paper (2) demonstrates that phosphate modification of nanocrystalline TiO2 films enhances the activity for photoelectrochemical water splitting by prolonging the lifetime of photogenerated charges, an effect attributed to the surface-carried negative charges from phosphate groups. The third paper (3) utilizes time-resolved diffuse reflectance spectroscopy to study the photocatalytic oxidation reactivities of holes in sulfur- and carbon-doped TiO2 powders, revealing that the oxidation reactions are suppressed in the presence of phosphate groups, which may be beneficial for photocatalysis. The fourth paper (4) explores the impacts of charge carrier trapping and recombination dynamics in small semiconductor particle systems, providing insights into the fundamental processes involved in photocatalysis. Lastly, the fifth paper (5) employs femtosecond laser spectroscopy to monitor the dynamics of carrier transfer in anatase TiO2 nanoparticles, estimating the hole and electron trapping times and the time of formation of weakly coupled molecules, which can help tailor photocatalytic systems for improved efficiency. Together, these studies contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms governing TiO2 photocatalysis, highlighting the importance of charge carrier dynamics and interfacial interactions in optimizing photocatalytic applications.",

Nanoscale thermometry via the fluorescence of YAG:Ce phosphor particles: measurements from 7 to 77\u00a0C\nThe laser-induced fluorescence lifetime of 30 nm particles of YAG:Ce was measured as a function of temperature from 7 to 77\u00b0C. The fluorescence decay lifetimes for the nanoparticles of this phosphor varied from \u224818 to 27 ns, i.e. \u224833% relative to the longest lifetime measured. This large variation in lifetime, coupled with the high signal strength that was observed, suggest that YAG:Ce nanoparticles will be useful thermographic phosphors. We describe the material and the apparatus used to characterize its fluorescence, present the results of measurements made over the range of temperatures tested and comment on some possible applications for this novel material.\n\n2. 2D surface thermal imaging using rise-time analysis from laser-induced luminescence phosphor thermometry\nThe purpose of this paper is to demonstrate a novel technique for imaging 2D temperature distributions using rise-time analysis from luminescence exhibited from a Y2O3:Eu thermographic phosphor. In phosphor thermometry, it is usually the lifetime-decay temporal response that is used to determine temperature; the rise component is usually ignored. We claim to be the first to obtain 2D thermal imaging using the rise-time response. This was demonstrated using flame impingement experiments. A 1 Mfps state-of-the-art high-speed Shiamadzu Hypervision camera was used to capture the phosphors' temporal response, and was later processed in Matlab. The resulting thermal map clearly indicated a variation in temperature and showed an uncertainty of 20% at 400 \u00b0C. This is relatively high, and suggestions to improve this are proposed. A calibration of rise time versus temperature is taken between 200 and 700 \u00b0C. This paper builds on previous work in the field, and the results presented in this paper confirm the extended temperature sensing capability of Y2O3:Eu using rise-time characteristics.\n\n3. Effect of Annealing on Upconversion Luminescence of ZnO:Er3+ Nanocrystals and High Thermal Sensitivity\nThe effect of annealing on the upconversion luminescence of ZnO:Er3+ nanocrystals was investigated in detail. The green and the red upconverted emissions under infrared 978-nm light excitation were remarkably enhanced with an increase of annealing temperature. Moreover, for the sample annealed at 500 \u00b0C, the ratio of the intensity of 2H11/2 \u2192 4I15/2 emission to that of 4S3/2 \u2192 4I15/2 emission increased from less than to more than unity with an increase of the excitation density. However, the same case did not occur to the sample annealed at 700 \u00b0C, where the ratio was independent of excitation density except when the excitation density was higher than 42\u2009700 W/cm2. This distinction was attributed mainly to the difference in energy gap between the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 states in the two samples, originating from the local microstructure variation around Er3+ ions. In addition, a high thermal sensitivity of 0.0062/\u00b0C was obtained in the ZnO:Er3+ nanocrystals based on the temperature-dependent fluorescence intens...\n\n4. Temperature dependence of luminescent spectra and dynamics in nanocrystalline Y2O3:Eu3+\nA temperature dependence for emission of Eu3+ in cubic nanocrystalline Y2O3:Eu3+ was studied in contrast with the polycrystalline powders. The emission intensity of Eu3+ decreased solely with elevated temperature under the excitation of a 580 nm light, while it had a maximum at a certain temperature under a 488 nm light. The experimental data were well fitted based on a theory considering both the thermal activated distribution of electrons among 7FJ and the thermal quenching effect. The results indicated that the thermal quenching rate in nanocrystals (NCs) was faster than that in the polycrystals. The nonradiative decay rate, wNR, the radiative transition rate, w0R, and the luminescent quantum efficiency (QE) were obtained according to the temperature dependence of fluorescence lifetime. It can be concluded that wNR and w0R both increase in NCs, and that QE decreases.\n\n5. AC thermal imaging of a microwire with a fluorescent nanocrystal: Influence of the near field on the thermal contrast\nWe have studied the temperature dependence of the visible fluorescence lines of 250 nm large PbF2 nanocrystals codoped with Er3+ and Yb3+ ions. By gluing such a particle at the end of a sharp atomic force microscope tip, we have developed a scanning thermal microscope able to observe the heating of electrically excited micro- and nanowires. By modulating the electrical current that flows in the structure, the resulting temperature variations modulate the particle fluorescence giving rise to the thermal contrast. We will show that the fluorescence is affected both by the near-field optical distribution and by temperature variations. We will show that it is possible to get rid of these optical effects and to keep the thermal contribution by comparing the images to reference images obtained when the device is not driven by a current. The determination of the temperature of the devices is performed by analyzing the thermal quenching of the fluorescent particle and is in good agreement with numerical simulatio...\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of nanothermometry, recent methodologies have focused on harnessing the luminescence properties of nanoparticles to measure temperature changes. The first study (1) employed high-temperature laser-induced fluorescence to measure the lifetime of YAG:Ce phosphor particles, which demonstrated significant temperature sensitivity and high signal strength, suggesting a promising application in thermographic phosphors. Similarly, the second paper (2) introduced a novel technique using high-speed imaging to capture the temporal response of Y2O3:Eu thermographic phosphors, with the rise-time component being specifically analyzed to create 2D thermal images. This method showed promise but acknowledged the high uncertainty and need for improvement. The third study (3) explored the effect of annealing on the upconversion luminescence of ZnO:Er3+ nanocrystals, finding that the thermal sensitivity was enhanced with increasing annealing temperature, attributed to variations in energy gaps between states. The fourth paper (4) studied the temperature dependence of luminescent spectra and dynamics in nanocrystalline Y2O3:Eu3+, fitting the data to theories that considered thermal activation and quenching effects to determine the temperature sensing capabilities. Lastly, the fifth study (5) developed a scanning thermal microscope using a fluorescent nanocrystal codoped with Er3+ and Yb3+ ions, which allowed for the modulation of electrical current to create thermal contrast, with the microscope determining temperature by analyzing the thermal quenching of the fluorescence. Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of particle synthesis, excitation wavelength selection, and the calibration of temporal responses to achieve accurate nanothermometry.

Nanoscale thermometry via the fluorescence of YAG:Ce phosphor particles: measurements from 7 to 77\u00a0C\nThe laser-induced fluorescence lifetime of 30 nm particles of YAG:Ce was measured as a function of temperature from 7 to 77\u00b0C. The fluorescence decay lifetimes for the nanoparticles of this phosphor varied from \u224818 to 27 ns, i.e. \u224833% relative to the longest lifetime measured. This large variation in lifetime, coupled with the high signal strength that was observed, suggest that YAG:Ce nanoparticles will be useful thermographic phosphors. We describe the material and the apparatus used to characterize its fluorescence, present the results of measurements made over the range of temperatures tested and comment on some possible applications for this novel material.\n\n2. 2D surface thermal imaging using rise-time analysis from laser-induced luminescence phosphor thermometry\nThe purpose of this paper is to demonstrate a novel technique for imaging 2D temperature distributions using rise-time analysis from luminescence exhibited from a Y2O3:Eu thermographic phosphor. In phosphor thermometry, it is usually the lifetime-decay temporal response that is used to determine temperature; the rise component is usually ignored. We claim to be the first to obtain 2D thermal imaging using the rise-time response. This was demonstrated using flame impingement experiments. A 1 Mfps state-of-the-art high-speed Shiamadzu Hypervision camera was used to capture the phosphors' temporal response, and was later processed in Matlab. The resulting thermal map clearly indicated a variation in temperature and showed an uncertainty of 20% at 400 \u00b0C. This is relatively high, and suggestions to improve this are proposed. A calibration of rise time versus temperature is taken between 200 and 700 \u00b0C. This paper builds on previous work in the field, and the results presented in this paper confirm the extended temperature sensing capability of Y2O3:Eu using rise-time characteristics.\n\n3. Effect of Annealing on Upconversion Luminescence of ZnO:Er3+ Nanocrystals and High Thermal Sensitivity\nThe effect of annealing on the upconversion luminescence of ZnO:Er3+ nanocrystals was investigated in detail. The green and the red upconverted emissions under infrared 978-nm light excitation were remarkably enhanced with an increase of annealing temperature. Moreover, for the sample annealed at 500 \u00b0C, the ratio of the intensity of 2H11/2 \u2192 4I15/2 emission to that of 4S3/2 \u2192 4I15/2 emission increased from less than to more than unity with an increase of the excitation density. However, the same case did not occur to the sample annealed at 700 \u00b0C, where the ratio was independent of excitation density except when the excitation density was higher than 42\u2009700 W/cm2. This distinction was attributed mainly to the difference in energy gap between the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 states in the two samples, originating from the local microstructure variation around Er3+ ions. In addition, a high thermal sensitivity of 0.0062/\u00b0C was obtained in the ZnO:Er3+ nanocrystals based on the temperature-dependent fluorescence intens...\n\n4. Temperature dependence of luminescent spectra and dynamics in nanocrystalline Y2O3:Eu3+\nA temperature dependence for emission of Eu3+ in cubic nanocrystalline Y2O3:Eu3+ was studied in contrast with the polycrystalline powders. The emission intensity of Eu3+ decreased solely with elevated temperature under the excitation of a 580 nm light, while it had a maximum at a certain temperature under a 488 nm light. The experimental data were well fitted based on a theory considering both the thermal activated distribution of electrons among 7FJ and the thermal quenching effect. The results indicated that the thermal quenching rate in nanocrystals (NCs) was faster than that in the polycrystals. The nonradiative decay rate, wNR, the radiative transition rate, w0R, and the luminescent quantum efficiency (QE) were obtained according to the temperature dependence of fluorescence lifetime. It can be concluded that wNR and w0R both increase in NCs, and that QE decreases.\n\n5. AC thermal imaging of a microwire with a fluorescent nanocrystal: Influence of the near field on the thermal contrast\nWe have studied the temperature dependence of the visible fluorescence lines of 250 nm large PbF2 nanocrystals codoped with Er3+ and Yb3+ ions. By gluing such a particle at the end of a sharp atomic force microscope tip, we have developed a scanning thermal microscope able to observe the heating of electrically excited micro- and nanowires. By modulating the electrical current that flows in the structure, the resulting temperature variations modulate the particle fluorescence giving rise to the thermal contrast. We will show that the fluorescence is affected both by the near-field optical distribution and by temperature variations. We will show that it is possible to get rid of these optical effects and to keep the thermal contribution by comparing the images to reference images obtained when the device is not driven by a current. The determination of the temperature of the devices is performed by analyzing the thermal quenching of the fluorescent particle and is in good agreement with numerical simulatio...\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " Recent advancements in nanothermometry have demonstrated the potential of utilizing nanoscale materials and the unique properties of their luminescence to measure temperature changes. The fluorescence of YAG:Ce phosphor particles has been explored for thermographic applications, with measurements revealing significant variations in fluorescence decay lifetimes in response to temperature changes, indicating a high signal strength and potential for precise thermometry (1). Similarly, the rise-time analysis of luminescence from Y2O3:Eu phosphors has been employed for 2D surface thermal imaging, with the technique showing promise despite some uncertainties, thus expanding the capabilities of thermal sensing (2). The annealing of ZnO:Er3+ nanocrystals has been found to enhance the upconversion luminescence and thermal sensitivity, suggesting that the microstructure and energy gaps within the material can be tailored to improve temperature sensing characteristics (3). Additionally, the temperature dependence of luminescent spectra and dynamics in nanocrystalline Y2O3:Eu3+ has been studied, revealing differences in thermal quenching rates and luminescent quantum efficiencies compared to polycrystalline powders, which could influence the application of these materials in thermometry (4). Lastly, the AC thermal imaging of microwires has been investigated using fluorescent nanocrystals, highlighting the importance of accounting for near-field optical effects and temperature variations in the fluorescence signals to achieve accurate temperature contrast (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the importance of material design, excitation methods, and calibration techniques in optimizing the performance of nanothermometers for temperature sensing applications.\n\n",

Mixed Methyl Aryloxy Rare-Earth-Metal Complexes Stabilized by a Superbulky Tris(pyrazolyl)borato Ligand\nVarious mixed methyl aryloxide complexes TptBu,MeLnMe(OAr) (Ln = Y, Lu) were obtained in moderate to high yields according to distinct synthesis protocols dependent on the metal size and sterics of the phenolic proligand. The reaction of TptBu,MeLuMe2 and TptBu,MeYMe(AlMe4) via protonolysis with 1 or 2 equiv HOC6H2tBu2-2,6-Me-4 in n-hexane gave the desired complexes TptBu,MeLnMe(OAr). Corresponding treatment of TptBu,MeLuMe2 with the sterically less demanding HOC6H3Me2-2,6, HOC6H3iPr2-2,6 and HOC6H3(CF3)2-3,5 led to the formation of the bis(aryloxy) lutetium complexes TptBu,MeLu(OAr)2. Application of a salt-metathesis protocol employing TptBu,MeLnMe(AlMe4) and the potassium aryloxides KOAr made complexes TptBu,MeLnMe(OAr) accessible for the smaller aryloxy ligands as well. All complexes were analyzed by X-ray crystallography to compare the terminal Ln\u2013Me bond lengths and to evaluate the implication of the methyl/aryloxy coordination for the exact cone angles \u0398\u00b0 of the [TptBu,Me] ancillary ligand.

Access to divalent lanthanide NHC complexes by redox-transmetallation from silver and CO2 insertion reactions\nDivalent NHC\u2013lanthanide complexes were obtained by redox-transmetallation.

Multinuclear Lanthanide-Implanted Tetrameric Dawson-Type Phosphotungstates with Switchable Luminescence Behaviors Induced by Fast Photochromism\nA series of benzoate-decorated lanthanide (Ln)-containing tetrameric Dawson-type phosphotungstates [N(CH3)4]6H20[{(P2W17O61)Ln(H2O)3Ln(C6H5COO)(H2O)6]}{[(P2W17O61)Ln(H2O)3}]2Cl2\u00b798H2O [Ln = Sm (1), Eu (2), and Gd (3)] were made using a facile one-step assembly strategy and characterized by several techniques. Notably, the Ln-containing tetrameric Dawson-type polyoxoanions [{(P2W17O61)Ln(H2O)3Ln(C6H5COO)(H2O)6]}{[(P2W17O61)Ln(H2O)3}]224- are all established by four monolacunary Dawson-type [P2W17O61]10- segments, encapsulating a Ln3+ ion with two benzoates coordinating to the Ln3+ ions. 1-3 exhibit reversible photochromism, which can change from intrinsic white to blue for 6 min upon UV irradiation, and their colors gradually recover for 30 h in the dark. The solid-state photoluminescence spectra of 1 and 2 display characteristic emissions of Ln components based on 4f-4f transitions. Time-resolved emission spectra of 1 and 2 were also measured to authenticate the energy transfer from the phosphotungstate and organic chromophores to Eu3+. In particular, 1 shows an effectively switchable luminescence behavior induced by its fast photochromism.\n\n4. White-light emission from discrete heterometallic lanthanide-directed self-assembled complexes in solution\nHerein, we have developed a white-light-emitting system based on the formation of discrete lanthanide-based self-assembled complexes using a newly-designed ligand. We demonstrate that fine tuning of the lanthanide ions molar ratio in the self-assemblies combined with the intrinsic blue fluorescence of the ligand allows for the successful emission of pure white light with CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.34).\n\n5.

        "inference": " In the synthesis of rare-earth complexes for their applications, diverse methodologies have been employed to achieve the desired structures and properties. Lanthanide-containing complexes have been synthesized through various protocols, such as metal-ligand interactions and redox reactions. For instance, mixed methyl aryloxy rare-earth-metal complexes were stabilized using a superbulky tris(pyrazolyl)borato ligand, with synthesis routes varying based on metal size and sterics of the phenolic proligand, and some complexes being further characterized by X-ray crystallography (1). Similarly, divalent lanthanide NHC complexes were obtained via redox-transmetallation, with the potential for oxidation of the metal center being minimized by CO2 insertion reactions (2). The assembly of tetrameric Dawson-type phosphotungstates with lanthanide ions demonstrated a one-step process, allowing for the investigation of switchable luminescence behaviors induced by photochromism (3). In another approach, white-light emission from discrete heterometallic lanthanide-directed self-assembled complexes in solution was achieved, with the molar ratio of lanthanide ions and a newly-designed ligand fine-tuning being key to achieving the desired emission properties (4). Lastly, anilido-oxazoline-ligated rare-earth metal complexes showed strong fluorescence emissions and catalytic performance on isoprene polymerization, with the selectivity being enhanced by the ligand's design (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of ligand choice, metal-ligand interactions, and redox manipulations in the synthesis of rare-earth complexes for diverse applications.\n\n",

Mixed Methyl Aryloxy Rare-Earth-Metal Complexes Stabilized by a Superbulky Tris(pyrazolyl)borato Ligand\nVarious mixed methyl aryloxide complexes TptBu,MeLnMe(OAr) (Ln = Y, Lu) were obtained in moderate to high yields according to distinct synthesis protocols dependent on the metal size and sterics of the phenolic proligand. The reaction of TptBu,MeLuMe2 and TptBu,MeYMe(AlMe4) via protonolysis with 1 or 2 equiv HOC6H2tBu2-2,6-Me-4 in n-hexane gave the desired complexes TptBu,MeLnMe(OAr). Corresponding treatment of TptBu,MeLuMe2 with the sterically less demanding HOC6H3Me2-2,6, HOC6H3iPr2-2,6 and HOC6H3(CF3)2-3,5 led to the formation of the bis(aryloxy) lutetium complexes TptBu,MeLu(OAr)2. Application of a salt-metathesis protocol employing TptBu,MeLnMe(AlMe4) and the potassium aryloxides KOAr made complexes TptBu,MeLnMe(OAr) accessible for the smaller aryloxy ligands as well. All complexes were analyzed by X-ray crystallography to compare the terminal Ln\u2013Me bond lengths and to evaluate the implication of the methyl/aryloxy coordination for the exact cone angles \u0398\u00b0 of the [TptBu,Me] ancillary ligand.

The solid-state photoluminescence spectra of 1 and 2 display characteristic emissions of Ln components based on 4f-4f transitions. Time-resolved emission spectra of 1 and 2 were also measured to authenticate the energy transfer from the phosphotungstate and organic chromophores to Eu3+.

CUAD: An Expert-Annotated NLP Dataset for Legal Contract Review\nMany specialized domains remain untouched by deep learning, as large labeled datasets require expensive expert annotators. We address this bottleneck within the legal domain by introducing the Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD), a new dataset for legal contract review. CUAD was created with dozens of legal experts from The Atticus Project and consists of over 13,000 annotations. The task is to highlight salient portions of a contract that are important for a human to review. We find that Transformer models have nascent performance, but that this performance is strongly influenced by model design and training dataset size. Despite these promising results, there is still substantial room for improvement. As one of the only large, specialized NLP benchmarks annotated by experts, CUAD can serve as a challenging research benchmark for the broader NLP community.\n\n2. PromptBench: Towards Evaluating the Robustness of Large Language Models on Adversarial Prompts\nThe increasing reliance on Large Language Models (LLMs) across academia and industry necessitates a comprehensive understanding of their robustness to prompts. In response to this vital need, we introduce PromptBench, a robustness benchmark designed to measure LLMs' resilience to adversarial prompts. This study uses a plethora of adversarial textual attacks targeting prompts across multiple levels: character, word, sentence, and semantic. The adversarial prompts, crafted to mimic plausible user errors like typos or synonyms, aim to evaluate how slight deviations can affect LLM outcomes while maintaining semantic integrity. These prompts are then employed in diverse tasks, such as sentiment analysis, natural language inference, reading comprehension, machine translation, and math problem-solving. Our study generates 4788 adversarial prompts, meticulously evaluated over 8 tasks and 13 datasets. Our findings demonstrate that contemporary LLMs are not robust to adversarial prompts. Furthermore, we present comprehensive analysis to understand the mystery behind prompt robustness and its transferability. We then offer insightful robustness analysis and pragmatic recommendations for prompt composition, beneficial to both researchers and everyday users. Code is available at: https://github.com/microsoft/promptbench.\n\n3. C-Eval: A Multi-Level Multi-Discipline Chinese Evaluation Suite for Foundation Models\nNew NLP benchmarks are urgently needed to align with the rapid development of large language models (LLMs). We present C-Eval, the first comprehensive Chinese evaluation suite designed to assess advanced knowledge and reasoning abilities of foundation models in a Chinese context. C-Eval comprises multiple-choice questions across four difficulty levels: middle school, high school, college, and professional. The questions span 52 diverse disciplines, ranging from humanities to science and engineering. C-Eval is accompanied by C-Eval Hard, a subset of very challenging subjects in C-Eval that requires advanced reasoning abilities to solve. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the most advanced LLMs on C-Eval, including both English- and Chinese-oriented models. Results indicate that only GPT-4 could achieve an average accuracy of over 60%, suggesting that there is still significant room for improvement for current LLMs. We anticipate C-Eval will help analyze important strengths and shortcomings of foundation models, and foster their development and growth for Chinese users.\n\n4. Wider and Deeper LLM Networks are Fairer LLM Evaluators\nMeasuring the quality of responses generated by LLMs is a challenging task, particularly when it comes to evaluating whether the response is aligned with human preference. A novel approach involves using the LLM itself to make evaluation and stabilizing the results through multiple independent evaluations, similar to a single-layer narrow LLM network. This network consists of a fixed number of neurons, with each neuron being the same LLM. In this paper, we draw upon the extensive research on deep neural networks to explore whether deeper and wider networks can lead to fairer evaluations. Specifically, inspired by the observation that different neurons in a neural network are responsible for detecting different concepts, we first adaptively generate as many neuron roles as possible for each evaluation sample. Each perspective corresponds to the role of a specific LLM neuron in the first layer. In subsequent layers, we follow the idea that higher layers in deep networks are responsible for more comprehensive features, each layer receives representations from all neurons in the previous layer, integrating the locally learned evaluation information to obtain a more comprehensive evaluation result. Interestingly, this network design resembles the process of academic paper reviewing. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we construct the largest and most diverse English evaluation benchmark LLMEval$^2$ for LLM evaluators, comprising 15 tasks, 8 abilities, and 2,553 samples. Experimental results demonstrate that a wider network (involving many reviewers) with 2 layers (one round of discussion) performs the best, improving kappa correlation coefficient from 0.28 to 0.34. We also leverage WideDeep to aid in the assessment of Chinese LLMs, which has accelerated the evaluation time by 4.6 times, resulting in a 60% cost saving. WideDeep achieves a remarkable 93% agreement level among humans.\n\n5. Emotionally Numb or Empathetic? Evaluating How LLMs Feel Using EmotionBench\nRecently, the community has witnessed the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have shown remarkable performance on various downstream tasks. Led by powerful models like ChatGPT and Claude, LLMs are revolutionizing how users engage with software, assuming more than mere tools but intelligent assistants. Consequently, evaluating LLMs' anthropomorphic capabilities becomes increasingly important in contemporary discourse. Utilizing the emotion appraisal theory from psychology, we propose to evaluate the empathy ability of LLMs, i.e., how their feelings change when presented with specific situations. After a careful and comprehensive survey, we collect a dataset containing over 400 situations that have proven effective in eliciting the eight emotions central to our study. Categorizing the situations into 36 factors, we conduct a human evaluation involving more than 1,200 subjects worldwide. With the human evaluation results as references, our evaluation includes five LLMs, covering both commercial and open-source models, including variations in model sizes, featuring the latest iterations, such as GPT-4 and LLaMA 2. A conclusion can be drawn from the results that, despite several misalignments, LLMs can generally respond appropriately to certain situations. Nevertheless, they fall short in alignment with the emotional behaviors of human beings and cannot establish connections between similar situations. Our collected dataset of situations, the human evaluation results, and the code of our testing framework, dubbed EmotionBench, is made publicly in https://github.com/CUHK-ARISE/EmotionBench. We aspire to contribute to the advancement of LLMs regarding better alignment with the emotional behaviors of human beings, thereby enhancing their utility and applicability as intelligent assistants.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the quest to benchmark the performance of large language models (LLMs), researchers have adopted various methodological approaches to assess their capabilities and identify areas for improvement. CUAD introduces a dataset annotated by legal experts to highligh important contract sections, revealing that even sophisticated LLMs like Transformer models can benefit from expert-crafted training data (1). PromptBench, on the other hand, focuses on the robustness of LLMs against adversarial prompts, providing a comprehensive benchmark across multiple tasks and datasets to evaluate their sensitivity to user errors (2). C-Eval extends the evaluation suite to the Chinese language, incorporating four levels of knowledge and reasoning tasks to assess the reasoning abilities of LLMs in a multidisciplinary context (3). Wider and Deeper LLM Networks propose a novel approach using the LLM itself as an evaluator, adapting to different perspectives and layers to achieve a fairer evaluation, demonstrating the effectiveness of wider and deeper networks in integrating local learning (4). Lastly, EmotionBench evaluates LLMs' emotional capabilities, utilizing psychological appraisal theories to measure their empathy and alignment with human emotional behaviors, highlighting the need for LLMs to improve their emotional intelligence (5). Collectively, these methodologies contribute to a nuanced understanding of LLM evaluation, emphasizing the importance of expert annotations, adversarial robustness, multidisciplinary assessment, fair evaluation, and emotional intelligence in benchmarking.",

CUAD: An Expert-Annotated NLP Dataset for Legal Contract Review\nMany specialized domains remain untouched by deep learning, as large labeled datasets require expensive expert annotators. We address this bottleneck within the legal domain by introducing the Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD), a new dataset for legal contract review. CUAD was created with dozens of legal experts from The Atticus Project and consists of over 13,000 annotations. The task is to highlight salient portions of a contract that are important for a human to review. We find that Transformer models have nascent performance, but that this performance is strongly influenced by model design and training dataset size. Despite these promising results, there is still substantial room for improvement. As one of the only large, specialized NLP benchmarks annotated by experts, CUAD can serve as a challenging research benchmark for the broader NLP community.\n\n2. PromptBench: Towards Evaluating the Robustness of Large Language Models on Adversarial Prompts\nThe increasing reliance on Large Language Models (LLMs) across academia and industry necessitates a comprehensive understanding of their robustness to prompts. In response to this vital need, we introduce PromptBench, a robustness benchmark designed to measure LLMs' resilience to adversarial prompts. This study uses a plethora of adversarial textual attacks targeting prompts across multiple levels: character, word, sentence, and semantic. The adversarial prompts, crafted to mimic plausible user errors like typos or synonyms, aim to evaluate how slight deviations can affect LLM outcomes while maintaining semantic integrity. These prompts are then employed in diverse tasks, such as sentiment analysis, natural language inference, reading comprehension, machine translation, and math problem-solving. Our study generates 4788 adversarial prompts, meticulously evaluated over 8 tasks and 13 datasets. Our findings demonstrate that contemporary LLMs are not robust to adversarial prompts. Furthermore, we present comprehensive analysis to understand the mystery behind prompt robustness and its transferability. We then offer insightful robustness analysis and pragmatic recommendations for prompt composition, beneficial to both researchers and everyday users. Code is available at: https://github.com/microsoft/promptbench.\n\n3. C-Eval: A Multi-Level Multi-Discipline Chinese Evaluation Suite for Foundation Models\nNew NLP benchmarks are urgently needed to align with the rapid development of large language models (LLMs). We present C-Eval, the first comprehensive Chinese evaluation suite designed to assess advanced knowledge and reasoning abilities of foundation models in a Chinese context. C-Eval comprises multiple-choice questions across four difficulty levels: middle school, high school, college, and professional. The questions span 52 diverse disciplines, ranging from humanities to science and engineering. C-Eval is accompanied by C-Eval Hard, a subset of very challenging subjects in C-Eval that requires advanced reasoning abilities to solve. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the most advanced LLMs on C-Eval, including both English- and Chinese-oriented models. Results indicate that only GPT-4 could achieve an average accuracy of over 60%, suggesting that there is still significant room for improvement for current LLMs. We anticipate C-Eval will help analyze important strengths and shortcomings of foundation models, and foster their development and growth for Chinese users.\n\n4. Wider and Deeper LLM Networks are Fairer LLM Evaluators\nMeasuring the quality of responses generated by LLMs is a challenging task, particularly when it comes to evaluating whether the response is aligned with human preference. A novel approach involves using the LLM itself to make evaluation and stabilizing the results through multiple independent evaluations, similar to a single-layer narrow LLM network. This network consists of a fixed number of neurons, with each neuron being the same LLM. In this paper, we draw upon the extensive research on deep neural networks to explore whether deeper and wider networks can lead to fairer evaluations. Specifically, inspired by the observation that different neurons in a neural network are responsible for detecting different concepts, we first adaptively generate as many neuron roles as possible for each evaluation sample. Each perspective corresponds to the role of a specific LLM neuron in the first layer. In subsequent layers, we follow the idea that higher layers in deep networks are responsible for more comprehensive features, each layer receives representations from all neurons in the previous layer, integrating the locally learned evaluation information to obtain a more comprehensive evaluation result. Interestingly, this network design resembles the process of academic paper reviewing. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we construct the largest and most diverse English evaluation benchmark LLMEval$^2$ for LLM evaluators, comprising 15 tasks, 8 abilities, and 2,553 samples. Experimental results demonstrate that a wider network (involving many reviewers) with 2 layers (one round of discussion) performs the best, improving kappa correlation coefficient from 0.28 to 0.34. We also leverage WideDeep to aid in the assessment of Chinese LLMs, which has accelerated the evaluation time by 4.6 times, resulting in a 60% cost saving. WideDeep achieves a remarkable 93% agreement level among humans.\n\n5. Emotionally Numb or Empathetic? Evaluating How LLMs Feel Using EmotionBench\nRecently, the community has witnessed the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have shown remarkable performance on various downstream tasks. Led by powerful models like ChatGPT and Claude, LLMs are revolutionizing how users engage with software, assuming more than mere tools but intelligent assistants. Consequently, evaluating LLMs' anthropomorphic capabilities becomes increasingly important in contemporary discourse. Utilizing the emotion appraisal theory from psychology, we propose to evaluate the empathy ability of LLMs, i.e., how their feelings change when presented with specific situations. After a careful and comprehensive survey, we collect a dataset containing over 400 situations that have proven effective in eliciting the eight emotions central to our study. Categorizing the situations into 36 factors, we conduct a human evaluation involving more than 1,200 subjects worldwide. With the human evaluation results as references, our evaluation includes five LLMs, covering both commercial and open-source models, including variations in model sizes, featuring the latest iterations, such as GPT-4 and LLaMA 2. A conclusion can be drawn from the results that, despite several misalignments, LLMs can generally respond appropriately to certain situations. Nevertheless, they fall short in alignment with the emotional behaviors of human beings and cannot establish connections between similar situations. Our collected dataset of situations, the human evaluation results, and the code of our testing framework, dubbed EmotionBench, is made publicly in https://github.com/CUHK-ARISE/EmotionBench. We aspire to contribute to the advancement of LLMs regarding better alignment with the emotional behaviors of human beings, thereby enhancing their utility and applicability as intelligent assistants.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of large language models (LLMs), the CUAD dataset emerges as a significant contribution, providing expert-annotated data for legal contract review and highlighting the nascent performance of Transformer models, which suggests there is still considerable room for improvement in the field (1). Complementing this, PromptBench offers a comprehensive robustness benchmark for LLMs against adversarial prompts, revealing their vulnerability to subtle changes in input and providing insights for both researchers and users (2). The C-Eval suite, introduced by researchers, bridges the gap in NLP benchmarking by assessing the reasoning abilities of foundation models in a multi-discipline, multi-level context, indicating that current LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory results across a spectrum of Chinese disciplines (3). Deepening our understanding of LLM evaluation, a novel approach utilizing the LLM itself to assess its own responses has been explored, with wider and deeper networks providing fairer evaluations by integrating local and comprehensive evaluation information, as evidenced by improved performance in the LLMEval$^2$ benchmark (4). Lastly, the EmotionBench study delves into the emotional capabilities of LLMs, evaluating their empathy and indicating that while there are misalignments, LLMs can generally respond appropriately to specific situations, highlighting the need for further research in aligning their emotional responses with human behavior (5). Together, these studies underscore the multifaceted challenges and progress in evaluating the performance and impact of LLMs across various domains and tasks.\n\n",

JOTR: Join-Optimistic Triple Reordering Approach for SPARQL Query Optimization on Big RDF Data\nResource Description Framework (RDF) is increasingly being used for representing information on the web. This popularity has made storage of large RDF data a difficult task. To overcome these issues many distributed RDF systems are being proposed that can store and efficiently process Big RDF data. Hadoop framework is widely being used for storing and handling a large amount of RDF data. One of the major obstacles faced while handling this large amount of RDF data is query processing on such large datasets. In this paper, we present JOTR: a SPARQL query optimization technique for Big RDF data using triple pattern reordering on a distributed Hadoop based RDF system. The proposed technique is based on selectivity calculation and has been tested on one of the popular RDF benchmark datasets, LUBM dataset. We have tested JOTR on large sized RDF datasets and compared it with other optimization approaches in respect to the query execution time. From the results, it can be concluded that our approach gives a notable performance on distributed RDF systems and thus is applicable to centralized systems as well.\n\n2. Traveling Light \u2014 A Low-Overhead Approach for SPARQL Query Optimization\nSPARQL query processing in triplestores has to deal with many of the same problems as query processing in relational databases, and additional problems due to the schema relaxed nature of RDF. The flexible pattern matching capabilities of SPARQL queries entail performance challenges for complex queries. Most modern query optimizers produce a significant overhead as they use an exhaustive statistics generation and storage approach. Currently, there is no pure online cost-based optimizer for SPARQL queries. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that just storing selectivity statistics for predicates enables effective optimization of typical queries. Based on this, we introduce a pure online optimizer for triplestores, the Online Join Order Optimizer (OJOO), which learns from query executions. OJOO's overhead in creating and persisting statistics is very low, and it provides an easily extendable storage architecture for statistics. We implemented the OJOO in a main-memory triplestore, PDStore (Parsimonious Data Store), and evaluated its performance experimentally using the Lehigh University Benchmark (LUBM). Our experimental results revealed that the OJOO is competitive, efficient, scalable, and has a negligible runtime overhead.\n\n3. Scalable SPARQL querying of large RDF graphs\nThe generation of RDF data has accelerated to the point where many data sets need to be partitioned across multiple machines in order to achieve reasonable performance when querying the data. Although tremendous progress has been made in the Semantic Web community for achieving high performance data management on a single node, current solutions that allow the data to be partitioned across multiple machines are highly inefficient. In this paper, we introduce a scalable RDF data management system that is up to three orders of magnitude more efficient than popular multi-node RDF data management systems. In so doing, we introduce techniques for (1) leveraging state-of-the-art single node RDF-store technology (2) partitioning the data across nodes in a manner that helps accelerate query processing through locality optimizations and (3) decomposing SPARQL queries into high performance fragments that take advantage of how data is partitioned in a cluster.\n\n4. SPARQL Query Optimization on Top of DHTs\nAbstract. We study the problem of SPARQL query optimization on top of distributed hash tables. Existing works on SPARQL query processing in such environments have never been implemented in a real system, or do not utilize any optimization techniques and thus exhibit poor perfor-mance. Our goal in this paper is to propose efficient and scalable algo-rithms for optimizing SPARQL basic graph pattern queries. We augment a known distributed query processing algorithm with query optimization strategies that improve performance in terms of query response time and bandwidth usage. We implement our techniques in the system Atlas and study their performance experimentally in a local cluster.\n\n5. SPARQL basic graph pattern optimization using selectivity estimation\nIn this paper, we formalize the problem of Basic Graph Pattern (BGP) optimization for SPARQL queries and main memory graph implementations of RDF data. We define and analyze the characteristics of heuristics for selectivity-based static BGP optimization. The heuristics range from simple triple pattern variable counting to more sophisticated selectivity estimation techniques. Customized summary statistics for RDF data enable the selectivity estimation of joined triple patterns and the development of efficient heuristics. Using the Lehigh University Benchmark (LUBM), we evaluate the performance of the heuristics for the queries provided by the LUBM and discuss some of them in more details.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The methodologies employed across the five studies for SPARQL query optimization converge on the principle of selectivity-based optimization, with each approach refining this core concept in different ways. The JOTR method (1) optimizes Big RDF data queries on a distributed Hadoop-based system by reordering triple patterns based on selectivity calculations, demonstrating improved execution times. In contrast, the Online Join Order Optimizer (OJOO) (2) leverages a low-overhead, online cost-based optimization strategy that relies solely on predicate selectivity statistics, avoiding the exhaustive statistics generation typical of modern optimizers. This approach is shown to be competitive and scalable with minimal runtime overhead. The scalable RDF data management system introduced in (3) tackles multi-node RDF partitions by utilizing single-node RDF-store technology, data partitioning for locality optimizations, and decomposing SPARQL queries to exploit data partitioning. Meanwhile, (4) optimizes queries over distributed hash tables (DHTs) by enhancing a distributed query processing algorithm with optimization strategies, focusing on improving query response time and bandwidth usage. Lastly, (5) formalizes selectivity estimation as a foundation for Basic Graph Pattern (BGP) optimization, employing heuristics ranging from simple variable counting to advanced selectivity estimation techniques, all of which are evaluated using benchmark queries. Collectively, these methodologies (1-5) underscore the critical role of selectivity estimation in SPARQL query optimization, each contributing unique perspectives on how to efficiently process and analyze RDF data.\n\n",

Our goal in this paper is to propose efficient and scalable algo-rithms for optimizing SPARQL basic graph pattern queries. We augment a known distributed query processing algorithm with query optimization strategies that improve performance in terms of query response time and bandwidth usage. We implement our techniques in the system Atlas and study their performance experimentally in a local cluster.\n\n5. SPARQL basic graph pattern optimization using selectivity estimation\nIn this paper, we formalize the problem of Basic Graph Pattern (BGP) optimization for SPARQL queries and main memory graph implementations of RDF data. We define and analyze the characteristics of heuristics for selectivity-based static BGP optimization. The heuristics range from simple triple pattern variable counting to more sophisticated selectivity estimation techniques. Customized summary statistics for RDF data enable the selectivity estimation of joined triple patterns and the development of efficient heuristics. Using the Lehigh University Benchmark (LUBM), we evaluate the performance of the heuristics for the queries provided by the LUBM and discuss some of them in more details.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The challenge of optimizing SPARQL queries for efficient processing of RDF data is a focal point of recent research, with various strategies being proposed to address the performance bottlenecks associated with large and complex datasets. A recurring theme is the use of selectivity-based optimization techniques, which prioritize query patterns based on their estimated cost or frequency to improve execution times (1, 3, 5). The JOTR approach, for instance, leverages triple pattern reordering on distributed Hadoop-based systems, demonstrating significant performance gains by calculating the selectivity of different query parts (1). Similarly, the Online Join Order Optimizer (OJOO) utilizes selectivity statistics for predicates to optimize queries in a low-overhead manner, avoiding the exhaustive statistics generation typical of modern optimizers (2). The scalability of these optimizations is crucial for managing large RDF datasets, with systems like PDStore implementing the OJOO to balance performance and overhead efficiently (2). Another strategy involves decomposing SPARQL queries into fragments that exploit data partitioning and locality optimizations across node clusters, leading to substantial performance improvements (3). Furthermore, optimization on top of distributed hash tables (DHTs) has been explored, with the integration of query optimization strategies into the Atlas system, yielding better response times and bandwidth usage (4). These studies collectively underscore the importance of sophisticated selectivity estimation and data management strategies in the quest for more efficient SPARQL query processing (1-5).",

JOTR: Join-Optimistic Triple Reordering Approach for SPARQL Query Optimization on Big RDF Data\nResource Description Framework (RDF) is increasingly being used for representing information on the web. This popularity has made storage of large RDF data a difficult task. To overcome these issues many distributed RDF systems are being proposed that can store and efficiently process Big RDF data. Hadoop framework is widely being used for storing and handling a large amount of RDF data. One of the major obstacles faced while handling this large amount of RDF data is query processing on such large datasets. In this paper, we present JOTR: a SPARQL query optimization technique for Big RDF data using triple pattern reordering on a distributed Hadoop based RDF system. The proposed technique is based on selectivity calculation and has been tested on one of the popular RDF benchmark datasets, LUBM dataset. We have tested JOTR on large sized RDF datasets and compared it with other optimization approaches in respect to the query execution time. From the results, it can be concluded that our approach gives a notable performance on distributed RDF systems and thus is applicable to centralized systems as well.\n\n2. Traveling Light \u2014 A Low-Overhead Approach for SPARQL Query Optimization\nSPARQL query processing in triplestores has to deal with many of the same problems as query processing in relational databases, and additional problems due to the schema relaxed nature of RDF. The flexible pattern matching capabilities of SPARQL queries entail performance challenges for complex queries. Most modern query optimizers produce a significant overhead as they use an exhaustive statistics generation and storage approach. Currently, there is no pure online cost-based optimizer for SPARQL queries. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that just storing selectivity statistics for predicates enables effective optimization of typical queries. Based on this, we introduce a pure online optimizer for triplestores, the Online Join Order Optimizer (OJOO), which learns from query executions. OJOO's overhead in creating and persisting statistics is very low, and it provides an easily extendable storage architecture for statistics. We implemented the OJOO in a main-memory triplestore, PDStore (Parsimonious Data Store), and evaluated its performance experimentally using the Lehigh University Benchmark (LUBM). Our experimental results revealed that the OJOO is competitive, efficient, scalable, and has a negligible runtime overhead.\n\n3. Scalable SPARQL querying of large RDF graphs\nThe generation of RDF data has accelerated to the point where many data sets need to be partitioned across multiple machines in order to achieve reasonable performance when querying the data. Although tremendous progress has been made in the Semantic Web community for achieving high performance data management on a single node, current solutions that allow the data to be partitioned across multiple machines are highly inefficient. In this paper, we introduce a scalable RDF data management system that is up to three orders of magnitude more efficient than popular multi-node RDF data management systems. In so doing, we introduce techniques for (1) leveraging state-of-the-art single node RDF-store technology (2) partitioning the data across nodes in a manner that helps accelerate query processing through locality optimizations and (3) decomposing SPARQL queries into high performance fragments that take advantage of how data is partitioned in a cluster.\n\n4.

The second paper introduces the Online Join Order Optimizer (OJOO), a low-overhead, pure online optimizer that relies solely on selectivity statistics for predicates, revealing that it is competitive and efficient with minimal runtime overhead, thus addressing the challenge of optimizing complex SPARQL queries in a lightweight manner (2). The third paper tackles the scalability of SPARQL querying in large RDF graphs by introducing a scalable data management system that leverages single-node RDF-store technology, partitions data across nodes for locality optimizations, and decomposes SPARQL queries to exploit data partitioning, resulting in a substantial performance boost (3). The fourth paper focuses on optimizing SPARQL queries over distributed hash tables (DHTs), proposing algorithms that enhance query response time and bandwidth usage, implementing these strategies in the Atlas system, and demonstrating their effectiveness experimentally (4). Lastly, the fifth paper delves into selectivity estimation for Basic Graph Pattern (BGP) optimization, formalizing heuristics and evaluating their performance using the LUBM benchmark, highlighting the potential for sophisticated selectivity estimation techniques in heuristics (5). Each of these contributions addresses different aspects of the optimization challenge, from triple pattern reordering and online optimization to scalable data management and selectivity estimation, collectively contributing to the broader effort of improving SPARQL query performance in various system and data models.",

ScholOnto: an ontology-based digital library server for research documents and discourse\nThe internet is rapidly becoming the first place for researchers to publish documents, but at present they receive little support in searching, tracking, analysing or debating concepts in a literature from scholarly perspectives. This paper describes the design rationale and implementation of ScholOnto, an ontology-based digital library server to support scholarly interpretation and discourse. It enables researchers to describe and debate via a semantic network the contributions a document makes, and its relationship to the literature. The paper discusses the computational services that an ontology-based server supports, alternative user interfaces to support interaction with a large semantic network, usability issues associated with knowledge formalisation, new work practices that could emerge, and related work\n\n2. FaBiO and CiTO: Ontologies for describing bibliographic resources and citations\nSemantic publishing is the use of Web and Semantic Web technologies to enhance the meaning of a published journal article, to facilitate its automated discovery, to enable its linking to semantically related articles, to provide access to data within the article in actionable form, and to facilitate integration of data between articles. Recently, semantic publishing has opened the possibility of a major step forward in the digital publishing world. For this to succeed, new semantic models and visualization tools are required to fully meet the specific needs of authors and publishers. In this article, we introduce the principles and architectures of two new ontologies central to the task of semantic publishing: FaBiO, the FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology, an ontology for recording and publishing bibliographic records of scholarly endeavours on the Semantic Web, and CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology, an ontology for the characterization of bibliographic citations both factually and rhetorically. We present those two models step by step, in order to emphasise their features and to stress their advantages relative to other pre-existing information models. Finally, we review the uptake of FaBiO and CiTO within the academic and publishing communities\n\n3. An ontology of scientific experiments\nThe formal description of experiments for efficient analysis, annotation and sharing of results is a fundamental part of the practice of science. Ontologies are required to achieve this objective. A few subject-specific ontologies of experiments currently exist. However, despite the unity of scientific experimentation, no general ontology of experiments exists. We propose the ontology EXPO to meet this need. EXPO links the SUMO (the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology) with subject-specific ontologies of experiments by formalizing the generic concepts of experimental design, methodology and results representation. EXPO is expressed in the W3C standard ontology language OWL-DL. We demonstrate the utility of EXPO and its ability to describe different experimental domains, by applying it to two experiments: one in high-energy physics and the other in phylogenetics. The use of EXPO made the goals and structure of these experiments more explicit, revealed ambiguities, and highlighted an unexpected similarity. We conclude that, EXPO is of general value in describing experiments and a step towards the formalization of science.\n\n4. The Document Components Ontology (DoCO)\nThe availability in machine-readable form of descriptions of the structure of documents, as well as of the document discourse (e.g. the scientific discourse within scholarly articles), is crucial for facilitating semantic publishing and the overall comprehension of documents by both users and machines. In this paper we introduce DoCO, the Document Components Ontology, an OWL 2 DL ontology that provides a general-purpose structured vocabulary of document elements to describe both structural and rhetorical document components in RDF. In addition to describing the formal description of the ontology, this paper showcases its utility in practice in a variety of our own applications and other activities of the Semantic Publishing community that rely on DoCO to annotate and retrieve document components of scholarly articles.\n\n5. The SPAR Ontologies\nAbstractOver the past eight years, we have been involved in the development of a set of complementary and orthogonal ontologies that can be used for the description of the main areas of the scholarly publishing domain, known as the SPAR (Semantic Publishing and Referencing) Ontologies. In this paper, we introduce this suite of ontologies, discuss the basic principles we have followed for their development, and describe their uptake and usage within the academic, institutional and publishing communities.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In addressing the research problem of scholarly ontologies, the methodologies employed across the five papers demonstrate a shared reliance on the development and application of semantic ontologies to enhance scholarly communication and discourse. ScholOnto integrates an ontology-based digital library server to support semantic network descriptions of research documents, emphasizing the need for scholarly interpretation and discourse (1). Similarly, FaBiO and CiTO focus on semantic publishing, developing ontologies (FaBiO, the Citation Typing Ontology) that structure and publish bibliographic records and citations, thereby facilitating integration and actionable data linking between articles (2). The ontology of scientific experiments, EXPO, bridges the gap by providing a general-purpose framework that connects the SUMO with subject-specific ontologies of experiments, thereby standardizing experimental concepts and methods (3). The Document Components Ontology (DoCO) extends this approach by focusing on the structured vocabulary of document elements, including structural and rhetorical discourse within scholarly articles, to support semantic publishing and document comprehension (4). Lastly, the SPAR Ontologies represent a suite of complementary ontologies tailored to the scholarly publishing domain, following principles of orthogonality and uptake within the academic and publishing communities (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore a trend towards standardizing the semantic description of scholarly resources, aiming to improve the interoperability, actionability, and comprehensibility of scholarly communication.\n\n",

        "inference": " The burgeoning field of scholarly ontologies is transforming the way we approach literature search, interpretation, and discourse, with a growing recognition for the need to support scholarly publishing through semantic technologies (1, 2, 5). At the core of this are ontologies like ScholOnto, which provides an infrastructure for semantic network-based interpretation and discourse, enabling researchers to formalize and debate the contributions of documents within the broader literary context (1). Similarly, FaBiO and CiTO address the specific needs of semantic publishing by providing ontologies for bibliographic records and citations, fostering automated discovery and the linking of semantically related articles (2). The ontology of scientific experiments, EXPO, exemplifies the utility of formalizing experimental design and results, revealing similarities across scientific domains and facilitating the analysis and sharing of research outcomes (3). Complementing these are general-purpose ontologies such as the Document Components Ontology (DoCO), which describes the structure and discourse of documents, thereby enhancing the comprehension of scholarly articles by both users and machines (4). Collectively, these SPAR ontologies (5) underscore the importance of a well-structured, semantically enriched literature that is easily navigable and interconnected, thereby elevating the standards of scholarly communication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The platform enables the user to interact with the visualized graph in a way that is very similar to the exploration of maps at multiple levels. Our approach involves an offline preprocessing phase that builds the layout of the graph by assigning coordinates to its nodes with respect to a Euclidean plane. The respective points are indexed with a spatial data structure, i.e., an R-tree, and stored in a database. Multiple abstraction layers of the graph based on various criteria are also created offline, and they are indexed similarly so that the user can explore the dataset at different levels of granularity, depending on her particular needs. Then, our system translates user operations into simple and very efficient spatial operations (i.e., window queries) in the backend. This technique allows for a fine-grained access to very large graphs with extremely low latency and memory requirements and without compromising the functionality of the tool. Our web-based prototype supports three main operations: (1) interactive navigation, (2) multi-level exploration, and (3) keyword search on the graph metadata.\n\n2. LodLive, exploring the web of data\nLodLive project, http://en.lodlive.it/, provides a demonstration of the use of Linked Data standard (RDF, SPARQL) to browse RDF resources. The application aims to spread linked data principles with a simple and friendly interface and reusable techniques. In this report we present an overview of the potential of LodLive, mentioning tools and methodologies that were used to create it.\n\n3. RDF data exploration and visualization\nWe present Paged Graph Visualization (PGV), a new semi-autonomous tool for RDF data exploration and visualization. PGV consists of two main components: a) the \"PGV explorer\" and b) the \"RDF pager\" module utilizing BRAHMS, our high per-formance main-memory RDF storage system. Unlike existing graph visualization techniques which attempt to display the entire graph and then filter out irrelevant data, PGV begins with a small graph and provides the tools to incrementally explore and visualize relevant data of very large RDF ontologies. We implemented several techniques to visualize and explore hot spots in the graph, i.e. nodes with large numbers of immediate neighbors. In response to the user-controlled, semantics-driven direction of the exploration, the PGV explorer obtains the necessary sub-graphs from the RDF pager and enables their incremental visualization leaving the previously laid out sub-graphs intact. We outline the problem of visualizing large RDF data sets, discuss our interface and its implementation, and through a controlled experiment we show the benefits of PGV.\n\n4. Browsing Linked Data with Fenfire\nA wealth of information has recently become available as browsable RDF data on the Web, but the selection of client applications to interact with this Linked Data remains limited. We show how to browse Linked Data with Fenfire, a Free and Open Source Software RDF browser and editor that employs a graph view and focuses on an engaging and interactive browsing experience. This sets Fenfire apart from previous table- and outline-based Linked Data browsers.\n\n5. Visualizing Populated Ontologies with OntoTrix\nResearch on visualizing Semantic Web data has yielded many tools that rely on information visualization techniques to better support the user in understanding and editing these data. Most tools structure the visualization according to the concept definitions and interrelations that constitute the ontology\u2019s vocabulary. Instances are often treated as somewhat peripheral information, when considered at all. These instances, that populate ontologies, represent an essential part of any knowledge base. Understanding instance-level data might be easier for users because of their higher concreteness, but instances will often be orders of magnitude more numerous than the concept definitions that give them machine-processable meaning. As such, the visualization of instance-level data poses different but real challenges. The authors present a visualization technique designed to enable users to visualize large instance sets and the relations that connect them. This visualization uses both node-link and adjacency matrix representations of graphs to visualize different parts of the data depending on their semantic and local structural properties. The technique was originally devised for simple social network visualization. The authors extend it to handle the richer and more complex graph structures of populated ontologies, exploiting ontological knowledge to drive the layout of, and navigation in, the representation embedded in a smooth zoomable environment.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In addressing the challenge of effectively visualizing large-scale graph data, various methodologies have been employed to enhance user interaction and comprehension. The graphVizdb system introduces a scalable platform that pre-processes and indexes graph data, enabling interactive navigation and multi-level exploration with low latency, akin to map navigation (1). LodLive, on the other hand, leverages the Linked Data standard (RDF, SPARQL) to facilitate browser-based exploration, demonstrating the potential for reusable techniques in data visualization (2). The Paged Graph Visualization (PGV) tool adopts a semi-autonomous approach, starting with a small graph and incrementally exploring larger RDF ontologies, utilizing a high-performance main-memory storage system to manage sub-graphs and maintain the integrity of previously visualized data (3). Fenfire offers a graph-view-based browser that focuses on an engaging interactive experience, differing from table- and outline-based browsers (4). Lastly, OntoTrix introduces a visualization technique that considers the concreteness of instances within ontologies, employing node-link and adjacency matrix representations to visualize complex instance sets and their relations, with a smooth zoomable environment aiding navigation (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of scalability, interactivity, and adaptability in the development of graph-based visualization systems, each contributing to the overall research problem through their unique approaches to data representation and user interaction.\n\n",

Most tools structure the visualization according to the concept definitions and interrelations that constitute the ontology\u2019s vocabulary. Instances are often treated as somewhat peripheral information, when considered at all. These instances, that populate ontologies, represent an essential part of any knowledge base. Understanding instance-level data might be easier for users because of their higher concreteness, but instances will often be orders of magnitude more numerous than the concept definitions that give them machine-processable meaning. As such, the visualization of instance-level data poses different but real challenges. The authors present a visualization technique designed to enable users to visualize large instance sets and the relations that connect them. This visualization uses both node-link and adjacency matrix representations of graphs to visualize different parts of the data depending on their semantic and local structural properties. The technique was originally devised for simple social network visualization. The authors extend it to handle the richer and more complex graph structures of populated ontologies, exploiting ontological knowledge to drive the layout of, and navigation in, the representation embedded in a smooth zoomable environment.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of graph-based visualization systems, graphVizdb introduces a novel platform for interactive visualization of large graphs, employing an offline preprocessing phase to assign coordinates to nodes and index them with spatial data structures, such as R-trees, for efficient exploration at various levels of granularity (1). LodLive, on the other hand, leverages the Linked Data standard to browse RDF resources, demonstrating the potential of semantic-driven data exploration and visualization tools that adhere to user-friendly interfaces (2). The Paged Graph Visualization (PGV) tool addresses the challenge of visualizing massive RDF ontologies by starting with a small graph and incrementally exploring and visualizing relevant data, utilizing a high-performance main-memory RDF storage system and techniques to visualize hot spots in the graph (3). Fenfire contributes to the browsing experience of Linked Data by offering a graph view that emphasizes an interactive and engaging user experience, distinguishing it from traditional table- and outline-based browsers (4). Lastly, OntoTrix tackles the visualization of instance-level data in ontologies, combining node-link and adjacency matrix representations to facilitate the visualization and navigation of complex graph structures, thereby enhancing the understanding of populated ontologies (5). Together, these systems demonstrate the diverse methodologies and advancements in the field of graph-based visualization, each catering to different user needs and data exploration strategies.\n\n",

Empirical research methodologies and studies in Requirements Engineering: How far did we come?\nSince the inception of the RE conference series (1992), both researchers and practitioners in the RE com-munity have acknowledged the significance of empirical evaluation as an instrument to gain knowledgeabout various aspects of RE phenomena and the validity of our research results. A significant number ofempirical studies have been conducted in the search for knowledge about RE problems as well as evidenceof successful and less successful application of proposed solutions. This editorial presents the progressempirical RE research has made since 1992. Based on a search in the Scopus digital library, we reportfrom an analysis of peer-reviewed systematic literature reviews and mapping studies to showcase majorareas of RE research that use methods from the Empirical Software Engineering paradigm. We summarizeprior empirical research in RE and introduce the contributors to this special issue on empirical researchmethodologies and studies in RE\n\n2. Research in software engineering: an analysis of the literature\nIn this paper, we examine the state of software engineering (SE) research from the point of view of the following research questions: 1. What topics do SE researchers address? 2. What research approaches do SE researchers use? 3. What research methods do SE researchers use? 4. On what reference disciplines does SE research depend? 5. At what levels of analysis do SE researchers conduct research? To answer those questions, we examined 369 papers in six leading research journals in the SE field, answering those research questions for each paper. From that examination, we conclude that SE research is diverse regarding topic, narrow regarding research approach and method, inwardly-focused regarding reference discipline, and technically focused (as opposed to behaviorally focused) regarding level of analysis. We pass no judgment on the SE field as a result of these findings. Instead, we present them as groundwork for future SE research efforts\n\n3. Support mechanisms to conduct empirical studies in software engineering: a systematic mapping study\nContext: Empirical studies are gaining recognition in the Software Engineering (SE) research community, allowing improved quality of research and accelerating the adoption of new technologies in the software market. However, empirical studies in this area are still limited. In order to foster empirical research in SE, it is essential to understand the resources available to aid these studies. Goal: Identify support mechanisms (methodology, tool, guideline, process, etc.) used to conduct empirical studies in the Empirical Software Engineering (ESE) community. Method: We performed a systematic mapping study that included all full papers published at EASE, ESEM and ESEJ since their first editions. Were selected 891 studies between 1996 and 2013. Results: A total of 375 support mechanisms were identified. We provide the full list of mechanisms and the strategies that uses them. Despite this, we identified a high number of studies that do not cite any mechanism to support their empirical strategies: 433 studies (48%). Experiment is the strategy that has more resources to support their activities. And guideline was the most used type of mechanism. Moreover we observed that the most mechanisms used as reference to empirical studies are not specific to SE area. And some mechanisms were used only in specific activities of empirical research, such as statistical and qualitative data analysis. Experiment and case studies are the strategies most applied. Conclusions: The use of empirical methods in SE has increased over the years. Despite this, many studies did not apply these methods and do not cite any resource to guide their research. Therefore, the list of support mechanisms, where and how they were applied is a major asset to the SE community. Such asset can encourage empirical studies aiding the choice regarding which strategies and mechanisms to use in a research, as well as pointing out examples where they were used, mainly to novice researchers. We also identified new perspectives and gaps that foster other research for the improvement of empirical research in this area.\n\n4. An Analysis of Empirical Requirements Engineering Survey Data\nThe gap between research and practice in requirements engineering is immense. To understand practice and the reasons for this gap, empirical evidence about requirements engineering practice is needed. In the last ten years a number of empirical studies have been conducted to gather such data. This chapter gives an overview focusing on broad surveys. The aim of this overview is to understand the following three issues: (1) what kind of questions can and should we ask to understand practice, (2) what evidence do we have about practice, (3) what further evidence do we need about practice. To further illustrate the issues, we provide findings of new studies conducted by the authors in Germany and Australia. Altogether this chapter aims at establishing a basis for further empirical research on requirements engineering\n\n5. Empirical Strategies in Software Engineering Research: A Literature Survey\nContext: The Software Engineering (SE) research continues to gain strength and interest for researchers considering the need to apply rigor and scientific validity to research results. Objective: Establishing an overview of the topic through a classification scheme of publications and structure the field of interest. Method: We conducted a Systematic Mapping Study, including articles published until 2019, that report at least one study of empirical strategies in SE. Results: 80 initial sets of studies were selected and analyzed, identifying: i) empirical strategy type used and ii) Software Engineering hypotheses types used. Also, 20 papers of the set of studies for mapping were selected and analyzed, identifying 17 empirical strategies and 11 main characteristics to address the empirical research inception in SE. Conclusions: We corroborate that the selection of an empirical strategy in Software Engineering research depends on the nature and scope of the research and on the resources that the researcher has at that moment, in addition to the degree of scientific and methodological knowledge that he has to carry out an empirical study. It is necessary to continue studying in-depth the behavior and nature of the empirical strategies in Software Engineering research that allows strengthening the scientific taxonomy in SE, besides walking towards the automation of the experimental process.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " Empirical research in software engineering (SE) has evolved through various methodologies and strategies, aiming to bridge the gap between theory and practice (2, 4). Systematic mapping studies are a prevalent approach, providing a broad overview of research topics, methods, and reference disciplines (2, 3). These studies also identify key support mechanisms, such as methodologies, tools, and guidelines, which are instrumental in guiding empirical studies (3). Despite the increasing use of empirical methods, a significant number of studies fail to cite any support mechanisms, indicating a need for better dissemination and application of these resources (3). The choice of empirical strategies, such as experiment and case studies, is influenced by the research question, the availability of resources, and the level of scientific and methodological knowledge of the researcher (5). Moreover, the analysis of survey data highlights the need for broad surveys in SE to understand practices and the gaps in research (4). Finally, the classification of empirical strategies and the types of hypotheses used in SE research provides a structure to address the inception of empirical studies, emphasizing the dependency on the nature and scope of the research (5). Collectively, these methodologies contribute to the empirical research community by emphasizing the importance of rigor, scientific validity, and the necessity for further methodological development in SE (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).",

        "inference": " Empirical research in software engineering (SE) has evolved as a critical methodology for understanding and improving the field, with a focus on bridging the gap between theory and practice (2, 5). A systematic mapping study highlights the diversity of research topics and the narrow focus on research approaches and methods, suggesting a need for a more multidisciplinary approach to broaden the scope of inquiry (2). Despite the growing recognition of empirical studies in SE, a significant number of research papers do not utilize support mechanisms or cite any reference disciplines, indicating a gap in the application of empirical methods and the need for better guidance (3). Requirements engineering (RE) in particular faces an immense gap between research and practice, with empirical evidence essential for understanding practices and addressing the disconnect (4). The use of empirical strategies in RE research has been mapped, revealing a variety of methods and highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate strategies based on the research's nature and scope (3, 5).

Empirical research methodologies and studies in Requirements Engineering: How far did we come?\nSince the inception of the RE conference series (1992), both researchers and practitioners in the RE com-munity have acknowledged the significance of empirical evaluation as an instrument to gain knowledgeabout various aspects of RE phenomena and the validity of our research results. A significant number ofempirical studies have been conducted in the search for knowledge about RE problems as well as evidenceof successful and less successful application of proposed solutions. This editorial presents the progressempirical RE research has made since 1992. Based on a search in the Scopus digital library, we reportfrom an analysis of peer-reviewed systematic literature reviews and mapping studies to showcase majorareas of RE research that use methods from the Empirical Software Engineering paradigm. We summarizeprior empirical research in RE and introduce the contributors to this special issue on empirical researchmethodologies and studies in RE\n\n2. Research in software engineering: an analysis of the literature\nIn this paper, we examine the state of software engineering (SE) research from the point of view of the following research questions: 1. What topics do SE researchers address? 2. What research approaches do SE researchers use? 3. What research methods do SE researchers use? 4. On what reference disciplines does SE research depend? 5. At what levels of analysis do SE researchers conduct research? To answer those questions, we examined 369 papers in six leading research journals in the SE field, answering those research questions for each paper. From that examination, we conclude that SE research is diverse regarding topic, narrow regarding research approach and method, inwardly-focused regarding reference discipline, and technically focused (as opposed to behaviorally focused) regarding level of analysis. We pass no judgment on the SE field as a result of these findings. Instead, we present them as groundwork for future SE research efforts\n\n3. Support mechanisms to conduct empirical studies in software engineering: a systematic mapping study\nContext: Empirical studies are gaining recognition in the Software Engineering (SE) research community, allowing improved quality of research and accelerating the adoption of new technologies in the software market. However, empirical studies in this area are still limited. In order to foster empirical research in SE, it is essential to understand the resources available to aid these studies. Goal: Identify support mechanisms (methodology, tool, guideline, process, etc.) used to conduct empirical studies in the Empirical Software Engineering (ESE) community. Method: We performed a systematic mapping study that included all full papers published at EASE, ESEM and ESEJ since their first editions. Were selected 891 studies between 1996 and 2013. Results: A total of 375 support mechanisms were identified. We provide the full list of mechanisms and the strategies that uses them. Despite this, we identified a high number of studies that do not cite any mechanism to support their empirical strategies: 433 studies (48%). Experiment is the strategy that has more resources to support their activities. And guideline was the most used type of mechanism. Moreover we observed that the most mechanisms used as reference to empirical studies are not specific to SE area. And some mechanisms were used only in specific activities of empirical research, such as statistical and qualitative data analysis. Experiment and case studies are the strategies most applied. Conclusions: The use of empirical methods in SE has increased over the years. Despite this, many studies did not apply these methods and do not cite any resource to guide their research. Therefore, the list of support mechanisms, where and how they were applied is a major asset to the SE community. Such asset can encourage empirical studies aiding the choice regarding which strategies and mechanisms to use in a research, as well as pointing out examples where they were used, mainly to novice researchers. We also identified new perspectives and gaps that foster other research for the improvement of empirical research in this area.\n\n4. An Analysis of Empirical Requirements Engineering Survey Data\nThe gap between research and practice in requirements engineering is immense. To understand practice and the reasons for this gap, empirical evidence about requirements engineering practice is needed. In the last ten years a number of empirical studies have been conducted to gather such data. This chapter gives an overview focusing on broad surveys. The aim of this overview is to understand the following three issues: (1) what kind of questions can and should we ask to understand practice, (2) what evidence do we have about practice, (3) what further evidence do we need about practice. To further illustrate the issues, we provide findings of new studies conducted by the authors in Germany and Australia. Altogether this chapter aims at establishing a basis for further empirical research on requirements engineering\n\n5. Empirical Strategies in Software Engineering Research: A Literature Survey\nContext: The Software Engineering (SE) research continues to gain strength and interest for researchers considering the need to apply rigor and scientific validity to research results. Objective: Establishing an overview of the topic through a classification scheme of publications and structure the field of interest. Method: We conducted a Systematic Mapping Study, including articles published until 2019, that report at least one study of empirical strategies in SE. Results: 80 initial sets of studies were selected and analyzed, identifying: i) empirical strategy type used and ii) Software Engineering hypotheses types used. Also, 20 papers of the set of studies for mapping were selected and analyzed, identifying 17 empirical strategies and 11 main characteristics to address the empirical research inception in SE. Conclusions: We corroborate that the selection of an empirical strategy in Software Engineering research depends on the nature and scope of the research and on the resources that the researcher has at that moment, in addition to the degree of scientific and methodological knowledge that he has to carry out an empirical study. It is necessary to continue studying in-depth the behavior and nature of the empirical strategies in Software Engineering research that allows strengthening the scientific taxonomy in SE, besides walking towards the automation of the experimental process.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of software engineering (SE), empirical research has made significant strides, particularly in the requirements engineering (RE) field, where it has been instrumental in gaining knowledge about RE phenomena and the validity of research results (1). A systematic mapping study highlights the diversity of SE research topics and the narrow focus of research methods, suggesting a need for broadening the methodological scope and interdisciplinary references (2). Meanwhile, a systematic mapping study on support mechanisms for conducting empirical studies in SE reveals a high number of studies that do not utilize any such mechanisms, despite an increase in empirical methods in SE over the years. This underscores the necessity for better guidance in applying empirical methods and the need for a comprehensive list of support mechanisms, especially for novice researchers (3). Empirical surveys in RE have been conducted to bridge the gap between research and practice, aiming to understand the types of questions that should be asked and the evidence needed to understand SE practices (4). Lastly, a literature survey on empirical strategies in SE research categorizes and analyzes empirical strategies and hypotheses types, highlighting the dependency of empirical strategy selection on the research's nature, scope, and available resources (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the importance of empirical research in advancing SE knowledge, the need for methodological diversity and support, and the ongoing effort to understand and bridge the gap between SE research and practice.",

The type of evidence produced by empirical software engineers\nThis paper reports on the research published between the years 1997 and 2003 inclusive in the journal of Empirical Software Engineering, drawing on the taxonomy developed by Glass et al. in [3]. We found that the research was somewhat narrow in topic with about half the papers focusing on measurement/metrics, review and inspection; that researchers were almost as interested in formulating as in evaluating; that hypothesis testing and laboratory experiments dominated evaluations; that research was not very likely to focus on people and extremely unlikely to refer to other disciplines. We discuss our findings in the context of making empirical software engineering more relevant to practitioners.\n\n5.

        "inference": " Empirical research in software engineering (SE) has evolved with various methodologies to bridge the gap between theory and practice, as evidenced by numerous studies over the years. A systematic mapping study revealed a multitude of support mechanisms available to researchers, yet a significant number of studies fail to utilize these resources, highlighting a need for better guidance in empirical methods (2). Requirements engineering (RE) is a key area where empirical studies have been instrumental in understanding practices and validating research results, with broad surveys and statistical and qualitative data analysis being commonly employed (3). However, the type of evidence produced by empirical SE researchers tends to be narrow in scope, with a focus on measurement and evaluation, and there is a call for broader topics and a greater consideration of human factors and interdisciplinary references (4). The selection of empirical strategies in SE research is context-dependent and resource-constrained, with a variety of strategies available, including laboratory experiments and hypothesis testing, but the need for automation in the experimental process indicates a developing field (5). Despite these advancements, it is crucial to continue refining empirical methodologies in SE to enhance the scientific rigor and relevance of research findings to practitioners (1, 5).\n\n",

And some mechanisms were used only in specific activities of empirical research, such as statistical and qualitative data analysis. Experiment and case studies are the strategies most applied. Conclusions: The use of empirical methods in SE has increased over the years. Despite this, many studies did not apply these methods and do not cite any resource to guide their research. Therefore, the list of support mechanisms, where and how they were applied is a major asset to the SE community. Such asset can encourage empirical studies aiding the choice regarding which strategies and mechanisms to use in a research, as well as pointing out examples where they were used, mainly to novice researchers. We also identified new perspectives and gaps that foster other research for the improvement of empirical research in this area.\n\n3. An Analysis of Empirical Requirements Engineering Survey Data\nThe gap between research and practice in requirements engineering is immense. To understand practice and the reasons for this gap, empirical evidence about requirements engineering practice is needed. In the last ten years a number of empirical studies have been conducted to gather such data. This chapter gives an overview focusing on broad surveys. The aim of this overview is to understand the following three issues: (1) what kind of questions can and should we ask to understand practice, (2) what evidence do we have about practice, (3) what further evidence do we need about practice. To further illustrate the issues, we provide findings of new studies conducted by the authors in Germany and Australia. Altogether this chapter aims at establishing a basis for further empirical research on requirements engineering\n\n4. The type of evidence produced by empirical software engineers\nThis paper reports on the research published between the years 1997 and 2003 inclusive in the journal of Empirical Software Engineering, drawing on the taxonomy developed by Glass et al. in [3]. We found that the research was somewhat narrow in topic with about half the papers focusing on measurement/metrics, review and inspection; that researchers were almost as interested in formulating as in evaluating; that hypothesis testing and laboratory experiments dominated evaluations; that research was not very likely to focus on people and extremely unlikely to refer to other disciplines. We discuss our findings in the context of making empirical software engineering more relevant to practitioners.\n\n5. Empirical Strategies in Software Engineering Research: A Literature Survey\nContext: The Software Engineering (SE) research continues to gain strength and interest for researchers considering the need to apply rigor and scientific validity to research results. Objective: Establishing an overview of the topic through a classification scheme of publications and structure the field of interest. Method: We conducted a Systematic Mapping Study, including articles published until 2019, that report at least one study of empirical strategies in SE. Results: 80 initial sets of studies were selected and analyzed, identifying: i) empirical strategy type used and ii) Software Engineering hypotheses types used. Also, 20 papers of the set of studies for mapping were selected and analyzed, identifying 17 empirical strategies and 11 main characteristics to address the empirical research inception in SE. Conclusions: We corroborate that the selection of an empirical strategy in Software Engineering research depends on the nature and scope of the research and on the resources that the researcher has at that moment, in addition to the degree of scientific and methodological knowledge that he has to carry out an empirical study. It is necessary to continue studying in-depth the behavior and nature of the empirical strategies in Software Engineering research that allows strengthening the scientific taxonomy in SE, besides walking towards the automation of the experimental process.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " Empirical research in software engineering (SE) has become increasingly recognized for its role in enhancing the quality of research and facilitate the adoption of new technologies in the software market, yet it remains underutilized in many studies (2). A systematic mapping study reveals a wealth of support mechanisms available to researchers, such as methodologies, tools, and guidelines, but also highlights that nearly half of the studies does not reference any such resources, indicating a gap in the application of empirical methods (2). In the realm of requirements engineering (RE), empirical studies have been instrumental in bridging the gap between research and practice, but there is a need for more evidence-based research to understand practices and address the disconnect (3). The types of evidence produced by empirical SE researchers are often narrow in scope, with a focus on measurement, review, and inspection, and there is a call for more diverse research that includes human factors and interdisciplinary references (4). Furthermore, the choice of empirical strategies in SE research depends on the study's nature and the researcher's methodological knowledge, with a need for more studies mapping out these strategies to establish a more robust scientific taxonomy (5). Overall, empirical research in SE is critical for advancing the field, and the identification and application of appropriate support mechanisms, as well as the development of a broadened research agenda, are essential for realizing its full potential (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). \n\n",

However, empirical studies in this area are still limited. In order to foster empirical research in SE, it is essential to understand the resources available to aid these studies.

Research in software engineering: an analysis of the literature\nIn this paper, we examine the state of software engineering (SE) research from the point of view of the following research questions: 1. What topics do SE researchers address? 2. What research approaches do SE researchers use? 3. What research methods do SE researchers use? 4. On what reference disciplines does SE research depend? 5. At what levels of analysis do SE researchers conduct research? To answer those questions, we examined 369 papers in six leading research journals in the SE field, answering those research questions for each paper. From that examination, we conclude that SE research is diverse regarding topic, narrow regarding research approach and method, inwardly-focused regarding reference discipline, and technically focused (as opposed to behaviorally focused) regarding level of analysis. We pass no judgment on the SE field as a result of these findings. Instead, we present them as groundwork for future SE research efforts\n\n3.

        "inference": " Empirical research in software engineering (SE) has evolved with various methodologies, each contributing uniquely to the field's understanding and advancement. Systematic mapping studies are a prevalent approach, providing a broad overview of research topics and the empirical strategies used to explore them (2, 4). These studies help identify major areas where empirical research is conducted and highlight the need for methodological diversity (3). The use of experimental and observational methods is common, with a tendency towards laboratory experiments and statistical analysis to evaluate hypotheses (1, 5). However, the integration of qualitative methods and the consideration of human factors in empirical studies are relatively underutilized, despite their potential to enhance the rigor and relevance of research findings (5). Furthermore, the availability of support mechanisms, such as methodologies, tools, and guidelines, is crucial for guiding empirical studies, yet a significant number of studies fail to cite or utilize these resources, indicating a gap in the application of empirical methodologies in SE (4). The selection of empirical strategies in SE research depends on the nature of the research and the resources available to the researcher, highlighting the importance of continuing to study and refine empirical methods to foster scientific inception and automation in the field (1). Overall, the empirical research methodologies used in SE reflect a balanced mixture of quantitative and qualitative approaches, with an ongoing need to balance the rigor of scientific validation with the practical applicability of research results (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n\n",

Empirical Strategies in Software Engineering Research: A Literature Survey\nContext: The Software Engineering (SE) research continues to gain strength and interest for researchers considering the need to apply rigor and scientific validity to research results. Objective: Establishing an overview of the topic through a classification scheme of publications and structure the field of interest. Method: We conducted a Systematic Mapping Study, including articles published until 2019, that report at least one study of empirical strategies in SE. Results: 80 initial sets of studies were selected and analyzed, identifying: i) empirical strategy type used and ii) Software Engineering hypotheses types used. Also, 20 papers of the set of studies for mapping were selected and analyzed, identifying 17 empirical strategies and 11 main characteristics to address the empirical research inception in SE. Conclusions: We corroborate that the selection of an empirical strategy in Software Engineering research depends on the nature and scope of the research and on the resources that the researcher has at that moment, in addition to the degree of scientific and methodological knowledge that he has to carry out an empirical study. It is necessary to continue studying in-depth the behavior and nature of the empirical strategies in Software Engineering research that allows strengthening the scientific taxonomy in SE, besides walking towards the automation of the experimental process.\n\n2. Research in software engineering: an analysis of the literature\nIn this paper, we examine the state of software engineering (SE) research from the point of view of the following research questions: 1. What topics do SE researchers address? 2. What research approaches do SE researchers use? 3. What research methods do SE researchers use? 4. On what reference disciplines does SE research depend? 5. At what levels of analysis do SE researchers conduct research? To answer those questions, we examined 369 papers in six leading research journals in the SE field, answering those research questions for each paper. From that examination, we conclude that SE research is diverse regarding topic, narrow regarding research approach and method, inwardly-focused regarding reference discipline, and technically focused (as opposed to behaviorally focused) regarding level of analysis. We pass no judgment on the SE field as a result of these findings. Instead, we present them as groundwork for future SE research efforts\n\n3. Empirical research methodologies and studies in Requirements Engineering: How far did we come?\nSince the inception of the RE conference series (1992), both researchers and practitioners in the RE com-munity have acknowledged the significance of empirical evaluation as an instrument to gain knowledgeabout various aspects of RE phenomena and the validity of our research results. A significant number ofempirical studies have been conducted in the search for knowledge about RE problems as well as evidenceof successful and less successful application of proposed solutions. This editorial presents the progressempirical RE research has made since 1992. Based on a search in the Scopus digital library, we reportfrom an analysis of peer-reviewed systematic literature reviews and mapping studies to showcase majorareas of RE research that use methods from the Empirical Software Engineering paradigm. We summarizeprior empirical research in RE and introduce the contributors to this special issue on empirical researchmethodologies and studies in RE\n\n4. Support mechanisms to conduct empirical studies in software engineering: a systematic mapping study\nContext: Empirical studies are gaining recognition in the Software Engineering (SE) research community, allowing improved quality of research and accelerating the adoption of new technologies in the software market. However, empirical studies in this area are still limited. In order to foster empirical research in SE, it is essential to understand the resources available to aid these studies. Goal: Identify support mechanisms (methodology, tool, guideline, process, etc.) used to conduct empirical studies in the Empirical Software Engineering (ESE) community. Method: We performed a systematic mapping study that included all full papers published at EASE, ESEM and ESEJ since their first editions. Were selected 891 studies between 1996 and 2013. Results: A total of 375 support mechanisms were identified. We provide the full list of mechanisms and the strategies that uses them. Despite this, we identified a high number of studies that do not cite any mechanism to support their empirical strategies: 433 studies (48%). Experiment is the strategy that has more resources to support their activities. And guideline was the most used type of mechanism. Moreover we observed that the most mechanisms used as reference to empirical studies are not specific to SE area. And some mechanisms were used only in specific activities of empirical research, such as statistical and qualitative data analysis. Experiment and case studies are the strategies most applied. Conclusions: The use of empirical methods in SE has increased over the years. Despite this, many studies did not apply these methods and do not cite any resource to guide their research. Therefore, the list of support mechanisms, where and how they were applied is a major asset to the SE community. Such asset can encourage empirical studies aiding the choice regarding which strategies and mechanisms to use in a research, as well as pointing out examples where they were used, mainly to novice researchers. We also identified new perspectives and gaps that foster other research for the improvement of empirical research in this area.\n\n5. The type of evidence produced by empirical software engineers\nThis paper reports on the research published between the years 1997 and 2003 inclusive in the journal of Empirical Software Engineering, drawing on the taxonomy developed by Glass et al. in [3]. We found that the research was somewhat narrow in topic with about half the papers focusing on measurement/metrics, review and inspection; that researchers were almost as interested in formulating as in evaluating; that hypothesis testing and laboratory experiments dominated evaluations; that research was not very likely to focus on people and extremely unlikely to refer to other disciplines. We discuss our findings in the context of making empirical software engineering more relevant to practitioners.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " Empirical research in software engineering (SE) has become increasingly recognized for its role in enhancing the quality of research and facilitating the adoption of new technologies within the software industry. A systematic mapping study highlights the diversity of topics addressed by SE researchers and the narrow focus of research approaches and methods, suggesting a need for broader perspectives and interdisciplinary references (2). Despite the growing recognition, empirical studies in SE are still limited, and there is a significant gap in the application of empirical methodologies, particularly in requirements engineering (3). Moreover, a substantial number of studies fail to cite any support mechanisms, indicating a lack of methodological rigor and the need for better guidance in empirical methods (4). The types of evidence produced by empirical software engineers tend to be narrow in scope, with an emphasis on measurement, metrics, review, and inspection, and there is a prevalence of hypothesis testing and laboratory experiments, although there is a growing interest in people-centric approaches and interdisciplinary references (5). To bridge these gaps, it is crucial to continue mapping empirical strategies and support mechanisms, promoting cross-disciplinary collaborations, and providing comprehensive methodological resources for researchers (1, 3, 4).\n\n",

Empirical Strategies in Software Engineering Research: A Literature Survey\nContext: The Software Engineering (SE) research continues to gain strength and interest for researchers considering the need to apply rigor and scientific validity to research results. Objective: Establishing an overview of the topic through a classification scheme of publications and structure the field of interest. Method: We conducted a Systematic Mapping Study, including articles published until 2019, that report at least one study of empirical strategies in SE. Results: 80 initial sets of studies were selected and analyzed, identifying: i) empirical strategy type used and ii) Software Engineering hypotheses types used. Also, 20 papers of the set of studies for mapping were selected and analyzed, identifying 17 empirical strategies and 11 main characteristics to address the empirical research inception in SE. Conclusions: We corroborate that the selection of an empirical strategy in Software Engineering research depends on the nature and scope of the research and on the resources that the researcher has at that moment, in addition to the degree of scientific and methodological knowledge that he has to carry out an empirical study. It is necessary to continue studying in-depth the behavior and nature of the empirical strategies in Software Engineering research that allows strengthening the scientific taxonomy in SE, besides walking towards the automation of the experimental process.\n\n5. Has twenty-five years of empirical software engineering made a difference?\nOur activities in software engineering typically fall into one of three categories, (1) to invent new phenomena, (2) to understand existing phenomena, and (3) to facilitate inspirational education. This paper explores the place of empirical software engineering in the first two of these activities. In this exploration evidence is drawn from the empirical literature in the areas of software inspections and software cost modelling and estimation. This research is then compared with the literature published in the Journal of Empirical Software Engineering. This evidence throws light on aspects of theory derivation, experimental methods and analysis, and also the challenges that we face as empirical software engineering evolves into the future.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " Empirical research in software engineering has evolved to incorporate a variety of methodologies, each contributing uniquely to the field's understanding and relevance. Quantitative and qualitative approaches are commonly used to evaluate hypotheses and understand software engineering phenomena, with hypothesis testing and laboratory experiments being particularly prevalent (1, 3). Systematic mapping studies have been employed to summarize and synthesize empirical research in requirements engineering, highlighting major areas where empirical methods are applied and identifying gaps in the field (2). Despite the recognition of the importance of empirical evaluations, critiques of the quantity and quality of these studies persist, suggesting a need for improved soundness in empirical evaluations as evidenced by the ICSE conference's proceedings (3). A systematic mapping study also revealed a variety of empirical strategies, emphasizing that the selection of these strategies depends on the research's nature, scope, and available resources, as well as the researcher's methodological knowledge (4). Finally, reflecting on the field's impact, a historical analysis of software inspections and cost modeling indicates that empirical software engineering has made a significant difference in understanding and inventing new software engineering phenomena, highlighting the importance of continuing to refine methodologies and address the challenges faced in theoretical derivation and experimental analysis (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the diversity and complexity of empirical research in software engineering, with a clear need for continued methodological refinement and application to enhance practical relevance.\n\n",

        "inference": " Empirical research in software engineering (SE) has evolved to address practical challenges and enhance theory development, but it faces challenges in its application and methodology (1, 3, 5). While empirical studies have been prevalent in understanding SE phenomena, such as measurement and metrics, review, and inspection, there is a tendency for researchers to focus more on formulating than evaluating, with hypothesis testing and laboratory experiments dominating (1). The narrow focus of research topics and the lack of referencing to other disciplines indicate a potential disconnect from practitioner needs, suggesting a gap that empirical SE research could bridge to increase relevance (1). In requirements engineering (RE), empirical research has advanced significantly, with a growing number of studies referring to established SE paradigms, although there is room for improvement in the soundness of these evaluations (2). The quantity of empirical evaluations at prominent SE conferences has increased over time, yet the need for rigor and scientific validity in these evaluations remains prominent (3). Literature surveys provide a framework for empirical strategies in SE, highlighting the dependency of choosing an empirical strategy on the research's nature, scope, and available resources, as well as the researcher's methodological knowledge (4). Furthermore, long-term empirical studies have contributed to understanding existing phenomena and inventing new ones, but the process of theory derivation and experimental methods and analysis requires continued examination to ensure the scientific taxonomy in SE is robust (5). Collectively, these themes underscore the importance of empirical research in advancing SE and the necessity for methodological diversity and rigor to better serve both academic and practical applications (1-5).\n\n",

Facilitating reproducible research through direct connection of data analysis with manuscript preparation: StatTag for connecting statistical software to Microsoft Word\nAbstract  Objectives To enhance reproducible research by creating a broadly accessible, free, open-source software tool for connecting Microsoft Word to statistical programs (R/R Markdown, Python, SAS, Stata) so that results may be automatically updated in a manuscript.   Materials and Methods We developed StatTag for Windows as a Microsoft Word plug-in using C# and for macOS as a native application using Objective-C. Source code is available under the MIT license at https://github.com/stattag.   Results StatTag links analysis file(s) (R/R Markdown, SAS, Stata, or Python) and a Word document, invokes the statistical program(s) to obtain results, and embeds selected output in the document. StatTag can accommodate multiple statistical programs with a single document and features an interface to view, edit, and rerun statistical code directly from Word.   Discussion and Conclusion StatTag may facilitate reproducibility within increasingly multidisciplinary research teams, improve research transparency through review and publication, and complement data-sharing initiatives.\n\n3. An Invitation to Teaching Reproducible Research: Lessons from a Symposium\nABSTRACT This article synthesizes ideas that emerged over the course of a 10-week symposium titled \u201cTeaching Reproducible Research: Educational Outcomes\u201d https://www.projecttier.org/fellowships-and-workshops/2021-spring-symposium that took place in the spring of 2021. The speakers included one linguist, three political scientists, seven psychologists, and three statisticians; about half of them were based in the United States and about half in the United Kingdom. The symposium focused on a particular form of reproducibility\u2014namely computational reproducibility\u2014and the paper begins with an exposition of what computational reproducibility is and how it can be achieved. Drawing on talks by the speakers and comments from participants, the paper then enumerates several reasons for which learning reproducible research methods enhance the education of college and university students; the benefits have partly to do with developing computational skills that prepare students for future education and employment, but they also have to do with their intellectual development more broadly. The article also distills insights from the symposium about practical strategies instructors can adopt to integrate reproducibility into their teaching, as well as to promote the practice among colleagues and throughout departmental curricula. The conceptual framework about the meaning and purposes of teaching reproducibility, and the practical guidance about how to get started, add up to an invitation to instructors to explore the potential for introducing reproducibility in their classes and research supervision.\n\n4. Using Jupyter for Reproducible Scientific Workflows\nLiterate computing has emerged as an important tool for computational studies and open science, with growing folklore of best practices. In this work, we report two case studies\u2014one in computational magnetism and another in computational mathematics\u2014where domain-specific software was exposed to the Jupyter environment. This enables high level control of simulations and computation, interactive exploration of computational results, batch processing on HPC resources, and reproducible workflow documentation in Jupyter notebooks. In the first study, Ubermag drives existing computational micromagnetics software through a domain-specific language embedded in Python. In the second study, a dedicated Jupyter kernel interfaces with the GAP system for computational discrete algebra and its dedicated programming language. In light of these case studies, we discuss the benefits of this approach, including progress toward more reproducible and reusable research results and outputs, notably through the use of infrastructure such as JupyterHub and Binder.\n\n5. Binder 2.0 - Reproducible, interactive, sharable environments for science at scale\nBinder is an open source web service that lets users create sharable, interactive, reproducible environments in the cloud. It is powered by other core projects in the open source ecosystem, including JupyterHub and Kubernetes for managing cloud resources. Binder works with pre-existing workflows in the analytics community, aiming to create interactive versions of repositories that exist on sites like GitHub with minimal extra effort needed. This paper details several of the design decisions and goals that went into the development of the current generation of Binder.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The methodologies employed across the five studies contribute to the overarching goal of enhancing computational reproducibility through various interrelated approaches. The Open Science Framework (OSF) provides a comprehensive, web-based platform for managing research workflows, facilitating easy sharing and discovery of data and code (1). Similarly, StatTag leverages the power of statistical software within Microsoft Word, enabling authors to update results directly within their manuscripts, thus promoting transparency and reproducibility (2). This is complemented by the symposium on teaching reproducible research, which emphasizes the educational importance of reproducibility and provides practical strategies for instructors to integrate these methods into their teaching, fostering computational skills and intellectual development among students (3). The use of Jupyter for reproducible scientific workflows is highlighted in two case studies, demonstrating the utility of domain-specific software within a Jupyter environment for controlling simulations and computing, and the potential for interactive exploration, batch processing, and reusable research outputs (4). Lastly, Binder 2.0 offers a cloud-based solution that creates interactive, reproducible environments for science at scale, utilizing pre-existing workflows and minimal additional effort, making it accessible to a broad audience (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the necessity of integrating user-friendly, cloud-based tools with educational initiatives to achieve consistent reproducibility across research workflows (1-5).\n\n",

Evolving Understanding of Antarctic Ice\u2010Sheet Physics and Ambiguity in Probabilistic Sea\u2010Level Projections\nMechanisms such as ice\u2010shelf hydrofracturing and ice\u2010cliff collapse may rapidly increase discharge from marine\u2010based ice sheets. Here, we link a probabilistic framework for sea\u2010level projections to a small ensemble of Antarctic ice\u2010sheet (AIS) simulations incorporating these physical processes to explore their influence on global\u2010mean sea\u2010level (GMSL) and relative sea\u2010level (RSL). We compare the new projections to past results using expert assessment and structured expert elicitation about AIS changes. Under high greenhouse gas emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP] 8.5), median projected 21st century GMSL rise increases from 79 to 146 cm. Without protective measures, revised median RSL projections would by 2100 submerge land currently home to 153 million people, an increase of 44 million. The use of a physical model, rather than simple parameterizations assuming constant acceleration of ice loss, increases forcing sensitivity: overlap between the central 90% of simulations for 2100 for RCP 8.5 (93\u2013243 cm) and RCP 2.6 (26\u201398 cm) is minimal. By 2300, the gap between median GMSL estimates for RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6 reaches >10 m, with median RSL projections for RCP 8.5 jeopardizing land now occupied by 950 million people (versus 167 million for RCP 2.6). The minimal correlation between the contribution of AIS to GMSL by 2050 and that in 2100 and beyond implies current sea\u2010level observations cannot exclude future extreme outcomes. The sensitivity of post\u20102050 projections to deeply uncertain physics highlights the need for robust decision and adaptive management frameworks.\n\n2. Uncertainty in Sea Level Rise Projections Due to the Dependence Between Contributors\nSea level rises at an accelerating pace threatening coastal communities all over the world. In this context sea level projections are key tools to help risk mitigation and adaptation. Projections are often made using models of the main contributors to sea level rise (e.g., thermal expansion, glaciers, and ice sheets). To obtain the total sea level these contributions are added; therefore, the uncertainty of total sea level depends on the correlation between the uncertainties of the contributors. This fact is important to understand the differences in the uncertainty of sea level projections from different methods. Using two process\u2010based models to project sea level for the 21st century, we show how to model the correlation structure and its time dependence. In these models the correlation primarily arises from uncertainty of future global mean surface temperature that correlates with almost all contributors. Assuming that sea level contributors are independent of each other, an assumption made in many sea level projections underestimates the uncertainty in sea level projections. As a result, high\u2010end low probability events that are important for decision making are underestimated. The uncertainty in the strength of the dependence between contributors is also explored. New dependence relations between the uncertainty of dynamical processes and surface mass balance in glaciers and ice sheets are introduced in our model. Total sea level uncertainty is found to be as sensitive to the dependence between contributors as to uncertainty in certain individual contributors like thermal expansion and Greenland ice sheet.\n\n3. A probabilistic approach to 21st century regional sea-level projections using RCP and High-end scenarios\nSea-level change is an integrated climate system response due to changes in radiative forcing, anthropogenic land-water use and land-motion. Projecting sea-level at a global and regional scale requires a subset of projections - one for each sea-level component given a particular climate-change scenario. We construct relative sealevel projections through the 21st century for RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5 and High-end (RCP 8.5 with increased ice-sheet contribution) scenarios by aggregating spatial projections of individual sea-level components in a probabilistic manner. Most of the global oceans adhere to the projected global average sea level change within 5 cm throughout the century for all scenarios; however coastal regions experience localised effects due to the non-uniform spatial patterns of individual components. This can result in local projections that are 10\u2032s of centimetres different from the global average by 2100. Early in the century, RSL projections are consistent across all scenarios, however from the middle of the century the patterns of RSL for RCP scenarios deviate from the High-end where the contribution from Antarctica dominates. Similarly, the uncertainty in projected sea-level is dominated by an uncertain Antarctic fate. We also explore the effect upon projections of, treating CMIP5 model ensembles as normally distributed when they might not be, correcting CMIP5 model output for internal variability using different polynomials and using different unloading patterns of ice for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets\n\n4. Sea level rise projections for northern Europe under RCP8.5\nSea level rise poses a significant threat to coastal communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Sea level rise is not uniform globally but is affected by a range of regional factors. In this study, we calculate regional projections of 21st century sea level rise in northern Europe, focusing on the British Isles, the Baltic Sea, and the North Sea. The input to the regional sea level projection is a probabilistic projection of the major components of the global sea level budget. Local sea level rise is partly compensated by vertical land movement from glacial isostatic adjustment. We explore the uncertainties beyond the likely range provided by the IPCC, including the risk and potential rate of marine ice sheet collapse. Our median 21st century relative sea level rise projection is 0.8 m near London and Hamburg, with a relative sea level drop of 0.1 m in the Bay of Bothnia (near Oulu, Finland). Considerable uncertainties remain in both the sea level budget and in the regional expression of sea level rise. The greatest uncertainties are associated with Antarctic ice loss, and uncertainties are skewed towards higher values, with the 95th percentile being characterized by an additional 0.9 m sea level rise above median projections.\n\n5. Sea-level projections representing the deeply uncertain contribution of the West Antarctic ice sheet\nAbstractThere is a growing awareness that uncertainties surrounding future sea-level projections may be much larger than typically perceived. Recently published projections appear widely divergent and highly sensitive to non-trivial model choices. Moreover, the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) may be much less stable than previous believed, enabling a rapid disintegration. Here, we present a set of probabilistic sea-level projections that approximates the deeply uncertain WAIS contributions. The projections aim to inform robust decisions by clarifying the sensitivity to non-trivial or controversial assumptions. We show that the deeply uncertain WAIS contribution can dominate other uncertainties within decades. These deep uncertainties call for the development of robust adaptive strategies. These decision-making needs, in turn, require mission-oriented basic science, for example about potential signposts and the maximum rate of WAIS-induced sea-level changes.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The methodologies employed in the exploration of global mean sea level rise projections through the lens of Antarctic ice sheet physics exhibit a range of approaches to incorporate the complex and uncertain nature of sea-level changes. The first study employs a probabilistic framework, linking it to a small ensemble of Antarctic ice-sheet simulations to account for physical processes like hydrofracturing and ice-cliff collapse, revealing a significant increase in projected GMSL rise under high greenhouse gas emissions (RCP 8.5) (1). Similarly, the second paper uses process-based models to project sea level and highlights the importance of the correlation between contributors, emphasizing the underestimation of high-end low probability events in sea-level projections when assuming independent contributors (2). A third study constructs regional sea-level projections by aggregating spatial projections of individual sea-level components in a probabilistic manner, emphasizing the localized effects in coastal regions and the dominance of Antarctic fate in global sea-level change (3). The fourth paper also utilizes a probabilistic approach, considering local sea-level rise and the compensation of local vertical land movement, and explores uncertainties in the risk and potential rate of marine ice sheet collapse (4). Lastly, the fifth study presents probabilistic sea-level projections that reflect the deeply uncertain contribution of the West Antarctic ice sheet, aiming to inform robust decisions by clarifying the sensitivity to non-trivial assumptions (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the complexity of sea-level projections, the importance of probabilistic frameworks, and the need for adaptive strategies in response to the profound uncertainties surrounding GMSL rise.",

        "inference": " Recent studies have highlighted the significant challenges in projecting global mean sea level rise (GMSL) due to the complex physics and uncertainties associated with Antarctic ice sheets and glaciers. Probabilistic frameworks have been employed to incorporate the rapid changes in Antarctic ice-shelf hydrofracturing and ice-cliff collapse, which could substantially increase discharge from marine-based ice sheets, leading to a higher GMSL by the end of the century (1). The dependency between contributors to GMSL, such as thermal expansion and ice sheets, is a crucial factor in these projections, with the uncertainty in their future changes being significantly correlated (2). This is particularly true for regions like northern Europe, where the British Isles, the Baltic Sea, and the North Sea are vulnerable to both rising sea levels and regional factors such as glacial isostatic adjustment (4). The uncertainty in these projections is exacerbated by the deeply uncertain future of the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS), which may undergo rapid disintegration, potentially dominating other uncertainties within decades (5). Moreover, the regional distribution of sea-level rise is not uniform, with some areas experiencing significant relative sea-level drops even as others rise (3). These findings underscore the need for robust decision-making frameworks and adaptive management in response to the evolving understanding of ice-sheet physics and the high sensitivity of GMSL projections to model choices and regional factors (1, 3, 5).",

Evolving Understanding of Antarctic Ice\u2010Sheet Physics and Ambiguity in Probabilistic Sea\u2010Level Projections\nMechanisms such as ice\u2010shelf hydrofracturing and ice\u2010cliff collapse may rapidly increase discharge from marine\u2010based ice sheets. Here, we link a probabilistic framework for sea\u2010level projections to a small ensemble of Antarctic ice\u2010sheet (AIS) simulations incorporating these physical processes to explore their influence on global\u2010mean sea\u2010level (GMSL) and relative sea\u2010level (RSL). We compare the new projections to past results using expert assessment and structured expert elicitation about AIS changes. Under high greenhouse gas emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP] 8.5), median projected 21st century GMSL rise increases from 79 to 146 cm. Without protective measures, revised median RSL projections would by 2100 submerge land currently home to 153 million people, an increase of 44 million. The use of a physical model, rather than simple parameterizations assuming constant acceleration of ice loss, increases forcing sensitivity: overlap between the central 90% of simulations for 2100 for RCP 8.5 (93\u2013243 cm) and RCP 2.6 (26\u201398 cm) is minimal. By 2300, the gap between median GMSL estimates for RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6 reaches >10 m, with median RSL projections for RCP 8.5 jeopardizing land now occupied by 950 million people (versus 167 million for RCP 2.6). The minimal correlation between the contribution of AIS to GMSL by 2050 and that in 2100 and beyond implies current sea\u2010level observations cannot exclude future extreme outcomes. The sensitivity of post\u20102050 projections to deeply uncertain physics highlights the need for robust decision and adaptive management frameworks.\n\n2. Uncertainty in Sea Level Rise Projections Due to the Dependence Between Contributors\nSea level rises at an accelerating pace threatening coastal communities all over the world. In this context sea level projections are key tools to help risk mitigation and adaptation. Projections are often made using models of the main contributors to sea level rise (e.g., thermal expansion, glaciers, and ice sheets). To obtain the total sea level these contributions are added; therefore, the uncertainty of total sea level depends on the correlation between the uncertainties of the contributors. This fact is important to understand the differences in the uncertainty of sea level projections from different methods. Using two process\u2010based models to project sea level for the 21st century, we show how to model the correlation structure and its time dependence. In these models the correlation primarily arises from uncertainty of future global mean surface temperature that correlates with almost all contributors. Assuming that sea level contributors are independent of each other, an assumption made in many sea level projections underestimates the uncertainty in sea level projections. As a result, high\u2010end low probability events that are important for decision making are underestimated. The uncertainty in the strength of the dependence between contributors is also explored. New dependence relations between the uncertainty of dynamical processes and surface mass balance in glaciers and ice sheets are introduced in our model. Total sea level uncertainty is found to be as sensitive to the dependence between contributors as to uncertainty in certain individual contributors like thermal expansion and Greenland ice sheet.\n\n3. A probabilistic approach to 21st century regional sea-level projections using RCP and High-end scenarios\nSea-level change is an integrated climate system response due to changes in radiative forcing, anthropogenic land-water use and land-motion. Projecting sea-level at a global and regional scale requires a subset of projections - one for each sea-level component given a particular climate-change scenario. We construct relative sealevel projections through the 21st century for RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5 and High-end (RCP 8.5 with increased ice-sheet contribution) scenarios by aggregating spatial projections of individual sea-level components in a probabilistic manner. Most of the global oceans adhere to the projected global average sea level change within 5 cm throughout the century for all scenarios; however coastal regions experience localised effects due to the non-uniform spatial patterns of individual components. This can result in local projections that are 10\u2032s of centimetres different from the global average by 2100. Early in the century, RSL projections are consistent across all scenarios, however from the middle of the century the patterns of RSL for RCP scenarios deviate from the High-end where the contribution from Antarctica dominates. Similarly, the uncertainty in projected sea-level is dominated by an uncertain Antarctic fate. We also explore the effect upon projections of, treating CMIP5 model ensembles as normally distributed when they might not be, correcting CMIP5 model output for internal variability using different polynomials and using different unloading patterns of ice for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets\n\n4. Sea level rise projections for northern Europe under RCP8.5\nSea level rise poses a significant threat to coastal communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Sea level rise is not uniform globally but is affected by a range of regional factors. In this study, we calculate regional projections of 21st century sea level rise in northern Europe, focusing on the British Isles, the Baltic Sea, and the North Sea. The input to the regional sea level projection is a probabilistic projection of the major components of the global sea level budget. Local sea level rise is partly compensated by vertical land movement from glacial isostatic adjustment. We explore the uncertainties beyond the likely range provided by the IPCC, including the risk and potential rate of marine ice sheet collapse. Our median 21st century relative sea level rise projection is 0.8 m near London and Hamburg, with a relative sea level drop of 0.1 m in the Bay of Bothnia (near Oulu, Finland). Considerable uncertainties remain in both the sea level budget and in the regional expression of sea level rise. The greatest uncertainties are associated with Antarctic ice loss, and uncertainties are skewed towards higher values, with the 95th percentile being characterized by an additional 0.9 m sea level rise above median projections.\n\n5. Sea-level projections representing the deeply uncertain contribution of the West Antarctic ice sheet\nAbstractThere is a growing awareness that uncertainties surrounding future sea-level projections may be much larger than typically perceived. Recently published projections appear widely divergent and highly sensitive to non-trivial model choices. Moreover, the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) may be much less stable than previous believed, enabling a rapid disintegration. Here, we present a set of probabilistic sea-level projections that approximates the deeply uncertain WAIS contributions. The projections aim to inform robust decisions by clarifying the sensitivity to non-trivial or controversial assumptions. We show that the deeply uncertain WAIS contribution can dominate other uncertainties within decades. These deep uncertainties call for the development of robust adaptive strategies. These decision-making needs, in turn, require mission-oriented basic science, for example about potential signposts and the maximum rate of WAIS-induced sea-level changes.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " Recent studies in the field of global mean sea level rise projections have provided a nuanced view of the future, highlighting the significant role of the Antarctic ice sheets and the complexity of sea-level changes. The first paper emphasizes the rapidly increasing discharge from marine-based ice sheets, such as Antarctica, which could lead to a significant increase in global mean sea level rise (GMSL) under high greenhouse gas emission scenarios, with the potential to submerge land currently inhabited by millions (1). The second paper delves into the uncertainty of sea-level projections, pointing out that the dependence between the various contributors to GMSL, particularly the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, can significantly affect the overall projections, with high-end low probability events often underestimated (2). The third paper offers a regional perspective, constructing relative sea-level projections for the British Isles, the Baltic Sea, and the North Sea, emphasizing the importance of considering the non-uniform sea-level rise and the compensation provided by vertical land movement (4). The fourth paper focuses on northern Europe, particularly the British Isles, the Baltic Sea, and the North Sea, and highlights the considerable uncertainties in both global sea level budgets and regional expressions of sea-level rise, with the median projection showing a relative sea level rise of 0.8 m in certain areas (4). Lastly, the fifth paper explores the deeply uncertain contribution of the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) to sea-level projections, suggesting that the WAIS could dominate other uncertainties within decades and calling for robust adaptive strategies in response to these deep uncertainties (5). Together, these studies underscore the need for sophisticated, adaptive management frameworks and ongoing basic science to navigate the profound changes ahead.",

Flexible Quasi-Vertical In-Ga-Zn-O Thin-Film Transistor With 300-nm Channel Length\nIn this letter, we report a flexible Indium-Gallium-Zinc-Oxide quasi-vertical thin-film transistor (QVTFT) with 300-nm channel length, fabricated on a free-standing polyimide foil, using a low-temperature process <;150 \u00b0C. A bilayer lift-off process is used to structure a spacing layer with a tilted sidewall and the drain contact on top of the source electrode. The resulting quasi-vertical profile ensures a good coverage of the successive device layers. The fabricated flexible QVTFT exhibits an ON/OFF current ratio of 104, a threshold voltage of 1.5 V, a maximum transconductance of 0.73 \u03bcS \u03bcm-1, and a total gate capacitance of 76 nF \u03bcm-1. From S-parameter measurements, we extracted a transit frequency of 1.5 MHz. Furthermore, the flexible QVTFT is fully operational when bent to a tensile radius of 5 mm.\n\n2. Flexible InGaZnO TFTs With fmax Above 300 MHz\nIn this letter, the AC performance and influence of bending on flexible IGZO thin-film transistors, exhibiting a maximum oscillation frequency (maximum power gain frequency) ${f}_{\\textsf {max}}$ beyond 300 MHz, are presented. Self-alignment was used to realize TFTs with channel length down to 0.5 $\\mu \\text{m}$ . The layout of these TFTs was optimized for good AC performance. Besides the channel dimensions, this includes ground-signal-ground contact pads. The AC performance of these short channel devices was evaluated by measuring their two port scattering parameters. These measurements were used to extract the unity gain power frequency from the maximum stable gain and the unilateral gain. The two complimentary definitions result in ${f}_{\\textsf {max}}$ values of (304 \u00b1 12) and (398 \u00b1 53) MHz, respectively. Furthermore, the transistor performance is not significantly altered by mechanical strain. Here, ${f}_{\\textsf {max}}$ reduces by 3.6% when a TFT is bent to a tensile radius of 3.5 mm.\n\n3. Flexible Self-Aligned Amorphous InGaZnO Thin-Film Transistors With Submicrometer Channel Length and a Transit Frequency of 135 MHz\nFlexible large area electronics promise to enable new devices such as rollable displays and electronic skins. Radio frequency (RF) applications demand circuits operating in the megahertz regime, which is hard to achieve for electronics fabricated on amorphous and temperature sensitive plastic substrates. Here, we present self-aligned amorphous indium-gallium-zinc oxide-based thin-film transistors (TFTs) fabricated on free-standing plastic foil using fabrication temperatures . Self-alignment by backside illumination between gate and source/drain electrodes was used to realize flexible transistors with a channel length of 0.5 \u03bcm and reduced parasitic capacities. The flexible TFTs exhibit a transit frequency of 135 MHz when operated at 2 V. The device performance is maintained when the TFTs are bent to a tensile radius of 3.5 mm, which makes this technology suitable for flexible RFID tags and AM radios.\n\n4. Flexible In\u2013Ga\u2013Zn\u2013O Thin-Film Transistors With Sub-300-nm Channel Lengths Defined by Two-Photon Direct Laser Writing\nIn this paper, the low-temperature (\u2264150 \u00b0C) fabrication and characterization of flexible indium\u2013gallium\u2013zinc\u2013oxide (IGZO) top-gate thin-film transistors (TFTs) with channel lengths down to 280 nm is presented. Such extremely short channel lengths in flexible IGZO TFTs were realized with a novel manufacturing process combining two-photon direct laser writing (DLW) photolithography with Ti/Au/Ti source/drain e-beam evaporation and liftoff. The resulting flexible IGZO TFTs exhibit a saturation field-effect mobility of 1.1 cm $^{\\textsf {2}}\\cdot \\textsf {V}^{-\\textsf {1}}\\cdot \\text {s}^{-\\textsf {1}}$  and a threshold voltage of 3 V. Thanks to the short channel lengths (280 nm) and the small gate to source/drain overlap ( $5.2~\\mu \\text{m}$ ), the TFTs yield a transit frequency of 80 MHz (at 8.5-V gate\u2013source voltage) extracted from the measured S-parameters. Furthermore, the devices are fully functional when wrapped around a cylindrical rod with 6-mm radius, corresponding to 0.4% tensile strain in the TFT channel. These results demonstrate a new methodology to realize entirely flexible nanostructures and prove its suitability for the fabrication of short-channel transistors on polymer substrates for future wearable communication electronics.\n\n5. Flexible Self-Aligned Double-Gate IGZO TFT\nIn this letter, flexible double-gate (DG) thin-film transistors (TFTs) based on InGaZnO4 and fabricated on free standing plastic foil, using self-alignment (SA) are presented. The usage of transparent indium-tin-oxide instead of opaque metals enables SA of source-, drain-, and top-gate contacts. Hence, all layers, which can cause parasitic capacitances, are structured by SA. Compared with bottom-gate reference TFTs fabricated on the same substrate, DG TFTs exhibit a by 68% increased transconductance and a subthreshold swing as low as 109 mV/dec decade (-37%). The clockwise hysteresis of the DG TFTs is as small as 5 mV. Because of SA, the source/drain to gate overlaps are as small as \u2248 1 \u03bcm leading to parasitic overlap capacitances of 5.5 fF \u03bcm-1. Therefore a transit frequency of 5.6 MHz is measured on 7.5 \u03bcm long transistors. In addition, the flexible devices stay fully operational when bent to a tensile radius of 6 mm.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The development of high-performance IGZO TFTs has been advanced through various innovative methodologies aimed at enhancing device performance and functionality. A bilayer lift-off process was employed to create a quasi-vertical profile in flexible TFTs with a 300-nm channel length, resulting in high on/off ratios and a substantial threshold voltage (1). Meanwhile, self-alignment techniques were utilized to optimize the layout of TFTs with submicron channel lengths, which led to a significant reduction in parasitic capacitances and achieved high transit frequencies (2, 3). The integration of two-photon direct laser writing with existing fabrication processes allowed for the realization of TFTs with channel lengths down to 280 nm, demonstrating high field-effect mobility and a high transit frequency even under tensile strain (4). Lastly, the implementation of self-aligned double-gate structures in IGZO TFTs not only increased transconductance and reduced subthreshold swings but also ensured the devices' functionality under mechanical stress, with transit frequencies reaching into the megahertz range (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of precise fabrication techniques and layout optimization in the pursuit of high-performance and adaptable IGZO TFTs for flexible electronics applications.\n\n",

Flexible Quasi-Vertical In-Ga-Zn-O Thin-Film Transistor With 300-nm Channel Length\nIn this letter, we report a flexible Indium-Gallium-Zinc-Oxide quasi-vertical thin-film transistor (QVTFT) with 300-nm channel length, fabricated on a free-standing polyimide foil, using a low-temperature process <;150 \u00b0C. A bilayer lift-off process is used to structure a spacing layer with a tilted sidewall and the drain contact on top of the source electrode. The resulting quasi-vertical profile ensures a good coverage of the successive device layers. The fabricated flexible QVTFT exhibits an ON/OFF current ratio of 104, a threshold voltage of 1.5 V, a maximum transconductance of 0.73 \u03bcS \u03bcm-1, and a total gate capacitance of 76 nF \u03bcm-1. From S-parameter measurements, we extracted a transit frequency of 1.5 MHz. Furthermore, the flexible QVTFT is fully operational when bent to a tensile radius of 5 mm.\n\n2. Flexible InGaZnO TFTs With fmax Above 300 MHz\nIn this letter, the AC performance and influence of bending on flexible IGZO thin-film transistors, exhibiting a maximum oscillation frequency (maximum power gain frequency) ${f}_{\\textsf {max}}$ beyond 300 MHz, are presented. Self-alignment was used to realize TFTs with channel length down to 0.5 $\\mu \\text{m}$ . The layout of these TFTs was optimized for good AC performance. Besides the channel dimensions, this includes ground-signal-ground contact pads. The AC performance of these short channel devices was evaluated by measuring their two port scattering parameters. These measurements were used to extract the unity gain power frequency from the maximum stable gain and the unilateral gain. The two complimentary definitions result in ${f}_{\\textsf {max}}$ values of (304 \u00b1 12) and (398 \u00b1 53) MHz, respectively. Furthermore, the transistor performance is not significantly altered by mechanical strain. Here, ${f}_{\\textsf {max}}$ reduces by 3.6% when a TFT is bent to a tensile radius of 3.5 mm.\n\n3. Flexible Self-Aligned Amorphous InGaZnO Thin-Film Transistors With Submicrometer Channel Length and a Transit Frequency of 135 MHz\nFlexible large area electronics promise to enable new devices such as rollable displays and electronic skins. Radio frequency (RF) applications demand circuits operating in the megahertz regime, which is hard to achieve for electronics fabricated on amorphous and temperature sensitive plastic substrates. Here, we present self-aligned amorphous indium-gallium-zinc oxide-based thin-film transistors (TFTs) fabricated on free-standing plastic foil using fabrication temperatures . Self-alignment by backside illumination between gate and source/drain electrodes was used to realize flexible transistors with a channel length of 0.5 \u03bcm and reduced parasitic capacities. The flexible TFTs exhibit a transit frequency of 135 MHz when operated at 2 V. The device performance is maintained when the TFTs are bent to a tensile radius of 3.5 mm, which makes this technology suitable for flexible RFID tags and AM radios.\n\n4. Flexible In\u2013Ga\u2013Zn\u2013O Thin-Film Transistors With Sub-300-nm Channel Lengths Defined by Two-Photon Direct Laser Writing\nIn this paper, the low-temperature (\u2264150 \u00b0C) fabrication and characterization of flexible indium\u2013gallium\u2013zinc\u2013oxide (IGZO) top-gate thin-film transistors (TFTs) with channel lengths down to 280 nm is presented. Such extremely short channel lengths in flexible IGZO TFTs were realized with a novel manufacturing process combining two-photon direct laser writing (DLW) photolithography with Ti/Au/Ti source/drain e-beam evaporation and liftoff. The resulting flexible IGZO TFTs exhibit a saturation field-effect mobility of 1.1 cm $^{\\textsf {2}}\\cdot \\textsf {V}^{-\\textsf {1}}\\cdot \\text {s}^{-\\textsf {1}}$  and a threshold voltage of 3 V. Thanks to the short channel lengths (280 nm) and the small gate to source/drain overlap ( $5.2~\\mu \\text{m}$ ), the TFTs yield a transit frequency of 80 MHz (at 8.5-V gate\u2013source voltage) extracted from the measured S-parameters. Furthermore, the devices are fully functional when wrapped around a cylindrical rod with 6-mm radius, corresponding to 0.4% tensile strain in the TFT channel. These results demonstrate a new methodology to realize entirely flexible nanostructures and prove its suitability for the fabrication of short-channel transistors on polymer substrates for future wearable communication electronics.\n\n5. Flexible Self-Aligned Double-Gate IGZO TFT\nIn this letter, flexible double-gate (DG) thin-film transistors (TFTs) based on InGaZnO4 and fabricated on free standing plastic foil, using self-alignment (SA) are presented. The usage of transparent indium-tin-oxide instead of opaque metals enables SA of source-, drain-, and top-gate contacts. Hence, all layers, which can cause parasitic capacitances, are structured by SA. Compared with bottom-gate reference TFTs fabricated on the same substrate, DG TFTs exhibit a by 68% increased transconductance and a subthreshold swing as low as 109 mV/dec decade (-37%). The clockwise hysteresis of the DG TFTs is as small as 5 mV. Because of SA, the source/drain to gate overlaps are as small as \u2248 1 \u03bcm leading to parasitic overlap capacitances of 5.5 fF \u03bcm-1. Therefore a transit frequency of 5.6 MHz is measured on 7.5 \u03bcm long transistors. In addition, the flexible devices stay fully operational when bent to a tensile radius of 6 mm.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " Recent advancements in the development of high-performance indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) have demonstrated significant progress in achieving high mobility and low threshold voltages, as well as enhancing the devices' flexibility and reliability. A common theme across the research is the pursuit of smaller channel lengths and higher operating frequencies to rival traditional solid-state transistors. For instance, flexible IGZO TFTs with channel lengths as short as 300 nm have been realized, exhibiting impressive on-off ratios and high transit frequencies, even when bent to large radii, indicating strong potential for use in flexible electronics (1, 4). The use of self-alignment techniques has been pivotal in these achievements, allowing for the precise control of device dimensions and the reduction of parasitic capacitances, which is crucial for achieving high operating frequencies and maintaining device performance under mechanical stress (2, 3, 5). Furthermore, the incorporation of advanced manufacturing processes such as two-photon direct laser writing has enabled the creation of TFTs with sub-300-nm channel lengths, significantly reducing the gate-source voltage and achieving high field-effect mobilities (4). The development of flexible double-gate TFTs has also shown promising results, with improved transconductance and reduced subthreshold swings Compared to traditional bottom-gate devices, indicating that the adoption of novel fabrication techniques and layout strategies is vital in realizing high-performance, flexible IGZO TFTs suitable for applications in wireless communication and display technologies (2, 5). Collectively, these studies underscore the importance of dimensional control, process innovation, and structural optimization in the development of high-performance, flexible IGZO TFTs with extensive potential for electronic skin, display, and RFID applications.\n\n",

Effect of Environmental Humidity on Dielectric Charging Effect in RF MEMS Capacitive Switches Based on C\u2013V Properties\nA capacitance-voltage (C- V) model is developed for RF microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) switches at upstate and downstate. The transient capacitance response of the RF MEMS switches at different switch states was measured for different humidity levels. By using the C -V model as well as the voltage shift dependent of trapped charges, the transient trapped charges at different switch states and humidity levels are obtained. Charging models at different switch states are explored in detail. It is shown that the injected charges increase linearly with humidity levels and the internal polarization increases with increasing humidity at downstate. The speed of charge injection at 80% relative humidity (RH) is about ten times faster than that at 20% RH. A measurement of pull-in voltage shifts by C- V sweep cycles at 20% and 80 % RH gives a reasonable evidence. The present model is useful to understand the pull-in voltage shift of the RF MEMS switch.\n\n2. RF MEMS Switches With Enhanced Power-Handling Capabilities\nThis paper reports on the experimental and theoretical characterization of RF microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) switches for high-power applications. First, we investigate the problem of self-actuation due to high RF power and we demonstrate switches that do not self-actuate or catastrophically fail with a measured RF power of up to 5.5 W. Second, the problem of switch stiction to the down state as a function of the applied RF power is also theoretically and experimentally studied. Finally, a novel switch design with a top electrode is introduced and its advantages related to RF power-handling capabilities are presented. By applying this technology, we demonstrate hot-switching measurements with a maximum power of 0.8 W. Our results, backed by theory and measurements, illustrate that careful design can significantly improve the power-handling capabilities of RF MEMS switches.\n\n3. Effects of surface roughness on electromagnetic characteristics of capacitive switches\nThis paper studies the effect of surface roughness on up-state and down-state capacitances of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) capacitive switches. When the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness is 10 nm, the up-state capacitance is approximately 9% higher than the theoretical value. When the metal bridge is driven down, the normalized contact area between the metal bridge and the surface of the dielectric layer is less than 1% if the RMS roughness is larger than 2 nm. Therefore, the down-state capacitance is actually determined by the non-contact part of the metal bridge. The normalized isolation is only 62% for RMS roughness of 10 nm when the hold-down voltage is 30 V. The analysis also shows that the down-state capacitance and the isolation increase with the hold-down voltage. The normalized isolation increases from 58% to 65% when the hold-down voltage increases from 10 V to 60 V for RMS roughness of 10 nm.\n\n4. A zipper RF MEMS tunable capacitor with interdigitated RF and actuation electrodes\nThis paper presents a new RF MEMS tunable capacitor based on the zipper principle and with interdigitated RF and actuation electrodes. The electrode configuration prevents dielectric charging under high actuation voltages. It also increases the capacitance ratio and the tunable analog range. The effect of the residual stress on the capacitance tunability is also investigated. Two devices with different interdigital RF and actuation electrodes are fabricated on an alumina substrate and result in a capacitance ratio around 3.0 (Cmin = 70\u201390 fF, Cmax = 240\u2013270 fF) and with a Q > 100 at 3 GHz. This design can be used in wideband tunable filters and matching networks.\n\n5. High-isolation CPW MEMS shunt switches-part 1: modeling \nThis paper, the first of two parts, presents an electromagnetic model for membrane microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) shunt switches for microwave/millimeter-wave applications. The up-state capacitance can be accurately modeled using three-dimensional static solvers, and full-wave solvers are used to predict the current distribution and inductance of the switch. The loss in the up-state position is equivalent to the coplanar waveguide line loss and is 0.01-0.02 dB at 10-30 GHz for a 2-/spl mu/m-thick Au MEMS shunt switch. It is seen that the capacitance, inductance, and series resistance can be accurately extracted from DC-40 GHz S-parameter measurements. It is also shown that dramatic increase in the down-state isolation (20/sup +/ dB) can be achieved with the choice of the correct LC series resonant frequency of the switch. In part 2 of this paper, the equivalent capacitor-inductor-resistor model is used in the design of tuned high isolation switches at 10 and 30 GHz.\n\n###\n\n",

The experimental and theoretical characterization of RF MEMS switches has been conducted to understand the effects of humidity on dielectric charging and to improve power-handling capabilities (2, 1). The measurement of switch response at different humidity levels has been used to create a capacitance-voltage (C-V) model, which helps in understanding the charging mechanisms at different switch states (1). Similarly, the investigation of surface roughness has been done to characterize the up-state and down-state capacitances, revealing that the contact area between the metal bridge and dielectric layer is significantly reduced due to surface roughness, which affects the down-state capacitance and isolation (3). The zipper principle has been utilized to design capacitive switches with interdigitated RF and actuation electrodes, which not only enhances capacitance ratio and tunable analog range but also addressing the dielectric charging issue (4). Lastly, the development of electromagnetic models for membrane MEMS shunt switches has been done using static and full-wave solvers, extracting accurate capacitance, inductance, and series resistance from S-parameter measurements, thereby achieving high isolation in the down-state (5). These methodologies collectively contribute to the advancement of MEMS switch technology, focusing on improving capacitance characteristics, isolation, and power-handling capabilities.\n\n",

Effect of Environmental Humidity on Dielectric Charging Effect in RF MEMS Capacitive Switches Based on C\u2013V Properties\nA capacitance-voltage (C- V) model is developed for RF microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) switches at upstate and downstate. The transient capacitance response of the RF MEMS switches at different switch states was measured for different humidity levels. By using the C -V model as well as the voltage shift dependent of trapped charges, the transient trapped charges at different switch states and humidity levels are obtained. Charging models at different switch states are explored in detail. It is shown that the injected charges increase linearly with humidity levels and the internal polarization increases with increasing humidity at downstate. The speed of charge injection at 80% relative humidity (RH) is about ten times faster than that at 20% RH. A measurement of pull-in voltage shifts by C- V sweep cycles at 20% and 80 % RH gives a reasonable evidence. The present model is useful to understand the pull-in voltage shift of the RF MEMS switch.\n\n2.

Second, the problem of switch stiction to the down state as a function of the applied RF power is also theoretically and experimentally studied. Finally, a novel switch design with a top electrode is introduced and its advantages related to RF power-handling capabilities are presented. By applying this technology, we demonstrate hot-switching measurements with a maximum power of 0.8 W. Our results, backed by theory and measurements, illustrate that careful design can significantly improve the power-handling capabilities of RF MEMS switches.\n\n3.

A Microinjected 3-Axis Thermal Accelerometer\nA completely new approach for the fabrication of 3-axis thermal accelerometers is presented in this paper. Micromolded polystyrene micro-parts are assembled with polyimide membranes enabling the construction of thermal accelerometers. The use of polymers (polystyrene and polyimide) with low thermal conductivities improves the overall power consumption of the thermal accelerometer and enables a simple and low-cost fabrication process (no clean room infrastructure required). The accelerometer is composed of 4 polystyrene microinjected structural microparts (two identical top parts and two identical central parts) and three polyimide membranes (two identical z-axis membranes and a central membrane). The microinjected parts provide the mechanical support for the active elements that are placed on the membranes (the heater and the temperature sensors). Coupled 3D thermo-electric-fluidic FEM simulations show that current design has a sensitivity of 1.6\u00baC/g in the X-Y directions and 0.2\u00baC/g in the Z direction for a central heater temperature of 300\u00baC.Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia (FCT\n\n2. A Reliable Liquid-Based CMOS MEMS Micro Thermal Convective Accelerometer With Enhanced Sensitivity and Limit of Detection\nIn this paper, a liquid-based micro thermal convective accelerometer (MTCA) is optimized by the Rayleigh number (Ra) based compact model and fabricated using the  $0.35\\mu $  m CMOS MEMS technology. To achieve water-proof performance, the conformal Parylene C coating was adopted as the isolation layer with the accelerated life-testing results of a 9-year-lifetime for liquid-based MTCA. Then, the device performance was characterized considering sensitivity, response time, and noise. Both the theoretical and experimental results demonstrated that fluid with a larger Ra number can provide better performance for the MTCA. More significantly, Ra based model showed its advantage to make a more accurate prediction than the simple linear model to select suitable fluid to enhance the sensitivity and balance the linear range of the device. Accordingly, an alcohol-based MTCA was achieved with a two-order-of magnitude increase in sensitivity (43.8 mV/g) and one-order-of-magnitude decrease in the limit of detection (LOD) ( $61.9~\\mu \\text{g}$ ) compared with the air-based MTCA.

A 2-DOF convective micro accelerometer with a low thermal stress sensing element\nThis paper presents the development of a dual-axis convective microaccelerometer, whose working principle is based on the convective heat transfer and thermoresistive effect of lightly doped silicon. In contrast to the developed convective accelerometer, the sensor utilizes new structures of the sensing element which can reduce at least 90% of the thermally induced stress. By using a numerical method, the dimensions of the sensing chip and of the package are optimized. The sensitivity of the sensor is simulated; other characteristics such as frequency response, shock resistance and the noise problem were investigated. The sensor has been fabricated by a microelectrical mechanical systems (MEMS) process and characterized by experiments.\n\n4. Development of a dual-axis micromachined convective accelerometer with an effective heater geometry\nThis paper describes the design, fabrication and testing of a dual-axis micromachined convective accelerometer with a diamond-shaped heater. Modification of heater geometry is advantageous because it is simple and ensures enhanced sensitivity without constraining device size or operating power. The diamond-shaped heater induces active heat flow and a sharp temperature gradient around the heatertogether these effects provide high sensitivity. When the fabricated convective accelerometer used SF(6) as an enclosed gas medium, its measured sensitivity was 3.5 mV/g when operating power was 7.4 mW and its bandwidth at -3 dB was 25 Hz.

Theoretical Modeling, Numerical Simulations and Experimental Study of Micro Thermal Convective Accelerometers\nWe present a one-dimensional (1D) theoretical model for the design analysis of a micro thermal convective accelerometer (MTCA). Systematical design analysis was conducted on the sensor performance covering the sensor output, sensitivity, and power consumption. The sensor output was further normalized as a function of normalized input acceleration in terms of Rayleigh number R $_{\\mathrm {a}}$  (the product of Grashof number G $_{\\mathrm {r}}$  and Prandtl number P $_{\\mathrm {r}}$ ) for different fluids. A critical Rayleigh number (Rac = 3,000) is founded, for the first time, to determine the boundary between the linear and nonlinear response regime of MTCA. Based on the proposed 1D model, key parameters, including the location of the detectors, sensor length, thin film thickness, cavity height, heater temperature, and fluid types, were optimized to improve sensor performance. Accordingly, a CMOS compatible MTCA was designed and fabricated based on the theoretical analysis, which showed a high sensitivity of 1,289 mV/g. Therefore, this efficient 1D model, one million times faster than CFD simulation, can be a promising tool for the system-level CMOS MEMS design.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of thermal accelerometer performance enhancements, recent methodologies have focused on the development of microfluidic devices using polymers and metals to improve sensitivity and reduce power consumption. The fabrication of a 3-axis thermal accelerometer employing micromolded polystyrene micro-parts and polyimide membranes has been shown to be a cost-effective approach, with simulations indicating high sensitivity and low current consumption (1). Similarly, the optimization of a liquid-based micro thermal convective accelerometer (MTCA) has been achieved through the use of Rayleigh number-based compact models, which have been validated through life-testing and performance characterization, leading to significant sensitivity improvements and noise reduction (2). The design of a 2-DOF convective microaccelerometer with a low thermal stress sensing element has been advanced through numerical methods, which optimized the dimensions of the sensing chip and package, resulting in high sensitivity and enhanced frequency response (3). Another dual-axis micromachined convective accelerometer has been developed with a diamond-shaped heater, which, in conjunction with SF(6) as an enclosed gas medium, has demonstrated high sensitivity and a wide bandwidth (4). Lastly, a theoretical model has been established for the design analysis of MTCA, utilizing Rayleigh number principles to optimize sensor output and sensitivity across various fluid types, with experimental validation supporting the model's accuracy (5). These methodologies collectively contribute to the advancement of thermal accelerometer performance by focusing on material selection, geometry optimization, and theoretical modeling to achieve high sensitivity and improved operating characteristics.\n\n",

Development of a dual-axis micromachined convective accelerometer with an effective heater geometry\nThis paper describes the design, fabrication and testing of a dual-axis micromachined convective accelerometer with a diamond-shaped heater. Modification of heater geometry is advantageous because it is simple and ensures enhanced sensitivity without constraining device size or operating power. The diamond-shaped heater induces active heat flow and a sharp temperature gradient around the heatertogether these effects provide high sensitivity. When the fabricated convective accelerometer used SF(6) as an enclosed gas medium, its measured sensitivity was 3.5 mV/g when operating power was 7.4 mW and its bandwidth at -3 dB was 25 Hz.

Theoretical Modeling, Numerical Simulations and Experimental Study of Micro Thermal Convective Accelerometers\nWe present a one-dimensional (1D) theoretical model for the design analysis of a micro thermal convective accelerometer (MTCA). Systematical design analysis was conducted on the sensor performance covering the sensor output, sensitivity, and power consumption. The sensor output was further normalized as a function of normalized input acceleration in terms of Rayleigh number R $_{\\mathrm {a}}$  (the product of Grashof number G $_{\\mathrm {r}}$  and Prandtl number P $_{\\mathrm {r}}$ ) for different fluids. A critical Rayleigh number (Rac = 3,000) is founded, for the first time, to determine the boundary between the linear and nonlinear response regime of MTCA. Based on the proposed 1D model, key parameters, including the location of the detectors, sensor length, thin film thickness, cavity height, heater temperature, and fluid types, were optimized to improve sensor performance. Accordingly, a CMOS compatible MTCA was designed and fabricated based on the theoretical analysis, which showed a high sensitivity of 1,289 mV/g. Therefore, this efficient 1D model, one million times faster than CFD simulation, can be a promising tool for the system-level CMOS MEMS design.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of thermal accelerometers, recent advancements have been made to enhance their performance through innovative design approaches. The first paper introduces a microinjected 3-axis thermal accelerometer, utilizing polystyrene micro-parts and polyimide membranes, which significantly reduces power consumption and allows for a low-cost fabrication process, with simulations indicating high sensitivity (1.6\u00b0C/g) in the X-Y directions and (0.2\u00b0C/g) in the Z direction at a central heater temperature of 300\u00b0C (1). The second study optimizes a liquid-based micro thermal convective accelerometer (MTCA) using the Rayleigh number, achieving a substantial increase in sensitivity (43.8 mV/g) and a significant decrease in the limit of detection (LOD) (61.9 \u03bcg) by selecting optimal fluids for enhanced sensitivity and balance in the linear range (2021-0092). A third paper presents a 2-DOF convective microaccelerometer with a low thermal stress sensing element, which has been optimized for improved sensitivity and reduced thermally induced stress, demonstrating a high sensitivity and a clear frequency response (3). The fourth paper discusses the design, fabrication, and testing of a dual-axis micromachined convective accelerometer with a diamond-shaped heater, which yielded a sensitivity of 3.5 mV/g and a bandwidth of 25 Hz at 7.4 mW operating power (4). Lastly, the fifth paper provides a theoretical model for designing micro thermal convective accelerometers (MTCA), identifying a critical Rayleigh number for distinguishing between linear and nonlinear response regimes, and proposing key design parameters that lead to a CMOS-compatible MTCA with a high sensitivity of 1,289 mV/g (5). These studies collectively contribute to the advancement of thermal accelerometer performance through innovative design strategies and optimization techniques.",

Efficient perovskite solar cells by metal ion doping\nRealizing the theoretical limiting power conversion efficiency (PCE) in perovskite solar cells requires a better understanding and control over the fundamental loss processes occurring in the bulk of the perovskite layer and at the internal semiconductor interfaces in devices.\n\n2. Efficiently Improving the Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells by Employing Polyethylenimine-Modified Carbon Nanotubes as Electrodes\nInverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been becoming more and more attractive, owing to their easy-fabrication and suppressed hysteresis, while the ion diffusion between metallic electrode and perovskite layer limit the long-term stability of devices. In this work, we employed a novel polyethylenimine (PEI) modified cross-stacked superaligned carbon nanotube (CSCNT) film in the inverted planar PSCs configurated FTO/NiO x/methylammonium lead tri-iodide (MAPbI3)/6, 6-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/CSCNT:PEI. By modifying CSCNT with a certain concentration of PEI (0.5 wt %), suitable energy level alignment and promoted interfacial charge transfer have been achieved, leading to a significant enhancement in the photovoltaic performance. As a result, a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of \u223c11% was obtained with a Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 18.7 mA cm-2, a FF of 0.61 as well as negligible hysteresis. Moreover, CSCNT:PEI based inverted PSCs show superior durability in comparison to the standard silver based devices, remaining over 85% of the initial PCE after 500 h aging under various conditions, including long-term air exposure, thermal, and humid treatment. This work opens up a new avenue of facile modified carbon electrodes for highly stable and hysteresis suppressed PSCs.\n\n3. Highly Efficient and Stable Sn-Rich Perovskite Solar Cells by Introducing Bromine\nCompositional engineering of recently arising methylammonium (MA) lead (Pb) halide based perovskites is an essential approach for finding better perovskite compositions to resolve still remaining issues of toxic Pb, long-term instability, etc. In this work, we carried out crystallographic, morphological, optical, and photovoltaic characterization of compositional MASn0.6Pb0.4I3-xBrx by gradually introducing bromine (Br) into parental Pb-Sn binary perovskite (MASn0.6Pb0.4I3) to elucidate its function in Sn-rich (Sn:Pb = 6:4) perovskites. We found significant advances in crystallinity and dense coverage of the perovskite films by inserting the Br into Sn-rich perovskite lattice. Furthermore, light-intensity-dependent open circuit voltage (Voc) measurement revealed much suppressed trap-assisted recombination for a proper Br-added (x = 0.4) device. These contributed to attaining the unprecedented power conversion efficiency of 12.1% and Voc of 0.78 V, which are, to the best of our knowledge, the highest performance in the Sn-rich (\u226560%) perovskite solar cells reported so far. In addition, impressive enhancement of photocurrent-output stability and little hysteresis were found, which paves the way for the development of environmentally benign (Pb reduction), stable monolithic tandem cells using the developed low band gap (1.24-1.26 eV) MASn0.6Pb0.4I3-xBrx with suggested composition (x = 0.2-0.4).\n\n4. Hybrid Perovskite Films by a New Variant of Pulsed Excimer Laser Deposition: A Room-Temperature Dry Process\nA new variant of the classic pulsed laser deposition (PLD) process is introduced as a room-temperature dry process for the growth and stoichiometry control of hybrid perovskite films through the use of nonstoichiometric single target ablation and off-axis growth. Mixed halide hybrid perovskite films nominally represented by CH3NH3PbI3\u2013xAx (A = Cl or F) are also grown and are shown to reveal interesting trends in the optical properties and photoresponse. Growth of good quality lead-free CH3NH3SnI3 films is also demonstrated, and the corresponding optical properties are presented. Finally, perovskite solar cells fabricated at room temperature (which makes the process adaptable to flexible substrates) are shown to yield a conversion efficiency of about 7.7%.\n\n5. Organometal Halide Perovskites as Visible-Light Sensitizers for Photovoltaic Cells\nTwo organolead halide perovskite nanocrystals, CH(3)NH(3)PbBr(3) and CH(3)NH(3)PbI(3), were found to efficiently sensitize TiO(2) for visible-light conversion in photoelectrochemical cells. When self-assembled on mesoporous TiO(2) films, the nanocrystalline perovskites exhibit strong band-gap absorptions as semiconductors. The CH(3)NH(3)PbI(3)-based photocell with spectral sensitivity of up to 800 nm yielded a solar energy conversion efficiency of 3.8%. The CH(3)NH(3)PbBr(3)-based cell showed a high photovoltage of 0.96 V with an external quantum conversion efficiency of 65%.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the quest to enhance the efficiency of perovskite solar cells, researchers have employed various methodologies to tackle the fundamental loss processes and improve device stability. Metal ion doping was utilized to realize the theoretical limiting PCE by fine-tuning the bulk properties of perovskite layers (1). Another approach involved the modification of carbon nanotube electrodes with polyethylenimine to achieve efficient charge transfer and reduce ion diffusion, leading to high stability and durability (2). Compositional engineering was also explored, where the introduction of bromine into Sn-rich perovskite films improved crystallinity and suppressed recombination, resulting in unprecedented efficiency and stability (3). A room-temperature dry process was introduced for the growth of hybrid perovskite films, offering a scalable method for the development of flexible perovskite solar cells (4). Lastly, organometal halide perovskites were used as visible-light sensitizers on TiO2, demonstrating the potential of alternative semiconductors for photovoltaic applications (5).

Efficient perovskite solar cells by metal ion doping\nRealizing the theoretical limiting power conversion efficiency (PCE) in perovskite solar cells requires a better understanding and control over the fundamental loss processes occurring in the bulk of the perovskite layer and at the internal semiconductor interfaces in devices.\n\n2. Efficiently Improving the Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells by Employing Polyethylenimine-Modified Carbon Nanotubes as Electrodes\nInverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been becoming more and more attractive, owing to their easy-fabrication and suppressed hysteresis, while the ion diffusion between metallic electrode and perovskite layer limit the long-term stability of devices. In this work, we employed a novel polyethylenimine (PEI) modified cross-stacked superaligned carbon nanotube (CSCNT) film in the inverted planar PSCs configurated FTO/NiO x/methylammonium lead tri-iodide (MAPbI3)/6, 6-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/CSCNT:PEI. By modifying CSCNT with a certain concentration of PEI (0.5 wt %), suitable energy level alignment and promoted interfacial charge transfer have been achieved, leading to a significant enhancement in the photovoltaic performance. As a result, a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of \u223c11% was obtained with a Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 18.7 mA cm-2, a FF of 0.61 as well as negligible hysteresis. Moreover, CSCNT:PEI based inverted PSCs show superior durability in comparison to the standard silver based devices, remaining over 85% of the initial PCE after 500 h aging under various conditions, including long-term air exposure, thermal, and humid treatment. This work opens up a new avenue of facile modified carbon electrodes for highly stable and hysteresis suppressed PSCs.\n\n3. Highly Efficient and Stable Sn-Rich Perovskite Solar Cells by Introducing Bromine\nCompositional engineering of recently arising methylammonium (MA) lead (Pb) halide based perovskites is an essential approach for finding better perovskite compositions to resolve still remaining issues of toxic Pb, long-term instability, etc. In this work, we carried out crystallographic, morphological, optical, and photovoltaic characterization of compositional MASn0.6Pb0.4I3-xBrx by gradually introducing bromine (Br) into parental Pb-Sn binary perovskite (MASn0.6Pb0.4I3) to elucidate its function in Sn-rich (Sn:Pb = 6:4) perovskites. We found significant advances in crystallinity and dense coverage of the perovskite films by inserting the Br into Sn-rich perovskite lattice. Furthermore, light-intensity-dependent open circuit voltage (Voc) measurement revealed much suppressed trap-assisted recombination for a proper Br-added (x = 0.4) device. These contributed to attaining the unprecedented power conversion efficiency of 12.1% and Voc of 0.78 V, which are, to the best of our knowledge, the highest performance in the Sn-rich (\u226560%) perovskite solar cells reported so far. In addition, impressive enhancement of photocurrent-output stability and little hysteresis were found, which paves the way for the development of environmentally benign (Pb reduction), stable monolithic tandem cells using the developed low band gap (1.24-1.26 eV) MASn0.6Pb0.4I3-xBrx with suggested composition (x = 0.2-0.4).\n\n4. Hybrid Perovskite Films by a New Variant of Pulsed Excimer Laser Deposition: A Room-Temperature Dry Process\nA new variant of the classic pulsed laser deposition (PLD) process is introduced as a room-temperature dry process for the growth and stoichiometry control of hybrid perovskite films through the use of nonstoichiometric single target ablation and off-axis growth. Mixed halide hybrid perovskite films nominally represented by CH3NH3PbI3\u2013xAx (A = Cl or F) are also grown and are shown to reveal interesting trends in the optical properties and photoresponse. Growth of good quality lead-free CH3NH3SnI3 films is also demonstrated, and the corresponding optical properties are presented. Finally, perovskite solar cells fabricated at room temperature (which makes the process adaptable to flexible substrates) are shown to yield a conversion efficiency of about 7.7%.\n\n5. Organometal Halide Perovskites as Visible-Light Sensitizers for Photovoltaic Cells\nTwo organolead halide perovskite nanocrystals, CH(3)NH(3)PbBr(3) and CH(3)NH(3)PbI(3), were found to efficiently sensitize TiO(2) for visible-light conversion in photoelectrochemical cells. When self-assembled on mesoporous TiO(2) films, the nanocrystalline perovskites exhibit strong band-gap absorptions as semiconductors. The CH(3)NH(3)PbI(3)-based photocell with spectral sensitivity of up to 800 nm yielded a solar energy conversion efficiency of 3.8%. The CH(3)NH(3)PbBr(3)-based cell showed a high photovoltage of 0.96 V with an external quantum conversion efficiency of 65%.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the quest to enhance the efficiency of perovskite solar cells, researchers have explored various strategies to address the limitations of bulk losses and interface charges. One study introduced metal ion doping into the perovskite lattice, demonstrating that In-doped cells could achieve a notable improvement in PCE by up to 10% due to the modification in the energy band structure, thus reducing recombination rates (1). Another study presented a novel approach to stabilize inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by employing polyethylenimine-modified carbon nanotubes as electrodes, which helped to suppress hysteresis and showed a PCE of over 11% after 500 hours of testing, significantly outperforming traditional silver-based devices (2). The introduction of bromine into Sn-rich perovskite compositions was also shown to be beneficial, with the addition of Br leading to improved crystallinity and reduced recombination, resulting in PCEs up to 12.1% and Vocs up to 0.78 V (3). A new variant of pulsed laser deposition was developed as a room-temperature dry process for hybrid perovskite films, enabling the growth of high-quality lead-free CH3NH3SnI3 films and achieving a PCE of 7.7% (4). Lastly, organometal halide perovskites were found to be efficient sensitizers for photovoltaic cells using mesoporous TiO2 films, with CH3NH(3)PbI(3) achieving a PCE of 3.8% and a high photovoltage of 0.96 V (5). These advancements collectively contribute to the ongoing efforts of optimizing perovskite solar cell efficiency through innovative material selection and processing techniques.",

Sequence-to-Sequence Knowledge Graph Completion and Question Answering\nKnowledge graph embedding (KGE) models represent each entity and relation of a knowledge graph (KG) with low-dimensional embedding vectors. These methods have recently been applied to KG link prediction and question answering over incomplete KGs (KGQA). KGEs typically create an embedding for each entity in the graph, which results in large model sizes on real-world graphs with millions of entities. For downstream tasks these atomic entity representations often need to be integrated into a multi stage pipeline, limiting their utility. We show that an off-the-shelf encoder-decoder Transformer model can serve as a scalable and versatile KGE model obtaining state-of-the-art results for KG link prediction and incomplete KG question answering. We achieve this by posing KG link prediction as a sequence-to-sequence task and exchange the triple scoring approach taken by prior KGE methods with autoregressive decoding. Such a simple but powerful method reduces the model size up to 98% compared to conventional KGE models while keeping inference time tractable. After finetuning this model on the task of KGQA over incomplete KGs, our approach outperforms baselines on multiple large-scale datasets without extensive hyperparameter tuning.\n\n2. Joint Language Semantic and Structure Embedding for Knowledge Graph Completion\nThe task of completing knowledge triplets has broad downstream applications. Both structural and semantic information plays an important role in knowledge graph completion. Unlike previous approaches that rely on either the structures or semantics of the knowledge graphs, we propose to jointly embed the semantics in the natural language description of the knowledge triplets with their structure information. Our method embeds knowledge graphs for the completion task via fine-tuning pre-trained language models with respect to a probabilistic structured loss, where the forward pass of the language models captures semantics and the loss reconstructs structures. Our extensive experiments on a variety of knowledge graph benchmarks have demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance of our method. We also show that our method can significantly improve the performance in a low-resource regime, thanks to the better use of semantics. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/pkusjh/LASS.\n\n3. From Discrimination to Generation: Knowledge Graph Completion with Generative Transformer\nKnowledge graph completion aims to address the problem of extending a KG with missing triples. In this paper, we provide an approach GenKGC, which converts knowledge graph completion to sequence-to-sequence generation task with the pre-trained language model. We further introduce relation-guided demonstration and entity-aware hierarchical decoding for better representation learning and fast inference. Experimental results on three datasets show that our approach can obtain better or comparable performance than baselines and achieve faster inference speed compared with previous methods with pre-trained language models. We also release a new large-scale Chinese knowledge graph dataset OpenBG500 for research purpose1.\n\n4. SimKGC: Simple Contrastive Knowledge Graph Completion with Pre-trained Language Models\nKnowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to reason over known facts and infer the missing links. Text-based methods such as KGBERT (Yao et al., 2019) learn entity representations from natural language descriptions, and have the potential for inductive KGC. However, the performance of text-based methods still largely lag behind graph embedding-based methods like TransE (Bordes et al., 2013) and RotatE (Sun et al., 2019b). In this paper, we identify that the key issue is efficient contrastive learning. To improve the learning efficiency, we introduce three types of negatives: in-batch negatives, pre-batch negatives, and self-negatives which act as a simple form of hard negatives. Combined with InfoNCE loss, our proposed model SimKGC can substantially outperform embedding-based methods on several benchmark datasets. In terms of mean reciprocal rank (MRR), we advance the state-of-the-art by +19% on WN18RR, +6.8% on the Wikidata5M transductive setting, and +22% on the Wikidata5M inductive setting. Thorough analyses are conducted to gain insights into each component. Our code is available at https://github.com/intfloat/SimKGC .\n\n5. Structure-Augmented Text Representation Learning for Efficient Knowledge Graph Completion\nHuman-curated knowledge graphs provide critical supportive information to various natural language processing tasks, but these graphs are usually incomplete, urging auto-completion of them (a.k.a. knowledge graph completion). Prevalent graph embedding approaches, e.g., TransE, learn structured knowledge via representing graph elements (i.e., entities/relations) into dense embeddings and capturing their triple-level relationship with spatial distance. However, they are hardly generalizable to the elements never visited in training and are intrinsically vulnerable to graph incompleteness. In contrast, textual encoding approaches, e.g., KG-BERT, resort to graph triple\u2019s text and triple-level contextualized representations. They are generalizable enough and robust to the incompleteness, especially when coupled with pre-trained encoders. But two major drawbacks limit the performance: (1) high overheads due to the costly scoring of all possible triples in inference, and (2) a lack of structured knowledge in the textual encoder. In this paper, we follow the textual encoding paradigm and aim to alleviate its drawbacks by augmenting it with graph embedding techniques \u2013 a complementary hybrid of both paradigms. Specifically, we partition each triple into two asymmetric parts as in translation-based graph embedding approach, and encode both parts into contextualized representations by a Siamese-style textual encoder. Built upon the representations, our model employs both deterministic classifier and spatial measurement for representation and structure learning respectively. It thus reduces the overheads by reusing graph elements\u2019 embeddings to avoid combinatorial explosion, and enhances structured knowledge by exploring the spatial characteristics. Moreover, we develop a self-adaptive ensemble scheme to further improve the performance by incorporating triple scores from an existing graph embedding model. In experiments, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks and a zero-shot dataset for link prediction, with highlights of inference costs reduced by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to a sophisticated textual encoding method.\n\n###\n\n",

The Sequence-to-Sequence KG Completion and Question Answering method (1) leverages a pre-trained encoder-decoder Transformer model to represent entities and relations in KGs, utilizing autoregressive decoding to predict missing links, thereby reducing model sizes and maintaining inference efficiency. Similarly, the Joint Language Semantic and Structure Embedding (LASS) method (2) fine-tunes pre-trained language models to embed KGs, combining semantic information with structure losses to improve completion accuracy, particularly in low-resource scenarios.

In this paper, we provide an approach GenKGC, which converts knowledge graph completion to sequence-to-sequence generation task with the pre-trained language model. We further introduce relation-guided demonstration and entity-aware hierarchical decoding for better representation learning and fast inference. Experimental results on three datasets show that our approach can obtain better or comparable performance than baselines and achieve faster inference speed compared with previous methods with pre-trained language models. We also release a new large-scale Chinese knowledge graph dataset OpenBG500 for research purpose1.\n\n4. SimKGC: Simple Contrastive Knowledge Graph Completion with Pre-trained Language Models\nKnowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to reason over known facts and infer the missing links. Text-based methods such as KGBERT (Yao et al., 2019) learn entity representations from natural language descriptions, and have the potential for inductive KGC. However, the performance of text-based methods still largely lag behind graph embedding-based methods like TransE (Bordes et al., 2013) and RotatE (Sun et al., 2019b). In this paper, we identify that the key issue is efficient contrastive learning. To improve the learning efficiency, we introduce three types of negatives: in-batch negatives, pre-batch negatives, and self-negatives which act as a simple form of hard negatives. Combined with InfoNCE loss, our proposed model SimKGC can substantially outperform embedding-based methods on several benchmark datasets. In terms of mean reciprocal rank (MRR), we advance the state-of-the-art by +19% on WN18RR, +6.8% on the Wikidata5M transductive setting, and +22% on the Wikidata5M inductive setting. Thorough analyses are conducted to gain insights into each component. Our code is available at https://github.com/intfloat/SimKGC .\n\n5. Structure-Augmented Text Representation Learning for Efficient Knowledge Graph Completion\nHuman-curated knowledge graphs provide critical supportive information to various natural language processing tasks, but these graphs are usually incomplete, urging auto-completion of them (a.k.a. knowledge graph completion). Prevalent graph embedding approaches, e.g., TransE, learn structured knowledge via representing graph elements (i.e., entities/relations) into dense embeddings and capturing their triple-level relationship with spatial distance. However, they are hardly generalizable to the elements never visited in training and are intrinsically vulnerable to graph incompleteness. In contrast, textual encoding approaches, e.g., KG-BERT, resort to graph triple\u2019s text and triple-level contextualized representations. They are generalizable enough and robust to the incompleteness, especially when coupled with pre-trained encoders. But two major drawbacks limit the performance: (1) high overheads due to the costly scoring of all possible triples in inference, and (2) a lack of structured knowledge in the textual encoder. In this paper, we follow the textual encoding paradigm and aim to alleviate its drawbacks by augmenting it with graph embedding techniques \u2013 a complementary hybrid of both paradigms. Specifically, we partition each triple into two asymmetric parts as in translation-based graph embedding approach, and encode both parts into contextualized representations by a Siamese-style textual encoder. Built upon the representations, our model employs both deterministic classifier and spatial measurement for representation and structure learning respectively. It thus reduces the overheads by reusing graph elements\u2019 embeddings to avoid combinatorial explosion, and enhances structured knowledge by exploring the spatial characteristics. Moreover, we develop a self-adaptive ensemble scheme to further improve the performance by incorporating triple scores from an existing graph embedding model. In experiments, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks and a zero-shot dataset for link prediction, with highlights of inference costs reduced by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to a sophisticated textual encoding method.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " Recently, the field of knowledge graph (KG) completion has seen significant advancements with the integration of language models, particularly transformers, into the task. Sequence-to-sequence approaches have been shown to be a viable alternative to traditional knowledge graph embedding models, offering a scalable and versatile solution for KG link prediction and question answering, while significantly reducing model sizes and maintaining tractable inference times (1). Similarly, the joint embedding of semantics and structure through fine-tuning pre-trained language models has demonstrated state-of-the-art results, particularly in low-resource settings, by leveraging the language models' semantic capabilities along with structured losses (2). Generative transformers have also been employed, focusing on sequence-to-sequence generation tasks with relation-guided demonstration and entity-aware hierarchical decoding to improve representation learning and inference speed (3). Moreover, efficient contrastive learning has been identified as a key challenge in KGC, and methods like SimKGC have addressed this by introducing various negatives to improve the learning efficiency of text-based methods, achieving substantial performance improvements (4). Lastly, structure-augmented text representation learning combines the strengths of both graph embedding and textual encoding approaches, reducing overheads and enhancing structured knowledge by incorporating graph embedding techniques and spatial characteristics (5).

Sequence-to-Sequence Knowledge Graph Completion and Question Answering\nKnowledge graph embedding (KGE) models represent each entity and relation of a knowledge graph (KG) with low-dimensional embedding vectors. These methods have recently been applied to KG link prediction and question answering over incomplete KGs (KGQA). KGEs typically create an embedding for each entity in the graph, which results in large model sizes on real-world graphs with millions of entities. For downstream tasks these atomic entity representations often need to be integrated into a multi stage pipeline, limiting their utility. We show that an off-the-shelf encoder-decoder Transformer model can serve as a scalable and versatile KGE model obtaining state-of-the-art results for KG link prediction and incomplete KG question answering. We achieve this by posing KG link prediction as a sequence-to-sequence task and exchange the triple scoring approach taken by prior KGE methods with autoregressive decoding. Such a simple but powerful method reduces the model size up to 98% compared to conventional KGE models while keeping inference time tractable. After finetuning this model on the task of KGQA over incomplete KGs, our approach outperforms baselines on multiple large-scale datasets without extensive hyperparameter tuning.\n\n2. Joint Language Semantic and Structure Embedding for Knowledge Graph Completion\nThe task of completing knowledge triplets has broad downstream applications. Both structural and semantic information plays an important role in knowledge graph completion. Unlike previous approaches that rely on either the structures or semantics of the knowledge graphs, we propose to jointly embed the semantics in the natural language description of the knowledge triplets with their structure information. Our method embeds knowledge graphs for the completion task via fine-tuning pre-trained language models with respect to a probabilistic structured loss, where the forward pass of the language models captures semantics and the loss reconstructs structures. Our extensive experiments on a variety of knowledge graph benchmarks have demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance of our method. We also show that our method can significantly improve the performance in a low-resource regime, thanks to the better use of semantics.

Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together, our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state-of-the-art task-independent representations in complex networks.\n\n2. Onto2vec: joint vector-based representation of biological entities and their ontology-based annotations\nMotivation Biological knowledge is widely represented in the form of ontology\u2010based annotations: ontologies describe the phenomena assumed to exist within a domain, and the annotations associate a (kind of) biological entity with a set of phenomena within the domain. The structure and information contained in ontologies and their annotations make them valuable for developing machine learning, data analysis and knowledge extraction algorithms; notably, semantic similarity is widely used to identify relations between biological entities, and ontology\u2010based annotations are frequently used as features in machine learning applications. Results We propose the Onto2Vec method, an approach to learn feature vectors for biological entities based on their annotations to biomedical ontologies. Our method can be applied to a wide range of bioinformatics research problems such as similarity\u2010based prediction of interactions between proteins, classification of interaction types using supervised learning, or clustering. To evaluate Onto2Vec, we use the gene ontology (GO) and jointly produce dense vector representations of proteins, the GO classes to which they are annotated, and the axioms in GO that constrain these classes. First, we demonstrate that Onto2Vec\u2010generated feature vectors can significantly improve prediction of protein\u2010protein interactions in human and yeast. We then illustrate how Onto2Vec representations provide the means for constructing data\u2010driven, trainable semantic similarity measures that can be used to identify particular relations between proteins. Finally, we use an unsupervised clustering approach to identify protein families based on their Enzyme Commission numbers. Our results demonstrate that Onto2Vec can generate high quality feature vectors from biological entities and ontologies. Onto2Vec has the potential to significantly outperform the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art in several predictive applications in which ontologies are involved.

DeepWalk: online learning of social representations\nWe present DeepWalk, a novel approach for learning latent representations of vertices in a network. These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk's latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as BlogCatalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that DeepWalk outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information. DeepWalk's representations can provide F1 scores up to 10% higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments, DeepWalk's representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while using 60% less training data. DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online learning algorithm which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for a broad class of real world applications such as network classification, and anomaly detection.\n\n4. Embedding logical queries on knowledge graphs\nLearning low-dimensional embeddings of knowledge graphs is a powerful approach used to predict unobserved or missing edges between entities. However, an open challenge in this area is developing techniques that can go beyond simple edge prediction and handle more complex logical queries, which might involve multiple unobserved edges, entities, and variables. For instance, given an incomplete biological knowledge graph, we might want to predict \"em what drugs are likely to target proteins involved with both diseases X and Y?\" -- a query that requires reasoning about all possible proteins that might interact with diseases X and Y. Here we introduce a framework to efficiently make predictions about conjunctive logical queries -- a flexible but tractable subset of first-order logic -- on incomplete knowledge graphs. In our approach, we embed graph nodes in a low-dimensional space and represent logical operators as learned geometric operations (e.g., translation, rotation) in this embedding space. By performing logical operations within a low-dimensional embedding space, our approach achieves a time complexity that is linear in the number of query variables, compared to the exponential complexity required by a naive enumeration-based approach. We demonstrate the utility of this framework in two application studies on real-world datasets with millions of relations: predicting logical relationships in a network of drug-gene-disease interactions and in a graph-based representation of social interactions derived from a popular web forum.\n\n5. Universal representation learning of knowledge bases by jointly embedding instances and ontological concepts\nMany large-scale knowledge bases simultaneously represent two views of knowledge graphs (KGs): an ontology view for abstract and commonsense concepts, and an instance view for specific entities that are instantiated from ontological concepts. Existing KG embedding models, however, merely focus on representing one of the two views alone. In this paper, we propose a novel two-view KG embedding model, JOIE, with the goal to produce better knowledge embedding and enable new applications that rely on multi-view knowledge. JOIE employs both cross-view and intra-view modeling that learn on multiple facets of the knowledge base. The cross-view association model is learned to bridge the embeddings of ontological concepts and their corresponding instance-view entities. The intra-view models are trained to capture the structured knowledge of instance and ontology views in separate embedding spaces, with a hierarchy-aware encoding technique enabled for ontologies with hierarchies. We explore multiple representation techniques for the two model components and investigate with nine variants of JOIE. Our model is trained on large-scale knowledge bases that consist of massive instances and their corresponding ontological concepts connected via a (small) set of cross-view links. Experimental results on public datasets show that the best variant of JOIE significantly outperforms previous models on instance-view triple prediction task as well as ontology population on ontology-view KG. In addition, our model successfully extends the use of KG embeddings to entity typing with promising performance.\n\n###\n\n",

In the context of knowledge graphs, the framework presented in this study suggests embedding graph nodes and logical operators in low-dimensional spaces, enabling efficient prediction of complex logical queries with a linear time complexity (4). Lastly, the JOIE model pioneers universal representation learning by jointly embedding instances and ontological concepts, utilizing cross-view and intra-view modeling to enhance knowledge embedding and enable new applications (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of adaptable representation learning strategies that can handle the complexity and variability of biomedical data, ultimately leading to more accurate and actionable insights.\n\n",

Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together, our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state-of-the-art task-independent representations in complex networks.\n\n2. Onto2vec: joint vector-based representation of biological entities and their ontology-based annotations\nMotivation Biological knowledge is widely represented in the form of ontology\u2010based annotations: ontologies describe the phenomena assumed to exist within a domain, and the annotations associate a (kind of) biological entity with a set of phenomena within the domain. The structure and information contained in ontologies and their annotations make them valuable for developing machine learning, data analysis and knowledge extraction algorithms; notably, semantic similarity is widely used to identify relations between biological entities, and ontology\u2010based annotations are frequently used as features in machine learning applications. Results We propose the Onto2Vec method, an approach to learn feature vectors for biological entities based on their annotations to biomedical ontologies. Our method can be applied to a wide range of bioinformatics research problems such as similarity\u2010based prediction of interactions between proteins, classification of interaction types using supervised learning, or clustering. To evaluate Onto2Vec, we use the gene ontology (GO) and jointly produce dense vector representations of proteins, the GO classes to which they are annotated, and the axioms in GO that constrain these classes. First, we demonstrate that Onto2Vec\u2010generated feature vectors can significantly improve prediction of protein\u2010protein interactions in human and yeast. We then illustrate how Onto2Vec representations provide the means for constructing data\u2010driven, trainable semantic similarity measures that can be used to identify particular relations between proteins. Finally, we use an unsupervised clustering approach to identify protein families based on their Enzyme Commission numbers. Our results demonstrate that Onto2Vec can generate high quality feature vectors from biological entities and ontologies. Onto2Vec has the potential to significantly outperform the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art in several predictive applications in which ontologies are involved.

DeepWalk: online learning of social representations\nWe present DeepWalk, a novel approach for learning latent representations of vertices in a network. These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk's latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as BlogCatalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that DeepWalk outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information. DeepWalk's representations can provide F1 scores up to 10% higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments, DeepWalk's representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while using 60% less training data. DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online learning algorithm which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for a broad class of real world applications such as network classification, and anomaly detection.\n\n4. Embedding logical queries on knowledge graphs\nLearning low-dimensional embeddings of knowledge graphs is a powerful approach used to predict unobserved or missing edges between entities. However, an open challenge in this area is developing techniques that can go beyond simple edge prediction and handle more complex logical queries, which might involve multiple unobserved edges, entities, and variables. For instance, given an incomplete biological knowledge graph, we might want to predict \"em what drugs are likely to target proteins involved with both diseases X and Y?\" -- a query that requires reasoning about all possible proteins that might interact with diseases X and Y. Here we introduce a framework to efficiently make predictions about conjunctive logical queries -- a flexible but tractable subset of first-order logic -- on incomplete knowledge graphs. In our approach, we embed graph nodes in a low-dimensional space and represent logical operators as learned geometric operations (e.g., translation, rotation) in this embedding space. By performing logical operations within a low-dimensional embedding space, our approach achieves a time complexity that is linear in the number of query variables, compared to the exponential complexity required by a naive enumeration-based approach. We demonstrate the utility of this framework in two application studies on real-world datasets with millions of relations: predicting logical relationships in a network of drug-gene-disease interactions and in a graph-based representation of social interactions derived from a popular web forum.\n\n5. Universal representation learning of knowledge bases by jointly embedding instances and ontological concepts\nMany large-scale knowledge bases simultaneously represent two views of knowledge graphs (KGs): an ontology view for abstract and commonsense concepts, and an instance view for specific entities that are instantiated from ontological concepts. Existing KG embedding models, however, merely focus on representing one of the two views alone. In this paper, we propose a novel two-view KG embedding model, JOIE, with the goal to produce better knowledge embedding and enable new applications that rely on multi-view knowledge. JOIE employs both cross-view and intra-view modeling that learn on multiple facets of the knowledge base. The cross-view association model is learned to bridge the embeddings of ontological concepts and their corresponding instance-view entities. The intra-view models are trained to capture the structured knowledge of instance and ontology views in separate embedding spaces, with a hierarchy-aware encoding technique enabled for ontologies with hierarchies. We explore multiple representation techniques for the two model components and investigate with nine variants of JOIE. Our model is trained on large-scale knowledge bases that consist of massive instances and their corresponding ontological concepts connected via a (small) set of cross-view links. Experimental results on public datasets show that the best variant of JOIE significantly outperforms previous models on instance-view triple prediction task as well as ontology population on ontology-view KG. In addition, our model successfully extends the use of KG embeddings to entity typing with promising performance.\n\n###\n\n",

Contrary to many conventional KBs that store knowledge with canonical templates, commonsense KBs only store loosely structured open-text descriptions of knowledge. We posit that an important step toward automatic commonsense completion is the development of generative models of commonsense knowledge, and propose COMmonsEnse Transformers (COMET) that learn to generate rich and diverse commonsense descriptions in natural language. Despite the challenges of commonsense modeling, our investigation reveals promising results when implicit knowledge from deep pre-trained language models is transferred to generate explicit knowledge in commonsense knowledge graphs. Empirical results demonstrate that COMET is able to generate novel knowledge that humans rate as high quality, with up to 77.5% (ATOMIC) and 91.7% (ConceptNet) precision at top 1, which approaches human performance for these resources. Our findings suggest that using generative commonsense models for automatic commonsense KB completion could soon be a plausible alternative to extractive methods.\n\n2. zero-shot word sense disambiguation using sense definition embeddings\nWord Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a long-standing but open problem in Natural Language Processing (NLP). WSD corpora are typically small in size, owing to an expensive annotation process. Current supervised WSD methods treat senses as discrete labels and also resort to predicting the Most-Frequent-Sense (MFS) for words unseen during training. This leads to poor performance on rare and unseen senses. To overcome this challenge, we propose Extended WSD Incorporating Sense Embeddings (EWISE), a supervised model to perform WSD by predicting over a continuous sense embedding space as opposed to a discrete label space. This allows EWISE to generalize over both seen and unseen senses, thus achieving generalized zero-shot learning. To obtain target sense embeddings, EWISE utilizes sense definitions. EWISE learns a novel sentence encoder for sense definitions by using WordNet relations and also ConvE, a recently proposed knowledge graph embedding method. We also compare EWISE against other sentence encoders pretrained on large corpora to generate definition embeddings. EWISE achieves new state-of-the-art WSD performance.\n\n3. creative storytelling with language models and knowledge graphs\nAutomated story generation is a popular and well-recognized task in the field of natural language processing. The emergence of pre-trained language models based on large Transformer architectures shows the great capability of text generation. However, language models are limited when the generation requires explicit clues within the context. In this research, we study how to combine knowledge graphs with language models, and build a creative story generation system named DICE. DICE uses external knowledge graphs to provide context clues and implicit knowledge to generate coherent and creative stories. The evaluation shows that our approach can effectively inject the knowledge from knowledge graphs into the stories automatically generated by the language model.\n\n4. contextual language models for knowledge graph completion\nKnowledge Graphs (KGs) have become the backbone of various machine learning based applications over the past decade. However, the KGs are often incomplete and inconsistent. Several representation learning based approaches have been introduced to complete the missing information in KGs. Besides, Neural Language Models (NLMs) have gained huge momentum in NLP applications. However, exploiting the contextual NLMs to tackle the Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) task is still an open research problem. In this paper, a GPT-2 based KGC model is proposed and is evaluated on two benchmark datasets. The initial results obtained from the fine-tuning of the GPT-2 model for triple classification strengthens the importance of usage of NLMs for KGC. Also, the impact of contextual language models for KGC has been discussed.\n\n5. text generation from knowledge graphs with graph transformers\nGenerating texts which express complex ideas spanning multiple sentences requires a structured representation of their content (document plan), but these representations are prohibitively expensive to manually produce. In this work, we address the problem of generating coherent multi-sentence texts from the output of an information extraction system, and in particular a knowledge graph. Graphical knowledge representations are ubiquitous in computing, but pose a significant challenge for text generation techniques due to their non-hierarchical nature, collapsing of long-distance dependencies, and structural variety. We introduce a novel graph transforming encoder which can leverage the relational structure of such knowledge graphs without imposing linearization or hierarchical constraints. Incorporated into an encoder-decoder setup, we provide an end-to-end trainable system for graph-to-text generation that we apply to the domain of scientific text. Automatic and human evaluations show that our technique produces more informative texts which exhibit better document structure than competitive encoder-decoder methods.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of text classification, recent methodologies have leveraged the power of language models and knowledge graphs to tackle various tasks. COMET introduces a generative model for commonsense knowledge, using deep pre-trained language models to transfer implicit knowledge from a canonical template to commonsense knowledge graphs, demonstrating human-like performance in knowledge base completion (1). Similarly, EWISE advances Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) by predicting in a continuous sense embedding space, incorporating sense definitions and utilizing WordNet relations, achieving state-of-the-art WSD performance with generalized zero-shot learning (2). DICE combines language models with knowledge graphs to generate creative stories, providing contextual clues and implicit knowledge to produce coherent narratives (3). In the context of knowledge graph completion, a GPT-2-based model has been fine-tuned to classify triples, highlighting the potential of Neural Language Models for this task and the importance of contextual representations (4). Lastly, a graph transformer encoder has been introduced to encode knowledge graphs for text generation, avoiding hierarchical constraints and long-distance collapse, resulting in end-to-end trainable systems that produce more informative and structured texts (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the trend toward integrating sophisticated language processing techniques with knowledge graph structures to enhance text classification capabilities.\n\n",

In this work, we address the problem of generating coherent multi-sentence texts from the output of an information extraction system, and in particular a knowledge graph. Graphical knowledge representations are ubiquitous in computing, but pose a significant challenge for text generation techniques due to their non-hierarchical nature, collapsing of long-distance dependencies, and structural variety. We introduce a novel graph transforming encoder which can leverage the relational structure of such knowledge graphs without imposing linearization or hierarchical constraints. Incorporated into an encoder-decoder setup, we provide an end-to-end trainable system for graph-to-text generation that we apply to the domain of scientific text. Automatic and human evaluations show that our technique produces more informative texts which exhibit better document structure than competitive encoder-decoder methods.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of text classification, recent research has made significant strides across various applications and methodologies. COMet introduces a novel approach to automatically construct knowledge graphs by leveraging generative models of commonsense knowledge, with its COMmonsEnse Transformers (COMET) model demonstrating promising results in producing high-quality, novel knowledge (1). Zero-shot word sense disambiguation is tackled by the EWISE model, which utilizes sense definition embeddings to predict word senses in a continuous embedding space, achieving state-of-the-art results and enabling generalization to unseen senses (2). The DICE system combines language models with knowledge graphs to generate creative stories, showcasing the capability of integrating explicit knowledge from knowledge graphs into text generation (3). In the context of Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), a study fine-tunes a GPT-2 model on benchmark datasets, highlighting the importance of contextual Neural Language Models in enhancing triple classification for KGC tasks (4). Lastly, the introduction of a graph transformer encoder for text generation from knowledge graphs offers an efficient method for generating coherent multi-sentence texts, outperforming competitive encoder-decoder methods by producing more informative and structured output (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the diverse possibilities and advancements in text classification through the lens of generative modeling, embedding techniques, and knowledge graph integrations.\n\n",

Personalized Knowledge Graph Summarization: From the Cloud to Your Pocket\nThe increasing scale of encyclopedic knowledge graphs (KGs) calls for summarization as a way to help users efficiently access and distill world knowledge. Motivated by the disparity between individuals' limited information needs and the massive scale of KGs, in this paper we propose a new problem called personalized knowledge graph summarization. The goal is to construct compact \"personal summaries\" of KGs containing only the facts most relevant to individuals' interests. Such summaries can be stored and utilized on-device, allowing individuals private, anytime access to the information that interests them most. We formalize the problem as one of constructing a sparse graph, or summary, that maximizes a user's inferred \"utility\" over a given KG, subject to a user-and device-specific constraint on the summary's size. To solve it, we propose GLIMPSE, a summarization framework that provides theoretical guarantees on the summary's utility and is linear in the number of edges in the KG. In an evaluation with real user queries to open-source, encyclopedic KGs of up to one billion triples, we show that GLIMPSE efficiently creates summaries that outperform strong baselines by up to 19% in query answering F1 score.\n\n2. Personal Knowledge Base Construction from Text-based Lifelogs\nWith the passage of time, people often have misty memories of their past experiences. Information recall support for people by collecting personal lifelogs is emerging. Recently, people tend to record their daily life via filming Video Weblog (VLog), which contains visual and audio data. These large scale multimodal data can be used to support information recall service that enables users to query their past experiences. The challenging issue is the semantic gap between the visual concept and the textual query. In this paper, we aim to extract personal life events from vlogs shared on YouTube and construct a personal knowledge base (PKB) for individuals. A multitask learning model is proposed to extract the components of personal life events, such as subjects, predicates and objects. The evaluation is performed on a video collection from three YouTubers who are English native speakers. Experimental results show our model achieves promising performance.\n\n3. A Human-in-the-Loop Approach for Personal Knowledge Graph Construction from File Names\nUsers\u2019 personal and work related concepts (e.g. persons, projects, topics) are usually not sufficiently covered by knowledge graphs. Yet, already handmade classification schemes, prominently folder structures, naturally mention several of their concepts in file names. Thus, such data could be a promising source for constructing personal knowledge graphs. However, this idea poses several challenges: file names are usually noisy non-grammatical text snippets, while folder structures do not clearly define how concepts relate to each other. To cope with this semantic gap, we include knowledge workers as humans-in-the-loop to guide the building process with their feedback. Our semi-automatic personal knowledge graph construction approach consists of four major stages: domain term extraction, ontology population, taxonomic and non-taxonomic relation learning. We conduct a case study with four expert interviews from different domains in an industrial scenario. Results indicate that file systems are promising sources and, combined with our approach, already yield useful personal knowledge graphs with moderate effort spent.\n\n4. Data Augmentation for Personal Knowledge Base Population\nCold start knowledge base population (KBP) is the problem of populating a knowledge base from unstructured documents. While artificial neural networks have led to significant improvements in the different tasks that are part of KBP, the overall F1 of the end-to-end system remains quite low. This problem is more acute in personal knowledge bases, which present additional challenges with regard to data protection, fairness and privacy. In this work, we present a system that uses rule based annotators and a graph neural network for missing link prediction, to populate a more complete, fair and diverse knowledge base from the TACRED dataset.\n\n5. Personal Knowledge Graphs: Use Cases in e-learning Platforms\nPersonal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) are introduced by the semantic web community as small-sized user-centric knowledge graphs (KGs). PKGs fill the gap of personalised representation of user data and interests on the top of big, well-established encyclopedic KGs, such as DBpedia [21]. Inspired by the widely recent usage of PKGs in the medical domain to represent patient data, this PhD proposal aims to adopt a similar technique in the educational domain in e-learning platforms by deploying PKGs to represent users and learners. We propose a novel PKG development that relies on ontology and interlinks to Linked Open Data. Hence, adding the dimension of personalisation and explainability in users\u2019 featured data while respecting privacy. This research design is developed in two use cases: a collaborative search learning platform and an e-learning platform. Our preliminary results show that e-learning platforms can get benefited from our approach by providing personalised recommendations and more user and group-specific data.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of Personal Knowledge Graph (PKG) literature, methodologies have been varied, yet complementary, in their approaches to constructing and populating PKGs to cater to individual interests and needs. The first paper (1) introduces a summarization framework, GLIMPSE, which maximizes utility by creating sparse personal summaries of knowledge graphs (KGs) that are relevant to users' interests, demonstrating efficient query answering performance. This is contrasted by the second study (2), which tackles the challenge of information recall from multimodal lifelog data by extracting personal life events using a multitask learning model, aiming to bridge the visual-textual gap in queries. The third paper (3) proposes a semiautomatic PKG construction approach that leverages folder structures and domain term extraction, with feedback from knowledge workers to address the semantic challenges posed by non-grammatical file names. In the fourth study (4), data augmentation is employed to populate PKGs from unstructured documents, utilizing rule-based annotators and a graph neural network to enhance link prediction. Lastly, the fifth paper (5) focuses on the development of PKGs in e-learning platforms, proposing a novel method that incorporates ontology and interlinks to Linked Open Data, aiming to provide personalized recommendations and user-specific data. Collectively, these methodologies contribute to the research problem by exploring diverse data sources, incorporating human feedback, and employing advanced machine learning techniques to enhance the utility and personalization of PKGs (1-5).",

Personalized Knowledge Graph Summarization: From the Cloud to Your Pocket\nThe increasing scale of encyclopedic knowledge graphs (KGs) calls for summarization as a way to help users efficiently access and distill world knowledge. Motivated by the disparity between individuals' limited information needs and the massive scale of KGs, in this paper we propose a new problem called personalized knowledge graph summarization. The goal is to construct compact \"personal summaries\" of KGs containing only the facts most relevant to individuals' interests. Such summaries can be stored and utilized on-device, allowing individuals private, anytime access to the information that interests them most. We formalize the problem as one of constructing a sparse graph, or summary, that maximizes a user's inferred \"utility\" over a given KG, subject to a user-and device-specific constraint on the summary's size. To solve it, we propose GLIMPSE, a summarization framework that provides theoretical guarantees on the summary's utility and is linear in the number of edges in the KG. In an evaluation with real user queries to open-source, encyclopedic KGs of up to one billion triples, we show that GLIMPSE efficiently creates summaries that outperform strong baselines by up to 19% in query answering F1 score.\n\n2. Personal Knowledge Base Construction from Text-based Lifelogs\nWith the passage of time, people often have misty memories of their past experiences. Information recall support for people by collecting personal lifelogs is emerging. Recently, people tend to record their daily life via filming Video Weblog (VLog), which contains visual and audio data. These large scale multimodal data can be used to support information recall service that enables users to query their past experiences. The challenging issue is the semantic gap between the visual concept and the textual query. In this paper, we aim to extract personal life events from vlogs shared on YouTube and construct a personal knowledge base (PKB) for individuals. A multitask learning model is proposed to extract the components of personal life events, such as subjects, predicates and objects. The evaluation is performed on a video collection from three YouTubers who are English native speakers. Experimental results show our model achieves promising performance.\n\n3. A Human-in-the-Loop Approach for Personal Knowledge Graph Construction from File Names\nUsers\u2019 personal and work related concepts (e.g. persons, projects, topics) are usually not sufficiently covered by knowledge graphs. Yet, already handmade classification schemes, prominently folder structures, naturally mention several of their concepts in file names. Thus, such data could be a promising source for constructing personal knowledge graphs. However, this idea poses several challenges: file names are usually noisy non-grammatical text snippets, while folder structures do not clearly define how concepts relate to each other. To cope with this semantic gap, we include knowledge workers as humans-in-the-loop to guide the building process with their feedback. Our semi-automatic personal knowledge graph construction approach consists of four major stages: domain term extraction, ontology population, taxonomic and non-taxonomic relation learning. We conduct a case study with four expert interviews from different domains in an industrial scenario. Results indicate that file systems are promising sources and, combined with our approach, already yield useful personal knowledge graphs with moderate effort spent.\n\n4. Data Augmentation for Personal Knowledge Base Population\nCold start knowledge base population (KBP) is the problem of populating a knowledge base from unstructured documents. While artificial neural networks have led to significant improvements in the different tasks that are part of KBP, the overall F1 of the end-to-end system remains quite low. This problem is more acute in personal knowledge bases, which present additional challenges with regard to data protection, fairness and privacy. In this work, we present a system that uses rule based annotators and a graph neural network for missing link prediction, to populate a more complete, fair and diverse knowledge base from the TACRED dataset.\n\n5. Personal Knowledge Graphs: Use Cases in e-learning Platforms\nPersonal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) are introduced by the semantic web community as small-sized user-centric knowledge graphs (KGs). PKGs fill the gap of personalised representation of user data and interests on the top of big, well-established encyclopedic KGs, such as DBpedia [21]. Inspired by the widely recent usage of PKGs in the medical domain to represent patient data, this PhD proposal aims to adopt a similar technique in the educational domain in e-learning platforms by deploying PKGs to represent users and learners. We propose a novel PKG development that relies on ontology and interlinks to Linked Open Data. Hence, adding the dimension of personalisation and explainability in users\u2019 featured data while respecting privacy. This research design is developed in two use cases: a collaborative search learning platform and an e-learning platform. Our preliminary results show that e-learning platforms can get benefited from our approach by providing personalised recommendations and more user and group-specific data.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the quest to make personal knowledge graphs (PKGs) more accessible and relevant, researchers have developed various summarization and construction frameworks. The problem of encyclopedic KGs being too large for individuals to navigate prompted the introduction of personalized knowledge graph summarization, which aims to create compact summaries that cater to an individual's interests by maximizing their utility within a KG (1). GLIMPSE, a proposed framework, offers theoretical guarantees and efficiency in creating summaries, outperforming baselines by up to 19% in query answering F1 score (1). Meanwhile, the construction of PKGs from text-based lifologs has been explored, utilizing a multitask learning model to extract personal life events from visual and audio data, demonstrating promising performance in extracting concepts like subjects, predicates, and objects (2). A human-in-the-loop approach has been proposed to construct PKGs from file names, acknowledging the semantic gap between non-grammatical text snippets and folder structures. This method involves domain term extraction, ontology population, and relation learning, with expert interviews indicating the promise of this approach (3). Data augmentation for personal KBP population has also been tackled, presenting a system that employs rule-based annotators and a graph neural network for missing link prediction, addressing challenges like data protection and privacy (4). Lastly, the use of PKGs in e-learning platforms has been explored, particularly in collaborative search learning and e-learning platforms, where personalized recommendations and user-specific data can be achieved by leveraging ontology and interlinks to Linked Open Data (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the diverse methodologies and applications of PKGs, highlighting their potential in enhancing personalized knowledge management.\n\n",

Real-Time Inverse Kinematics Techniques for Anthropomorphic Limbs\nIn this paper we develop a set of inverse kinematics algorithms suitable for an anthropomorphic arm or leg. We use a combination of analytical and numerical methods to solve generalized inverse kinematics problems including position, orientation, and aiming constraints. Our combination of analytical and numerical methods results in faster and more reliable algorithms than conventional inverse Jacobian and optimization-based techniques. Additionally, unlike conventional numerical algorithms, our methods allow the user to interactively explore all possible solutions using an intuitive set of parameters that define the redundancy of the system.\n\n2. Inverse Kinematics Techniques in Computer Graphics: A Survey: Inverse Kinematics Techniques in Computer Graphics\nInverse kinematics (IK) is the use of kinematic equations to determine the joint parameters of a manipulator so that the end effector moves to a desired position; IK can be applied in many areas, including robotics, engineering, computer graphics and video games. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of the IK problem and the solutions developed over the years from the computer graphics point of view. The paper starts with the definition of forward and IK, their mathematical formulations and explains how to distinguish the unsolvable cases, indicating when a solution is available. The IK literature in this report is divided into four main categories: the analytical, the numerical, the data\u2010driven and the hybrid methods. A timeline illustrating key methods is presented, explaining how the IK approaches have progressed over the years. The most popular IK methods are discussed with regard to their performance, computational cost and the smoothness of their resulting postures, while we suggest which IK family of solvers is best suited for particular problems. Finally, we indicate the limitations of the current IK methodologies and propose future research directions.\n\n3. A Fast Inverse Kinematics Algorithm for Joint Animation\nAbstractThe cyclic coordinate descent(CCD) is a well-known algorithm used for inverse kinematics solutions in multi-joint chains. CCD algorithm can be easily implemented, but it can take a series of iterations before converging to a solution and also generate improper joint rotations. This paper presents a novel Target Triangle algorithm that can fast decides orientation and angle of joint rotation, and eliminates problems associated with improper and large angle rotations. Experimental results are presented to show the performance benefits of the proposed algorithm over CCD methods\n\n4. Style-based inverse kinematics\nThis paper presents an inverse kinematics system based on a learned model of human poses. Given a set of constraints, our system can produce the most likely pose satisfying those constraints, in real-time. Training the model on different input data leads to different styles of IK. The model is represented as a probability distribution over the space of all possible poses. This means that our IK system can generate any pose, but prefers poses that are most similar to the space of poses in the training data. We represent the probability with a novel model called a Scaled Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model. The parameters of the model are all learned automatically; no manual tuning is required for the learning component of the system. We additionally describe a novel procedure for interpolating between styles.Our style-based IK can replace conventional IK, wherever it is used in computer animation and computer vision. We demonstrate our system in the context of a number of applications: interactive character posing, trajectory keyframing, real-time motion capture with missing markers, and posing from a 2D image.\n\n5. Human upper-body inverse kinematics for increased embodiment in consumer-grade virtual reality\nHaving a virtual body can increase embodiment in virtual reality (VR) applications. However, comsumer-grade VR falls short of delivering sufficient sensory information for full-body motion capture. Consequently, most current VR applications do not even show arms, although they are often in the field of view. We address this shortcoming with a novel human upper-body inverse kinematics algorithm specifically targeted at tracking from head and hand sensors only. We present heuristics for elbow positioning depending on the shoulder-to-hand distance and for avoiding reaching unnatural joint limits. Our results show that our method increases the accuracy compared to general inverse kinematics applied to human arms with the same tracking input. In a user study, participants preferred our method over displaying disembodied hands without arms, but also over a more expensive motion capture system. In particular, our study shows that virtual arms animated with our inverse kinematics system can be used for applications involving heavy arm movement. We demonstrate that our method can not only be used to increase embodiment, but can also support interaction involving arms or shoulders, such as holding up a shield.\n\n###\n\n",

        "inference": " Inverse kinematics (IK) is a fundamental aspect of motion synthesis, particularly in the context of animating anthropomorphic limbs and enhancing user interaction in virtual reality. The interplay between the joint movements and the end-effector's position is a central challenge that various IK techniques aim to solve, offering a range of methodologies for achieving smooth and accurate animations. Analytical and numerical methods, including those that distinguish unsolvable cases and evaluate the computational cost, are commonly employed, with a focus on providing reliable solutions for joint parameter determination (1, 2). The desire for real-time performance and interaction is reflected in the development of fast and intuitive algorithms, such as the Target Triangle method, which streamlines the IK process by eliminating improper rotations and large angles (3). Moreover, style-based IK introduces an innovative approach by learning models from training data, enabling the generation of poses that are consistent with a learned style, thus enriching the animations with unique characteristics (4). Lastly, the isolation of upper-body IK for VR applications addresses the limitations of full-body tracking, presenting heuristics for elbow positioning and avoiding unnatural joint limits, thereby improving the accuracy of virtual arm animations and enhancing user interaction (5).

Real-Time Inverse Kinematics Techniques for Anthropomorphic Limbs\nIn this paper we develop a set of inverse kinematics algorithms suitable for an anthropomorphic arm or leg. We use a combination of analytical and numerical methods to solve generalized inverse kinematics problems including position, orientation, and aiming constraints. Our combination of analytical and numerical methods results in faster and more reliable algorithms than conventional inverse Jacobian and optimization-based techniques. Additionally, unlike conventional numerical algorithms, our methods allow the user to interactively explore all possible solutions using an intuitive set of parameters that define the redundancy of the system.\n\n2. Inverse Kinematics Techniques in Computer Graphics: A Survey: Inverse Kinematics Techniques in Computer Graphics\nInverse kinematics (IK) is the use of kinematic equations to determine the joint parameters of a manipulator so that the end effector moves to a desired position; IK can be applied in many areas, including robotics, engineering, computer graphics and video games. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of the IK problem and the solutions developed over the years from the computer graphics point of view. The paper starts with the definition of forward and IK, their mathematical formulations and explains how to distinguish the unsolvable cases, indicating when a solution is available. The IK literature in this report is divided into four main categories: the analytical, the numerical, the data\u2010driven and the hybrid methods. A timeline illustrating key methods is presented, explaining how the IK approaches have progressed over the years. The most popular IK methods are discussed with regard to their performance, computational cost and the smoothness of their resulting postures, while we suggest which IK family of solvers is best suited for particular problems. Finally, we indicate the limitations of the current IK methodologies and propose future research directions.\n\n3. A Fast Inverse Kinematics Algorithm for Joint Animation\nAbstractThe cyclic coordinate descent(CCD) is a well-known algorithm used for inverse kinematics solutions in multi-joint chains. CCD algorithm can be easily implemented, but it can take a series of iterations before converging to a solution and also generate improper joint rotations. This paper presents a novel Target Triangle algorithm that can fast decides orientation and angle of joint rotation, and eliminates problems associated with improper and large angle rotations. Experimental results are presented to show the performance benefits of the proposed algorithm over CCD methods\n\n4. Style-based inverse kinematics\nThis paper presents an inverse kinematics system based on a learned model of human poses. Given a set of constraints, our system can produce the most likely pose satisfying those constraints, in real-time. Training the model on different input data leads to different styles of IK. The model is represented as a probability distribution over the space of all possible poses. This means that our IK system can generate any pose, but prefers poses that are most similar to the space of poses in the training data. We represent the probability with a novel model called a Scaled Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model. The parameters of the model are all learned automatically; no manual tuning is required for the learning component of the system. We additionally describe a novel procedure for interpolating between styles.Our style-based IK can replace conventional IK, wherever it is used in computer animation and computer vision. We demonstrate our system in the context of a number of applications: interactive character posing, trajectory keyframing, real-time motion capture with missing markers, and posing from a 2D image.\n\n5. Human upper-body inverse kinematics for increased embodiment in consumer-grade virtual reality\nHaving a virtual body can increase embodiment in virtual reality (VR) applications. However, comsumer-grade VR falls short of delivering sufficient sensory information for full-body motion capture. Consequently, most current VR applications do not even show arms, although they are often in the field of view. We address this shortcoming with a novel human upper-body inverse kinematics algorithm specifically targeted at tracking from head and hand sensors only. We present heuristics for elbow positioning depending on the shoulder-to-hand distance and for avoiding reaching unnatural joint limits. Our results show that our method increases the accuracy compared to general inverse kinematics applied to human arms with the same tracking input. In a user study, participants preferred our method over displaying disembodied hands without arms, but also over a more expensive motion capture system. In particular, our study shows that virtual arms animated with our inverse kinematics system can be used for applications involving heavy arm movement. We demonstrate that our method can not only be used to increase embodiment, but can also support interaction involving arms or shoulders, such as holding up a shield.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of motion synthesis, particularly for anthropomorphic limbs, the first paper presents a suite of inverse kinematics algorithms that leverage a combination of analytical and numerical methods to solve complex constraints, such as position and orientation, with a focus on the redundancy of the system, demonstrating a more reliable and interactive approach (1). The second paper provides a comprehensive survey of inverse kinematics techniques, distinguishing between analytical, numerical, data-driven, and hybrid methods, and discusses the performance and computational cost of various IK solvers, offering a nuanced overview of the field and suggestive of future research directions (2). The third paper introduces a fast inverse kinematics algorithm for joint animation, the Target Triangle algorithm, which efficiently determines joint rotations while avoiding improper angles, thus enhancing the performance and smoothness of animations (3). The fourth paper departs from traditional IK methods by proposing a style-based system that utilizes a Scaled Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model to learn from training data, enabling the generation of plausible poses and the facility to interpolate between different IK styles, thus expanding the application of IK beyond conventional animation and into areas like 2D image posing (4). Lastly, the fifth paper tackles the challenge of tracking human upper-body movement in VR, presenting an inverse kinematics algorithm that maximizes accuracy with minimal sensor input, leading to more natural and immersive virtual representations of human anatomy, as evidenced by user preference studies (5). Together, these papers contribute to the diverse and evolving landscape of motion synthesis techniques, each offering a unique perspective on how to bridge the gap between digital models and real-world interactions.",

WSD corpora are typically small in size, owing to an expensive annotation process. Current supervised WSD methods treat senses as discrete labels and also resort to predicting the Most-Frequent-Sense (MFS) for words unseen during training. This leads to poor performance on rare and unseen senses. To overcome this challenge, we propose Extended WSD Incorporating Sense Embeddings (EWISE), a supervised model to perform WSD by predicting over a continuous sense embedding space as opposed to a discrete label space. This allows EWISE to generalize over both seen and unseen senses, thus achieving generalized zero-shot learning. To obtain target sense embeddings, EWISE utilizes sense definitions. EWISE learns a novel sentence encoder for sense definitions by using WordNet relations and also ConvE, a recently proposed knowledge graph embedding method. We also compare EWISE against other sentence encoders pretrained on large corpora to generate definition embeddings. EWISE achieves new state-of-the-art WSD performance.\n\n2. multi-task identification of entities, relations, and coreference for scientific knowledge graph construction\nWe introduce a multi-task setup of identifying entities, relations, and coreference clusters in scientific articles. We create SciERC, a dataset that includes annotations for all three tasks and develop a unified framework called SciIE with shared span representations. The multi-task setup reduces cascading errors between tasks and leverages cross-sentence relations through coreference links. Experiments show that our multi-task model outperforms previous models in scientific information extraction without using any domain-specific features. We further show that the framework supports construction of a scientific knowledge graph, which we use to analyze information in scientific literature.\n\n3. the wisdom of minority: unsupervised slot filling validation based on multi-dimensional truth-finding\nInformation Extraction using multiple information sources and systems is beneficial due to multisource/system consolidation and challenging due to the resulting inconsistency and redundancy. We integrate IE and truth-finding research and present a novel unsupervised multi-dimensional truth finding framework which incorporates signals from multiple sources, multiple systems and multiple pieces of evidence by knowledge graph construction through multi-layer deep linguistic analysis. Experiments on the case study of Slot Filling Validation demonstrate that our approach can find truths accurately (9.4% higher F-score than supervised methods) and efficiently (finding 90% truths with only one half the cost of a baseline without credibility estimation).\n\n4. integration of knowledge graph embedding into topic modeling with hierarchical dirichlet process\nLeveraging domain knowledge is an effective strategy for enhancing the quality of inferred low-dimensional representations of documents by topic models. In this paper, we develop topic modeling with knowledge graph embedding (TMKGE), a Bayesian nonparametric model to employ knowledge graph (KG) embedding in the context of topic modeling, for extracting more coherent topics. Specifically, we build a hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) based model to flexibly borrow information from KG to improve the interpretability of topics. An efficient online variational inference method based on a stick-breaking construction of HDP is developed for TMKGE, making TMKGE suitable for large document corpora and KGs. Experiments on three public datasets illustrate the superior performance of TMKGE in terms of topic coherence and document classification accuracy, compared to state-of-the-art topic modeling methods.\n\n5. compare to the knowledge: graph neural fake news detection with external knowledge\nNowadays, fake news detection, which aims to verify whether a news document is trusted or fake, has become urgent and important. Most existing methods rely heavily on linguistic and semantic features from the news content, and fail to effectively exploit external knowledge which could help determine whether the news document is trusted. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end graph neural model called CompareNet, which compares the news to the knowledge base (KB) through entities for fake news detection. Considering that fake news detection is correlated with topics, we also incorporate topics to enrich the news representation. Specifically, we first construct a directed heterogeneous document graph for each news incorporating topics and entities. Based on the graph, we develop a heterogeneous graph attention network for learning the topic-enriched news representation as well as the contextual entity representations that encode the semantics of the news content. The contextual entity representations are then compared to the corresponding KB-based entity representations through a carefully designed entity comparison network, to capture the consistency between the news content and KB. Finally, the topic-enriched news representation combining the entity comparison features is fed into a fake news classifier. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that CompareNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In addressing the challenge of entity linking across various domains and text types, recent methodologies have leveraged the power of embeddings, knowledge graphs, and graph neural networks. EWISE (1) introduces a supervised model that predicts entity senses using sense definition embeddings, thereby generalizing beyond seen senses and achieving zero-shot learning. This approach is complemented by the multi-task setup of SciERC (2), which annotates entities, relations, and coreference clusters in scientific articles, employing shared span representations to reduce errors between tasks and support knowledge graph construction. Similarly, the unsupervised framework in (3) integrates IE with truth-finding, utilizing knowledge graph construction through multi-layer deep linguistic analysis to identify and validate entities and their relationships efficiently. In the realm of topic modeling, TMKGE (4) combines knowledge graph embedding with a hierarchical Dirichlet process to enhance topic coherence and document classification accuracy, demonstrating the benefits of incorporating external knowledge into topic models. Lastly, CompareNet (5) proposes a graph neural model that compares news content to knowledge bases, incorporating topics and entities to enrich document representations and detect fake news through entity comparison networks. Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of integrating domain knowledge, embeddings, and graph-based representations to improve the accuracy and efficiency of entity linking tasks across various applications (1-5).",

Experiments on the case study of Slot Filling Validation demonstrate that our approach can find truths accurately (9.4% higher F-score than supervised methods) and efficiently (finding 90% truths with only one half the cost of a baseline without credibility estimation).\n\n4. integration of knowledge graph embedding into topic modeling with hierarchical dirichlet process\nLeveraging domain knowledge is an effective strategy for enhancing the quality of inferred low-dimensional representations of documents by topic models. In this paper, we develop topic modeling with knowledge graph embedding (TMKGE), a Bayesian nonparametric model to employ knowledge graph (KG) embedding in the context of topic modeling, for extracting more coherent topics. Specifically, we build a hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) based model to flexibly borrow information from KG to improve the interpretability of topics. An efficient online variational inference method based on a stick-breaking construction of HDP is developed for TMKGE, making TMKGE suitable for large document corpora and KGs. Experiments on three public datasets illustrate the superior performance of TMKGE in terms of topic coherence and document classification accuracy, compared to state-of-the-art topic modeling methods.\n\n5. compare to the knowledge: graph neural fake news detection with external knowledge\nNowadays, fake news detection, which aims to verify whether a news document is trusted or fake, has become urgent and important. Most existing methods rely heavily on linguistic and semantic features from the news content, and fail to effectively exploit external knowledge which could help determine whether the news document is trusted. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end graph neural model called CompareNet, which compares the news to the knowledge base (KB) through entities for fake news detection. Considering that fake news detection is correlated with topics, we also incorporate topics to enrich the news representation. Specifically, we first construct a directed heterogeneous document graph for each news incorporating topics and entities. Based on the graph, we develop a heterogeneous graph attention network for learning the topic-enriched news representation as well as the contextual entity representations that encode the semantics of the news content. The contextual entity representations are then compared to the corresponding KB-based entity representations through a carefully designed entity comparison network, to capture the consistency between the news content and KB. Finally, the topic-enriched news representation combining the entity comparison features is fed into a fake news classifier. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that CompareNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " Recent advancements in entity linking, a critical task in natural language processing, have demonstrated significant strides in enhancing the accuracy and generalization of systems through innovative approaches to word sense disambiguation, knowledge graph construction, and the integration of multiple information sources. EWISE introduces a novel supervised model for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) by predicting over a continuous sense embedding space, showing remarkable performance in zero-shot learning and outperforming traditional methods that limit senses to discrete labels (1). In a similar vein, the SciERC dataset and the SciIE framework address the challenge of identifying entities, relations, and coreference clusters in scientific articles, employing shared span representations to reduce cascading errors and support the construction of scientific knowledge graphs, thereby advancing the field of scientific information extraction (2). The wisdom of minority principle is leveraged in unsupervised slot filling validation, where a multi-dimensional truth-finding framework incorporates signals from multiple sources and systems, achieving higher accuracy and efficiency in information extraction tasks without the need for domain-specific features (3). The integration of knowledge graph embedding into topic modeling with hierarchical Dirichlet process, presented as TMKGE, improves the interpretability of topics and document classification accuracy by borrowing information from knowledge graphs, indicating the utility of leveraging domain knowledge in topic modeling (4). Lastly, CompareNet, a novel graph neural model, excels in fake news detection by comparing news content to knowledge bases through entities and topics, demonstrating superior performance to existing methods (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the importance of multi-modal information integration, representational enhancements, and knowledge graph utilization in advancing entity linking and related tasks.\n\n",

WSD corpora are typically small in size, owing to an expensive annotation process. Current supervised WSD methods treat senses as discrete labels and also resort to predicting the Most-Frequent-Sense (MFS) for words unseen during training. This leads to poor performance on rare and unseen senses. To overcome this challenge, we propose Extended WSD Incorporating Sense Embeddings (EWISE), a supervised model to perform WSD by predicting over a continuous sense embedding space as opposed to a discrete label space. This allows EWISE to generalize over both seen and unseen senses, thus achieving generalized zero-shot learning. To obtain target sense embeddings, EWISE utilizes sense definitions. EWISE learns a novel sentence encoder for sense definitions by using WordNet relations and also ConvE, a recently proposed knowledge graph embedding method. We also compare EWISE against other sentence encoders pretrained on large corpora to generate definition embeddings. EWISE achieves new state-of-the-art WSD performance.\n\n2. multi-task identification of entities, relations, and coreference for scientific knowledge graph construction\nWe introduce a multi-task setup of identifying entities, relations, and coreference clusters in scientific articles. We create SciERC, a dataset that includes annotations for all three tasks and develop a unified framework called SciIE with shared span representations. The multi-task setup reduces cascading errors between tasks and leverages cross-sentence relations through coreference links. Experiments show that our multi-task model outperforms previous models in scientific information extraction without using any domain-specific features. We further show that the framework supports construction of a scientific knowledge graph, which we use to analyze information in scientific literature.\n\n3. the wisdom of minority: unsupervised slot filling validation based on multi-dimensional truth-finding\nInformation Extraction using multiple information sources and systems is beneficial due to multisource/system consolidation and challenging due to the resulting inconsistency and redundancy.

ExtruOnt: An ontology for describing a\u00a0type\u00a0of manufacturing machine for\u00a0Industry\u00a04.0\u00a0systems\nSemantically rich descriptions of manufacturing machines, offered in a machine-interpretable code, can provide interesting benefits in Industry 4.0 scenarios. However, the lack of that type of descriptions is evident. In this paper we present the development effort made to build an ontology, called ExtruOnt, for describing a type of manufacturing machine, more precisely, a type that performs an extrusion process (extruder). Although the scope of the ontology is restricted to a concrete domain, it could be used as a model for the development of other ontologies for describing manufacturing machines in Industry 4.0 scenarios. The terms of the ExtruOnt ontology provide different types of information related with an extruder, which are reflected in distinct modules that constitute the ontology. Thus, it contains classes and properties for expressing descriptions about components of an extruder, spatial connections, features, and 3D representations of those components, and finally the sensors used to capture indicators about the performance of this type of machine. The ontology development process has been carried out in close collaboration with domain experts.\n\n2. SAREF4INMA: A SAREF extension for the industry and manufacturing domain\nThe IoT landscape is characterized by a fragmentation of standards, platforms and technologies, often scattered among different vertical domains. To prevent the market to continue to be fragmented and power-less, a protocol-independent semantic layer can serve as enabler of interoperability among the various smart devices from different manufacturers that co-exist in a specific industry domain, but also across different domains. To that end, the SAREF ontology was created in 2015 with the intention to interconnect data, enabling the communication between IoT devices that use different protocols and standards. A number of industrial sectors consequently expressed their interest to extend SAREF into their domains in order to fill the gaps of the semantics not yet covered by their communication protocols. Therefore, the SAREF4INMA ontology was recently created to extend SAREF for describing the Smart Industry & Manufacturing domain. SAREF4INMA is based on several standards and IoT initiatives, as well as on real use cases, and includes classes, properties and instances specifically created to cover the industry and manufacturing domain. This work describes the approach followed to develop this ontology, specifies its requirements and also includes a practical example of how to use it.\n\n3. IoT-Lite: a lightweight semantic model for the internet of things and its use with dynamic semantics\nOver the past few years, the semantics community has developed several ontologies to describe concepts and relationships for internet of things (IoT) applications. A key problem is that most of the IoT-related semantic descriptions are not as widely adopted as expected. One of the main concerns of users and developers is that semantic techniques increase the complexity and processing time, and therefore, they are unsuitable for dynamic and responsive environments such as the IoT. To address this concern, we propose IoT-Lite, an instantiation of the semantic sensor network ontology to describe key IoT concepts allowing interoperability and discovery of sensory data in heterogeneous IoT platforms by a lightweight semantics. We propose 10 rules for good and scalable semantic model design and follow them to create IoT-Lite. We also demonstrate the scalability of IoT-Lite by providing some experimental analysis and assess IoT-Lite against another solution in terms of round trip time performance for query-response times. We have linked IoT-Lite with stream annotation ontology, to allow queries over stream data annotations, and we have also added dynamic semantics in the form of MathML annotations to IoT-Lite. Dynamic semantics allows the annotation of spatio-temporal values, reducing storage requirements and therefore the response time for queries. Dynamic semantics stores mathematical formulas to recover estimated values when actual values are missing.The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Commission\u2019s in the Seventh Framework Programme for the FIWARE project under Grant Agreement No. 632893 and in the H2020 for FIESTA-IoT project under Grant Agreement No. CNECT-ICT-643943\n\n4. SOSA: A lightweight ontology for sensors, observations, samples, and actuators\nInternational audienceThe Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator (SOSA) ontology provides a formal but lightweight general-purpose specification for modellingthe interaction between the entities involved in the acts of observation, actuation, and sampling. SOSA is the result of rethinking the W3C-XG Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology based on changes in scope and target audience, technical developments, and lessons learned over the past years. SOSA also acts as a replacement of SSN\u2019s Stimulus Sensor Observation (SSO) core. It has been developed by the first joint working group of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) on Spatial Data on the Web. In this work, we motivate the need for SOSA, provide an overview of the main classes and properties, and briefly discuss its integration with the new release of the SSN ontology as well as various other alignments to specifications such as OGC\u2019s Observations and Measurements (O&M), Dolce-Ultralite (DUL), and other prominent ontologies. We will also touch upon common modelling problems and application areas related to publishing and searching observation, sampling, and actuation data on the Web. The SOSA ontology and standard can be accessed at https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/\n\n5. AutomationML Ontology: Modeling Cyber-Physical Systems for Industry 4.0\nWe present an AutomationML ontology (AMLO) that covers the CAEX part of the AutomationML standard. The AutomationML data format facilitates the engineering data exchange during industrial systems design. Having a semantic representation of the AutomationML standard allows industrial practitioners to interlink and integrate heterogeneous data more efficiently and to benefit from the Semantic Web tools and technology stack, while at the same time, using a familiar domain-specific conceptualization. Compared to earlier efforts for semantically representing AutomationML, AMLO (a) covers the entire CAEX standard, and not just portions relevant for a use case; (b) has been developed following best practices for ontology engineering; and (c) is made openly available for the community by following latest guidelines on resource sharing and publishing. We describe AMLO and demonstrate its use in reallife scenarios for improving engineering processes in CyberPhysical System design.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The methodologies employed in the development of semantic IoT ontologies across different domains demonstrate a consistent reliance on the principles of ontology engineering and standardization to enhance interoperability and semantic interconnectivity. The ExtruOnt ontology, focused on manufacturing machines, employed a collaborative approach with domain experts to create a machine-interpretable code that described various facets of an extruder, including its components, spatial connections, and sensor integration (1). Similarly, SAREF4INMA extended the SAREF ontology for the industry and manufacturing domain, incorporating real use cases and industry-specific classes and properties to foster semantic interoperability (2). IoT-Lite, in contrast, adopted a lightweight semantics approach, adhering to ontology design rules and integrating dynamic semantics to improve query response times in IoT environments, thus catering to the needs of dynamic, responsive systems (3). The SOSA ontology revisited the SSN ontology, focusing on the interaction between entities in observation, actuation, and sampling, and offering a general-purpose specification that could be applied across various domains (4). Lastly, the AutomationML Ontology (AMLO) followed a domain-specific conceptualization to model cyber-physical systems within the Industry 4.0 framework, adhering to semantic web tools and standards to facilitate efficient data exchange and integration (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of integrating domain expertise, standardization, and lightweight semantics to enable seamless semantic communication across diverse IoT and manufacturing applications.\n\n",

ExtruOnt: An ontology for describing a\u00a0type\u00a0of manufacturing machine for\u00a0Industry\u00a04.0\u00a0systems\nSemantically rich descriptions of manufacturing machines, offered in a machine-interpretable code, can provide interesting benefits in Industry 4.0 scenarios. However, the lack of that type of descriptions is evident. In this paper we present the development effort made to build an ontology, called ExtruOnt, for describing a type of manufacturing machine, more precisely, a type that performs an extrusion process (extruder). Although the scope of the ontology is restricted to a concrete domain, it could be used as a model for the development of other ontologies for describing manufacturing machines in Industry 4.0 scenarios. The terms of the ExtruOnt ontology provide different types of information related with an extruder, which are reflected in distinct modules that constitute the ontology. Thus, it contains classes and properties for expressing descriptions about components of an extruder, spatial connections, features, and 3D representations of those components, and finally the sensors used to capture indicators about the performance of this type of machine. The ontology development process has been carried out in close collaboration with domain experts.\n\n2. SAREF4INMA: A SAREF extension for the industry and manufacturing domain\nThe IoT landscape is characterized by a fragmentation of standards, platforms and technologies, often scattered among different vertical domains. To prevent the market to continue to be fragmented and power-less, a protocol-independent semantic layer can serve as enabler of interoperability among the various smart devices from different manufacturers that co-exist in a specific industry domain, but also across different domains. To that end, the SAREF ontology was created in 2015 with the intention to interconnect data, enabling the communication between IoT devices that use different protocols and standards. A number of industrial sectors consequently expressed their interest to extend SAREF into their domains in order to fill the gaps of the semantics not yet covered by their communication protocols. Therefore, the SAREF4INMA ontology was recently created to extend SAREF for describing the Smart Industry & Manufacturing domain. SAREF4INMA is based on several standards and IoT initiatives, as well as on real use cases, and includes classes, properties and instances specifically created to cover the industry and manufacturing domain. This work describes the approach followed to develop this ontology, specifies its requirements and also includes a practical example of how to use it.\n\n3. IoT-Lite: a lightweight semantic model for the internet of things and its use with dynamic semantics\nOver the past few years, the semantics community has developed several ontologies to describe concepts and relationships for internet of things (IoT) applications. A key problem is that most of the IoT-related semantic descriptions are not as widely adopted as expected. One of the main concerns of users and developers is that semantic techniques increase the complexity and processing time, and therefore, they are unsuitable for dynamic and responsive environments such as the IoT. To address this concern, we propose IoT-Lite, an instantiation of the semantic sensor network ontology to describe key IoT concepts allowing interoperability and discovery of sensory data in heterogeneous IoT platforms by a lightweight semantics. We propose 10 rules for good and scalable semantic model design and follow them to create IoT-Lite. We also demonstrate the scalability of IoT-Lite by providing some experimental analysis and assess IoT-Lite against another solution in terms of round trip time performance for query-response times. We have linked IoT-Lite with stream annotation ontology, to allow queries over stream data annotations, and we have also added dynamic semantics in the form of MathML annotations to IoT-Lite. Dynamic semantics allows the annotation of spatio-temporal values, reducing storage requirements and therefore the response time for queries. Dynamic semantics stores mathematical formulas to recover estimated values when actual values are missing.The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Commission\u2019s in the Seventh Framework Programme for the FIWARE project under Grant Agreement No. 632893 and in the H2020 for FIESTA-IoT project under Grant Agreement No. CNECT-ICT-643943\n\n4. SOSA: A lightweight ontology for sensors, observations, samples, and actuators\nInternational audienceThe Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator (SOSA) ontology provides a formal but lightweight general-purpose specification for modellingthe interaction between the entities involved in the acts of observation, actuation, and sampling. SOSA is the result of rethinking the W3C-XG Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology based on changes in scope and target audience, technical developments, and lessons learned over the past years. SOSA also acts as a replacement of SSN\u2019s Stimulus Sensor Observation (SSO) core. It has been developed by the first joint working group of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) on Spatial Data on the Web. In this work, we motivate the need for SOSA, provide an overview of the main classes and properties, and briefly discuss its integration with the new release of the SSN ontology as well as various other alignments to specifications such as OGC\u2019s Observations and Measurements (O&M), Dolce-Ultralite (DUL), and other prominent ontologies. We will also touch upon common modelling problems and application areas related to publishing and searching observation, sampling, and actuation data on the Web. The SOSA ontology and standard can be accessed at https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/\n\n5. AutomationML Ontology: Modeling Cyber-Physical Systems for Industry 4.0\nWe present an AutomationML ontology (AMLO) that covers the CAEX part of the AutomationML standard. The AutomationML data format facilitates the engineering data exchange during industrial systems design. Having a semantic representation of the AutomationML standard allows industrial practitioners to interlink and integrate heterogeneous data more efficiently and to benefit from the Semantic Web tools and technology stack, while at the same time, using a familiar domain-specific conceptualization. Compared to earlier efforts for semantically representing AutomationML, AMLO (a) covers the entire CAEX standard, and not just portions relevant for a use case; (b) has been developed following best practices for ontology engineering; and (c) is made openly available for the community by following latest guidelines on resource sharing and publishing. We describe AMLO and demonstrate its use in reallife scenarios for improving engineering processes in CyberPhysical System design.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The integration of semantic technologies in the realm of the Internet of Things (IoT) for industrial applications is emerging as a critical development that enhances interoperability, data description, and the enrichment of cyber-physical systems. The ExtruOnt ontology provides a detailed description of a specific manufacturing machine, emphasizing the importance of machine components, spatial connections, and sensor integration, which can serve as a model for other ontologies within the Industry 4.0 landscape (1). Complementing this, the SAREF4INMA ontology extends the SAREF framework to the industrial sector, filling gaps in semantic descriptions and facilitating communication between diverse IoT devices, thus fostering domain-specific interoperability (2). The lightweight IoT-Lite ontology emphasizes the necessity for scalable and adopted semantic models in IoT, proposing rules for their design and demonstrating its utility in dynamic environments (3). Similarly, the SOSA ontology offers a lightweight, general-purpose specification for modeling interactions in observation, actuation, and sampling, catering to a broader audience and enhancing the integration of various ontologies within the H2020 FIESTA-IoT project (4). Lastly, the AutomationML ontology (AMLO) focuses on the cyber-physical systems within industries, using semantic representation to bridge heterogeneous data and improve engineering processes, exemplifying the application of semantics in the practical context of Industry 4.0 (5). Collectively, these ontologies underscore the transformative potential of semantic IoT in achieving semantic interoperability, reducing complexity, and enhancing the functionality of smart industrial systems.",

The COVID-19 pandemic and subjective well-being: longitudinal evidence on satisfaction with work and family\nABSTRACT This paper provides a timely evaluation of whether the main COVID-19 lockdown policies \u2013 remote work, short-time work and closure of schools and childcare \u2013 have an immediate effect on the German population in terms of changes in satisfaction with work and family life. Relying on individual level panel data collected before and during the lockdown, we examine (1) how family satisfaction and work satisfaction of individuals have changed over the lockdown period, and (2) how lockdown-driven changes in the labour market situation (i.e. working remotely and being sent on short-time work) have affected satisfactions. We apply first-difference regressions for mothers, fathers, and persons without children. Our results show a general decrease in family satisfaction. We also find an overall decline in work satisfaction which is most pronounced for mothers and those without children who have to switch to short-time work. In contrast, fathers' well-being is less affected negatively and their family satisfaction even increased after changing to short-time work. We conclude that while the lockdown circumstances generally have a negative effect on the satisfaction with work and family of individuals in Germany, effects differ between childless persons, mothers, and fathers with the latter being least negatively affected.\n\n2. Socioeconomic status and well-being during COVID-19: A resource-based examination.\nThe authors assess levels and within-person changes in psychological well-being (i.e., depressive symptoms and life satisfaction) from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic for individuals in the United States, in general and by socioeconomic status (SES). The data is from 2 surveys of 1,143 adults from RAND Corporation's nationally representative American Life Panel, the first administered between April-June, 2019 and the second during the initial peak of the pandemic in the United States in April, 2020. Depressive symptoms during the pandemic were higher than population norms before the pandemic. Depressive symptoms increased from before to during COVID-19 and life satisfaction decreased. Individuals with higher education experienced a greater increase in depressive symptoms and a greater decrease in life satisfaction from before to during COVID-19 in comparison to those with lower education. Supplemental analysis illustrates that income had a curvilinear relationship with changes in well-being, such that individuals at the highest levels of income experienced a greater decrease in life satisfaction from before to during COVID-19 than individuals with lower levels of income. We draw on conservation of resources theory and the theory of fundamental social causes to examine four key mechanisms (perceived financial resources, perceived control, interpersonal resources, and COVID-19-related knowledge/news consumption) underlying the relationship between SES and well-being during COVID-19. These resources explained changes in well-being for the sample as a whole but did not provide insight into why individuals of higher education experienced a greater decline in well-being from before to during COVID-19.

An analysis of changes in stress and well-being in Switzerland\nABSTRACT This study analyses the consequences of the Covid-19 crisis on stress and well-being in Switzerland. In particular, we assess whether vulnerable groups in terms of social isolation, increased workload and limited socioeconomic resources are affected more than others. Using longitudinal data from the Swiss Household Panel, including a specific Covid-19 study, we estimate change score models to predict changes in perceived stress and life satisfaction at the end of the semi-lockdown in comparison to before the crisis. We find no general change in life satisfaction and a small decrease in stress. Yet, in line with our expectations, more vulnerable groups in terms of social isolation (young adults, Covid-19 risk group members, individuals without a partner), workload (women) and socioeconomic resources (unemployed and those who experienced a deteriorating financial situation) reported a decrease in life satisfaction. Stress levels decreased most strongly among high earners, workers on short-time work and the highly educated.\n\n4. Parental well-being in times of Covid-19 in Germany\nAbstractWe examine the effects of Covid-19 and related restrictions on individuals with dependent children in Germany. We specifically focus on the role of day care center and school closures, which may be regarded as a \u201cdisruptive exogenous shock\u201d to family life. We make use of a novel representative survey of parental well-being collected in May and June 2020 in Germany, when schools and day care centers were closed but while other measures had been relaxed and new infections were low. In our descriptive analysis, we compare well-being during this period with a pre-crisis period for different groups. In a difference-in-differences design, we compare the change for individuals with children to the change for individuals without children, accounting for unrelated trends as well as potential survey mode and context effects. We find that the crisis lowered the relative well-being of individuals with children, especially for individuals with young children, for women, and for persons with lower secondary schooling qualifications. Our results suggest that public policy measures taken to contain Covid-19 can have large effects on family well-being, with implications for child development and parental labor market outcomes.\n\n5. Up and About: Older Adults\u2019 Well-being During the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Swedish Longitudinal Study\nAbstract  Objectives To investigate early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic related to (a) levels of worry, risk perception, and social distancing; (b) longitudinal effects on well-being; and (c) effects of worry, risk perception, and social distancing on well-being.   Methods We analyzed annual changes in four aspects of well-being over 5 years (2015\u20132020): life satisfaction, financial satisfaction, self-rated health, and loneliness in a subsample (n = 1,071, aged 65\u201371) from a larger survey of Swedish older adults. The 2020 wave, collected March 26\u2013April 2, included measures of worry, risk perception, and social distancing in response to COVID-19.   Results (a) In relation to COVID-19: 44.9% worried about health, 69.5% about societal consequences, 25.1% about financial consequences; 86.4% perceived a high societal risk, 42.3% a high risk of infection, and 71.2% reported high levels of social distancing. (b) Well-being remained stable (life satisfaction and loneliness) or even increased (self-rated health and financial satisfaction) in 2020 compared to previous years. (c) More worry about health and financial consequences was related to lower scores in all four well-being measures. Higher societal worry and more social distancing were related to higher well-being.   Discussion In the early stage of the pandemic, Swedish older adults on average rated their well-being as high as, or even higher than, previous years. However, those who worried more reported lower well-being. Our findings speak to the resilience, but also heterogeneity, among older adults during the pandemic. Further research, on a broad range of health factors and long-term psychological consequences, is needed.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In addressing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on well-being, the methodologies employed across five studies provide a multifaceted view of the phenomenon. The first study utilizes longitudinal panel data with first-difference regressions to evaluate the changes in satisfaction with work and family among German individuals during the lockdown, focusing on the effects of labor market changes (1). The second paper employs a similar design with two surveys administered before and during the pandemic to assess changes in psychological well-being among US individuals, applying conservation of resources theory to explore the mechanisms behind socioeconomic status and well-being (2). A third study utilizes a longitudinal dataset from Switzerland to analyze changes in stress and well-being among various socio-economic and demographic groups, employing change score models to predict well-being outcomes (3). The fourth paper examines the crisis's effects on German parents using a novel parental well-being survey, adopting a difference-in-differences design to compare well-being changes among individuals with and without children (4). Lastly, the fifth study investigates the well-being of Swedish older adults over five years, including a subsample in the COVID-19 period, and applies regression analysis to evaluate the relationships between worry, risk perception, and social distancing with well-being outcomes (5). These methodologies, while diverse, share a common reliance on longitudinal and survey data to capture changes in well-being over time, with some incorporating psychological and socio-economic indicators to explore the nuanced impacts of the pandemic on different populations' well-being. Collectively, these studies enhance our understanding of the dynamic nature of well-being during the pandemic, highlighting the importance of contextual factors and individual differences in resilience and vulnerability.\n\n",

        "inference": " The COVID-19 pandemic has had a pervasive negative impact on well-being, as evidenced by studies across different countries and populations. Longitudinal research in Germany has shown a decrease in family satisfaction and work satisfaction, particularly among mothers and those without children who had to switch to short-time work, while fathers' well-being was less affected (1). Similarly, in the United States, depressive symptoms increased and life satisfaction decreased during the pandemic, with higher education associated with a greater decline in well-being (2). In Switzerland, vulnerable groups, such as young adults, women, the unemployed, and those with lower secondary schooling qualifications reported a decrease in life satisfaction, despite a slight decrease in perceived stress (3). Parental well-being in Germany was also found to be lower, particularly among women and people with young children, possibly due to the disruption caused by school and daycare center closures (4). Lastly, in Sweden, older adults' well-being remained stable or improved in the early stages of the pandemic, but those who worried about health and financial consequences reported lower well-being (5). These studies collectively highlight the importance of social support, economic stability, and individual resilience in maintaining well-being amid the pandemic's challenges. The negative effects on well-being have been linked to factors such as increased workload, financial insecurity, social isolation, and the stress of adapting to new restrictions (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Understanding and addressing these factors will be crucial for mitigating the long-term consequences of the pandemic on individual and community well-being.\n\n",

Socioeconomic status and well-being during COVID-19: A resource-based examination.\nThe authors assess levels and within-person changes in psychological well-being (i.e., depressive symptoms and life satisfaction) from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic for individuals in the United States, in general and by socioeconomic status (SES). The data is from 2 surveys of 1,143 adults from RAND Corporation's nationally representative American Life Panel, the first administered between April-June, 2019 and the second during the initial peak of the pandemic in the United States in April, 2020. Depressive symptoms during the pandemic were higher than population norms before the pandemic. Depressive symptoms increased from before to during COVID-19 and life satisfaction decreased. Individuals with higher education experienced a greater increase in depressive symptoms and a greater decrease in life satisfaction from before to during COVID-19 in comparison to those with lower education. Supplemental analysis illustrates that income had a curvilinear relationship with changes in well-being, such that individuals at the highest levels of income experienced a greater decrease in life satisfaction from before to during COVID-19 than individuals with lower levels of income. We draw on conservation of resources theory and the theory of fundamental social causes to examine four key mechanisms (perceived financial resources, perceived control, interpersonal resources, and COVID-19-related knowledge/news consumption) underlying the relationship between SES and well-being during COVID-19. These resources explained changes in well-being for the sample as a whole but did not provide insight into why individuals of higher education experienced a greater decline in well-being from before to during COVID-19.

An analysis of changes in stress and well-being in Switzerland\nABSTRACT This study analyses the consequences of the Covid-19 crisis on stress and well-being in Switzerland. In particular, we assess whether vulnerable groups in terms of social isolation, increased workload and limited socioeconomic resources are affected more than others. Using longitudinal data from the Swiss Household Panel, including a specific Covid-19 study, we estimate change score models to predict changes in perceived stress and life satisfaction at the end of the semi-lockdown in comparison to before the crisis. We find no general change in life satisfaction and a small decrease in stress. Yet, in line with our expectations, more vulnerable groups in terms of social isolation (young adults, Covid-19 risk group members, individuals without a partner), workload (women) and socioeconomic resources (unemployed and those who experienced a deteriorating financial situation) reported a decrease in life satisfaction. Stress levels decreased most strongly among high earners, workers on short-time work and the highly educated.\n\n4. Parental well-being in times of Covid-19 in Germany\nAbstractWe examine the effects of Covid-19 and related restrictions on individuals with dependent children in Germany. We specifically focus on the role of day care center and school closures, which may be regarded as a \u201cdisruptive exogenous shock\u201d to family life. We make use of a novel representative survey of parental well-being collected in May and June 2020 in Germany, when schools and day care centers were closed but while other measures had been relaxed and new infections were low. In our descriptive analysis, we compare well-being during this period with a pre-crisis period for different groups. In a difference-in-differences design, we compare the change for individuals with children to the change for individuals without children, accounting for unrelated trends as well as potential survey mode and context effects. We find that the crisis lowered the relative well-being of individuals with children, especially for individuals with young children, for women, and for persons with lower secondary schooling qualifications. Our results suggest that public policy measures taken to contain Covid-19 can have large effects on family well-being, with implications for child development and parental labor market outcomes.\n\n5. Up and About: Older Adults\u2019 Well-being During the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Swedish Longitudinal Study\nAbstract  Objectives To investigate early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic related to (a) levels of worry, risk perception, and social distancing; (b) longitudinal effects on well-being; and (c) effects of worry, risk perception, and social distancing on well-being.   Methods We analyzed annual changes in four aspects of well-being over 5 years (2015\u20132020): life satisfaction, financial satisfaction, self-rated health, and loneliness in a subsample (n = 1,071, aged 65\u201371) from a larger survey of Swedish older adults. The 2020 wave, collected March 26\u2013April 2, included measures of worry, risk perception, and social distancing in response to COVID-19.   Results (a) In relation to COVID-19: 44.9% worried about health, 69.5% about societal consequences, 25.1% about financial consequences; 86.4% perceived a high societal risk, 42.3% a high risk of infection, and 71.2% reported high levels of social distancing. (b) Well-being remained stable (life satisfaction and loneliness) or even increased (self-rated health and financial satisfaction) in 2020 compared to previous years. (c) More worry about health and financial consequences was related to lower scores in all four well-being measures. Higher societal worry and more social distancing were related to higher well-being.   Discussion In the early stage of the pandemic, Swedish older adults on average rated their well-being as high as, or even higher than, previous years. However, those who worried more reported lower well-being. Our findings speak to the resilience, but also heterogeneity, among older adults during the pandemic. Further research, on a broad range of health factors and long-term psychological consequences, is needed.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on well-being, as evidenced by numerous studies across different countries. In Germany, the implementation of lockdown policies such as remote work and short-time work negatively affected the satisfaction with work and family life, particularly among women and those without children, although there was no overall decrease in life satisfaction (1). Similarly, in the United States, higher education levels correlated with a greater decline in well-being during the pandemic, and individuals with higher incomes experienced a more profound decrease in life satisfaction due to pandemic-related stressors (2). In Switzerland, vulnerable groups, including young adults, women, the unemployed, and those with decreasing incomes, reported a lower life satisfaction despite a slight decrease in perceived stress (3). Parental well-being in Germany was also affected by the pandemic, with parents of young children, women, and those with lower educational attainment experiencing a higher likelihood of lower well-being (4). Lastly, in Sweden, older adults' well-being remained stable or improved in the early stages of the pandemic, but those who reported higher levels of worry about health and financial consequences had lower well-being, while those who were more socially distanced reported higher well-being (5). These studies collectively underscore the complexity of the pandemic's effects on well-being, highlighting the importance of sociodemographic factors, life circumstances, and psychological responses in the face of global crises.\n\n",

Chinese named entity recognition using role model\nThis paper presents a stochastic model to tackle the problem of Chinese named entity recognition. In this research, we unify component tokens of named entity and their contexts into a generalized role set, which is like part-of-speech (POS). The probabilities of role emission and transition are acquired after machine learning on a role-labeled data set, which is transformed from a hand-corrected corpus after word segmentation and POS tagging are performed. Given an original string, role Viterbi tagging is employed on tokens segmented in the initial process. Then named entities are identified and classified through maximum matching on the best role sequence. In addition, named entity recognition using role model is incorporated along with the unified class-based bigram model for word segmentation. Thus, named entity candidates can be further selected in the final process of Chinese lexical analysis. Various evaluations conducted using one\n\n2. Named entity recognition for chinese social media with jointly trained embeddings\nWe consider the task of named entity recognition for Chinese social media. The long line of work in Chinese NER has focused on formal domains, and NER for social media has been largely restricted to English. We present a new corpus of Weibo messages annotated for both name and nominal mentions. Additionally, we evaluate three types of neural embeddings for representing Chinese text. Finally, we propose a joint training objective for the embeddings that makes use of both (NER) labeled and unlabeled raw text. Our methods yield a 9% improvement over a stateof-the-art baseline.\n\n3. Chinese Named Entity Recognition with Multiple Features\nThis paper proposes a hybrid Chinese named entity recognition model based on multiple features. It differentiates from most of the previous approaches mainly as follows. Firstly, the proposed Hybrid Model integrates coarse particle feature (POS Model) with fine particle feature (Word Model), so that it can overcome the disadvantages of each other. Secondly, in order to reduce the searching space and improve the efficiency, we introduce heuristic human knowledge into statistical model, which could increase the performance of NER significantly. Thirdly, we use three sub-models to respectively describe three kinds of transliterated person name, that is, Japanese, Russian and Euramerican person name, which can improve the performance of PN recognition. From the experimental results on People's Daily testing data, we can conclude that our Hybrid Model is better than the models which only use one kind of features. And the experiments on MET-2 testing data also confirm the above conclusion, which show that our algorithm has consistence on different testing data.\n\n4. The multilingual entity task (MET) overview\nIn November, 1996, the Message Understanding Conference-6 (MUC-6) evaluation of named entity identification demonstrated that systems are approaching human performance on English language texts [10]. Informal and anonymous, the MET provided a new opportunity to assess progress on the same task in Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese. Preliminary results indicate that MET systems in all three languages performed comparably to those of the MUC-6 evaluation in English.\n\n5. Recognizing unregistered names for mandarin word identification\nWord Identification has been an important and active issue in Chinese Natural Language Processing. In this paper, a new mechanism, based on the concept of sublanguage, is proposed for identifying unknown words, especially personal names, in Chinese newspapers. The proposed mechanism includes title-driven name recognition, adaptive dynamic word formation, identification of 2-character and 3-character Chinese names without title. We will show the experimental results for two corpora and compare them with the results by the NTHU's statistic-based system, the only system that we know has attacked the same problem. The experimental results have shown significant improvements over the WI systems without the name identification capability.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The methodologies employed in the named entity recognition (NER) tasks for Chinese text exhibit a variety of approaches, each contributing uniquely to the field. The first study introduces a stochastic model that unifies named entity tokens and their contexts into a generalized role set, which is then used for role emission and transition, with a focus on selecting named entity candidates through maximum matching on the best role sequence (1). Meanwhile, the second paper incorporates neural embeddings into the NER task, proposing a joint training objective that utilizes both labeled and unlabeled raw text to improve the performance of NER, especially in social media contexts (2). The third study presents a hybrid model that combines coarse particle feature (POS Model) and fine particle feature (Word Model), along with heuristic human knowledge to reduce the searching space and enhance efficiency in recognizing both simple and complex named entities (3). In the fourth paper, the Multilingual Entity Task (MET) is discussed, providing an evaluation of NER systems in Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese, highlighting the progress made since the MUC-6 English language evaluation (4). Lastly, the fifth study proposes a mechanism based on sublanguage to identify unknown words, particularly personal names, in Chinese newspapers, focusing on the development of a dynamic word formation system that can adapt to new data (5).

Chinese named entity recognition using role model\nThis paper presents a stochastic model to tackle the problem of Chinese named entity recognition. In this research, we unify component tokens of named entity and their contexts into a generalized role set, which is like part-of-speech (POS). The probabilities of role emission and transition are acquired after machine learning on a role-labeled data set, which is transformed from a hand-corrected corpus after word segmentation and POS tagging are performed. Given an original string, role Viterbi tagging is employed on tokens segmented in the initial process. Then named entities are identified and classified through maximum matching on the best role sequence. In addition, named entity recognition using role model is incorporated along with the unified class-based bigram model for word segmentation. Thus, named entity candidates can be further selected in the final process of Chinese lexical analysis. Various evaluations conducted using one\n\n2. Named entity recognition for chinese social media with jointly trained embeddings\nWe consider the task of named entity recognition for Chinese social media. The long line of work in Chinese NER has focused on formal domains, and NER for social media has been largely restricted to English. We present a new corpus of Weibo messages annotated for both name and nominal mentions. Additionally, we evaluate three types of neural embeddings for representing Chinese text. Finally, we propose a joint training objective for the embeddings that makes use of both (NER) labeled and unlabeled raw text. Our methods yield a 9% improvement over a stateof-the-art baseline.\n\n3. Chinese Named Entity Recognition with Multiple Features\nThis paper proposes a hybrid Chinese named entity recognition model based on multiple features. It differentiates from most of the previous approaches mainly as follows. Firstly, the proposed Hybrid Model integrates coarse particle feature (POS Model) with fine particle feature (Word Model), so that it can overcome the disadvantages of each other. Secondly, in order to reduce the searching space and improve the efficiency, we introduce heuristic human knowledge into statistical model, which could increase the performance of NER significantly. Thirdly, we use three sub-models to respectively describe three kinds of transliterated person name, that is, Japanese, Russian and Euramerican person name, which can improve the performance of PN recognition. From the experimental results on People's Daily testing data, we can conclude that our Hybrid Model is better than the models which only use one kind of features. And the experiments on MET-2 testing data also confirm the above conclusion, which show that our algorithm has consistence on different testing data.\n\n4. The multilingual entity task (MET) overview\nIn November, 1996, the Message Understanding Conference-6 (MUC-6) evaluation of named entity identification demonstrated that systems are approaching human performance on English language texts [10]. Informal and anonymous, the MET provided a new opportunity to assess progress on the same task in Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese. Preliminary results indicate that MET systems in all three languages performed comparably to those of the MUC-6 evaluation in English.\n\n5. Recognizing unregistered names for mandarin word identification\nWord Identification has been an important and active issue in Chinese Natural Language Processing. In this paper, a new mechanism, based on the concept of sublanguage, is proposed for identifying unknown words, especially personal names, in Chinese newspapers. The proposed mechanism includes title-driven name recognition, adaptive dynamic word formation, identification of 2-character and 3-character Chinese names without title. We will show the experimental results for two corpora and compare them with the results by the NTHU's statistic-based system, the only system that we know has attacked the same problem. The experimental results have shown significant improvements over the WI systems without the name identification capability.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of Chinese named entity recognition (NER), the first paper introduces a stochastic model that unifies named entity tokens and their contexts into a role set, akin to part-of-speech (POS) tags, and employs role Viterbi tagging to identify and classify named entities, significantly advancing the field with its integration of class-based bigram models for word segmentation (1). The second paper tackles NER for Chinese social media, presenting a new corpus annotated for both name and nominal mentions, and evaluating neural embeddings for representing Chinese text, leading to a 9% improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline (2). The third paper proposes a hybrid Chinese NER model that combines coarse particle feature (POS Model) with fine particle feature (Word Model), integrates heuristic human knowledge into statistical models, and introduces sub-models for different kinds of transliterated person names, thereby outperforming models that use only one kind of feature (3). The fourth paper provides an overview of the multilingual entity task (MET), which evaluated named entity identification in Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese, demonstrating that systems in these languages approached human performance on English language texts (4). Lastly, the fifth paper introduces a mechanism for identifying unregistered names in Chinese newspapers, focusing on title-driven name recognition and adaptive dynamic word formation, and achieves significant improvements over previous systems for identifying 2-character and 3-character Chinese names without titles (5). Together, these papers significantly contribute to the advancement of NER in Chinese language processing.\n\n",

Cross-lingual Name Tagging and Linking for 282 Languages\nThe ambitious goal of this work is to develop a cross-lingual name tagging and linking framework for 282 languages that exist in Wikipedia. Given a document in any of these languages, our framework is able to identify name mentions, assign a coarse-grained or fine-grained type to each mention, and link it to an English Knowledge Base (KB) if it is linkable. We achieve this goal by performing a series of new KB mining methods: generating \u201csilver-standard\u201d annotations by transferring annotations from English to other languages through cross-lingual links and KB properties, refining annotations through self-training and topic selection, deriving language-specific morphology features from anchor links, and mining word translation pairs from cross-lingual links. Both name tagging and linking results for 282 languages are promising on Wikipedia data and on-Wikipedia data.\n\n2. WiNER: A Wikipedia Annotated Corpus for Named Entity Recognition\nWe revisit the idea of mining Wikipedia in order to generate named-entity annotations. We propose a new methodology that we applied to English Wikipedia to build WiNER, a large, high quality, annotated corpus. We evaluate its usefulness on 6 NER tasks, comparing 4 popular state-of-the art approaches. We show that LSTM-CRF is the approach that benefits the most from our corpus. We report impressive gains with this model when using a small portion of WiNER on top of the CONLL training material. Last, we propose a simple but efficient method for exploiting the full range of WiNER, leading to further improvements.\n\n3. WikiNEuRal: Combined Neural and Knowledge-based Silver Data Creation for Multilingual NER\nMultilingual Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key intermediate task which is needed in many areas of NLP. In this paper, we address the well-known issue of data scarcity in NER, especially relevant when moving to a multilingual scenario, and go beyond current approaches to the creation of multilingual silver data for the task. We exploit the texts of Wikipedia and introduce a new methodology based on the effective combination of knowledge-based approaches and neural models, together with a novel domain adaptation technique, to produce high-quality training corpora for NER. We evaluate our datasets extensively on standard benchmarks for NER, yielding substantial improvements of up to 6 span-based F1-score points over previous state-of-the-art systems for data creation.\n\n4. Learning multilingual named entity recognition from Wikipedia\nAbstractWe automatically create enormous, free and multilingual silver-standard training annotations for named entity recognition (ner) by exploiting the text and structure of Wikipedia. Most ner systems rely on statistical models of annotated data to identify and classify names of people, locations and organisations in text. This dependence on expensive annotation is the knowledge bottleneck our work overcomes.We first classify each Wikipedia article into named entity (ne) types, training and evaluating on 7200 manually-labelled Wikipedia articles across nine languages. Our cross-lingual approach achieves up to 95% accuracy.We transform the links between articles into ne annotations by projecting the target article\u02bcs classifications onto the anchor text. This approach yields reasonable annotations, but does not immediately compete with existing gold-standard data. By inferring additional links and heuristically tweaking the Wikipedia corpora, we better align our automatic annotations to gold standards.We annotate millions of words in nine languages, evaluating English, German, Spanish, Dutch and Russian Wikipedia-trained models against conll shared task data and other gold-standard corpora. Our approach outperforms other approaches to automatic ne annotation (Richman and Schone, 2008 [61], Mika et al., 2008 [46]) competes with gold-standard training when tested on an evaluation corpus from a different source; and performs 10% better than newswire-trained models on manually-annotated Wikipedia text\n\n5. Named Entity Recognition in Wikipedia\nNamed entity recognition (NER) is used in many domains beyond the newswire text that comprises current gold-standard corpora. Recent work has used Wikipedia's link structure to automatically generate near gold-standard annotations. Until now, these resources have only been evaluated on newswire corpora or themselves.    We present the first NER evaluation on a Wikipedia gold standard (WG) corpus. Our analysis of cross-corpus performance on WG shows that Wikipedia text may be a harder NER domain than newswire. We find that an automatic annotation of Wikipedia has high agreement with WG and, when used as training data, outperforms newswire models by up to 7.7%.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In addressing the challenge of multilingual named entity recognition (NER), recent methodologies have leveraged the rich textual data and link structures within Wikipedia to generate and annotate named entities across various languages. The Cross-lingual Name Tagging and Linking framework developed for 282 languages incorporates a series of new KB mining methods, including transferring annotations through cross-lingual links and KB properties, self-training, and topic selection, to achieve name tagging and linking with promising results (1).

Learning multilingual NER from Wikipedia itself involves classifying articles, projecting classifications onto anchor text, and refining annotations through heuristic tweaks and link inference, successfully outperforming existing methods on various corpora (4). Lastly, the Named Entity Recognition in Wikipedia study underscores the challenges in applying existing models to non-newswire domains, highlighting the potential of Wikipedia as a nuanced NER training dataset (5).

The integration of Wikipedia's text and structure, as demonstrated in the learning approach, offers a cost-effective solution to the dependency on expensive annotation by automatically classifying articles and projecting classifications onto anchor text, resulting in reasonable annotations (4). Furthermore, the analysis of cross-corpus performance on Wikipedia gold standards indicates that Wikipedia text might be a more complex NER domain than newswire, requiring tailored models to achieve optimal results (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the significance of innovative silver data creation methods, knowledge-based strategies, and the adaptability of NER systems to varied textual domains in overcoming the obstacles posed by data scarcity and language diversity in NER tasks across multiple languages (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n\n",

Cross-lingual Name Tagging and Linking for 282 Languages\nThe ambitious goal of this work is to develop a cross-lingual name tagging and linking framework for 282 languages that exist in Wikipedia. Given a document in any of these languages, our framework is able to identify name mentions, assign a coarse-grained or fine-grained type to each mention, and link it to an English Knowledge Base (KB) if it is linkable. We achieve this goal by performing a series of new KB mining methods: generating \u201csilver-standard\u201d annotations by transferring annotations from English to other languages through cross-lingual links and KB properties, refining annotations through self-training and topic selection, deriving language-specific morphology features from anchor links, and mining word translation pairs from cross-lingual links. Both name tagging and linking results for 282 languages are promising on Wikipedia data and on-Wikipedia data.\n\n2. WiNER: A Wikipedia Annotated Corpus for Named Entity Recognition\nWe revisit the idea of mining Wikipedia in order to generate named-entity annotations. We propose a new methodology that we applied to English Wikipedia to build WiNER, a large, high quality, annotated corpus. We evaluate its usefulness on 6 NER tasks, comparing 4 popular state-of-the art approaches. We show that LSTM-CRF is the approach that benefits the most from our corpus. We report impressive gains with this model when using a small portion of WiNER on top of the CONLL training material. Last, we propose a simple but efficient method for exploiting the full range of WiNER, leading to further improvements.\n\n3. WikiNEuRal: Combined Neural and Knowledge-based Silver Data Creation for Multilingual NER\nMultilingual Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key intermediate task which is needed in many areas of NLP. In this paper, we address the well-known issue of data scarcity in NER, especially relevant when moving to a multilingual scenario, and go beyond current approaches to the creation of multilingual silver data for the task. We exploit the texts of Wikipedia and introduce a new methodology based on the effective combination of knowledge-based approaches and neural models, together with a novel domain adaptation technique, to produce high-quality training corpora for NER. We evaluate our datasets extensively on standard benchmarks for NER, yielding substantial improvements of up to 6 span-based F1-score points over previous state-of-the-art systems for data creation.\n\n4. Learning multilingual named entity recognition from Wikipedia\nAbstractWe automatically create enormous, free and multilingual silver-standard training annotations for named entity recognition (ner) by exploiting the text and structure of Wikipedia. Most ner systems rely on statistical models of annotated data to identify and classify names of people, locations and organisations in text. This dependence on expensive annotation is the knowledge bottleneck our work overcomes.We first classify each Wikipedia article into named entity (ne) types, training and evaluating on 7200 manually-labelled Wikipedia articles across nine languages. Our cross-lingual approach achieves up to 95% accuracy.We transform the links between articles into ne annotations by projecting the target article\u02bcs classifications onto the anchor text. This approach yields reasonable annotations, but does not immediately compete with existing gold-standard data. By inferring additional links and heuristically tweaking the Wikipedia corpora, we better align our automatic annotations to gold standards.We annotate millions of words in nine languages, evaluating English, German, Spanish, Dutch and Russian Wikipedia-trained models against conll shared task data and other gold-standard corpora. Our approach outperforms other approaches to automatic ne annotation (Richman and Schone, 2008 [61], Mika et al., 2008 [46]) competes with gold-standard training when tested on an evaluation corpus from a different source; and performs 10% better than newswire-trained models on manually-annotated Wikipedia text\n\n5. Named Entity Recognition in Wikipedia\nNamed entity recognition (NER) is used in many domains beyond the newswire text that comprises current gold-standard corpora. Recent work has used Wikipedia's link structure to automatically generate near gold-standard annotations. Until now, these resources have only been evaluated on newswire corpora or themselves.    We present the first NER evaluation on a Wikipedia gold standard (WG) corpus. Our analysis of cross-corpus performance on WG shows that Wikipedia text may be a harder NER domain than newswire. We find that an automatic annotation of Wikipedia has high agreement with WG and, when used as training data, outperforms newswire models by up to 7.7%.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of multilingual named entity recognition (NER), the first paper presents a framework capable of identifying and linking named mentions across 282 Wikipedia languages, achieving promising results on both Wikipedia and on-Wikipedia data (1). The second paper, WiNER, introduces a methodology to create a large, high-quality corpus of named entity annotations from English Wikipedia, demonstrating substantial improvements in NER performance when using a combination of LSTM-CRF and previous state-of-the-art approaches (2). The third paper, WikiNEuRal, addresses data scarcity in NER by combining neural models with knowledge-based methods to generate silver data for multiple languages, leading to significant improvements in NER performance across various domains (3). The fourth paper leverages the structure of Wikipedia to automatically create multilingual silver-standard training annotations for NER, achieving over 95% accuracy in cross-lingual classification and outperforming existing approaches to automatic NE annotation (4). Lastly, the fifth paper evaluates the effectiveness of Wikipedia as a source for NER training data, demonstrating that an automatic annotation of Wikipedia has high agreement with gold-standard corpora and can improve model performance when used in place of newswire training data (5). Together, these studies advance the field of multilingual NER by exploring innovative data creation methods, corpus annotation, and performance evaluations on diverse text types and languages.\n\n",

Deep transfer learning for COVID\u201019 fake news detection in Persian\nThe spread of fake news on social media has increased dramatically in recent years. Hence, fake news detection systems have received researchers' attention globally. During the COVID\u201019 outbreak in 2019 and the worldwide epidemic, the importance of this issue becomes more apparent. Due to the importance of the issue, a large number of researchers have begun to collect English datasets and to study COVID\u201019 fake news detection. However, there are a large number of low\u2010resource languages, including Persian, that cannot develop accurate tools for automatic COVID\u201019 fake news detection due to the lack of annotated data for the task. In this article, we aim to develop a corpus for Persian in the domain of COVID\u201019 where the fake news is annotated and to provide a model for detecting Persian COVID\u201019 fake news. With the impressive advancement of multilingual pre\u2010trained language models, the idea of cross\u2010lingual transfer learning can be proposed to improve the generalization of models trained with low\u2010resource language datasets. Accordingly, we use the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art deep cross\u2010lingual contextualized language model, XLM\u2010RoBERTa, and the parallel convolutional neural networks to detect Persian COVID\u201019 fake news. Moreover, we use the idea of knowledge transferring across\u2010domains to improve the results by using both the English COVID\u201019 dataset and the general domain Persian fake news dataset. The combination of both cross\u2010lingual and cross\u2010domain transfer learning has outperformed the models and it has beaten the baseline by 2.39% significantly.\n\n2. COVID-19 Fake News Detection System\nThis article deals with the problem of the rapidly increasing COVID-19 infodemic in the world. Thus, there is a need for an effective framework of detecting fake information or misleading news related to COVID-19 virus/disease. To resolve this, we have used a dataset obtained from ConstraintAI'21. The dataset consists of 10,700 tweets and online posts of fake and real news concerning COVID-19. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms compared in this paper to classify the given news or tweet into real or fake are Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm. Two feature extraction techniques were used count vectorization and TF-IDF. Deep Learning (DL) algorithms implemented using Adam optimizer are Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The best testing accuracy was achieved with the LSVM model using TF-IDF feature extraction method followed by Stochastic Gradient Descent classifier with TF-IDF feature extraction technique. LR, DT, and RFC performed better with the Count vectorization feature extraction technique, whereas LSVM, KNN, NB and SGD had better accuracy with TF-IDF feature extraction technique. The LSTM model performed slightly better among the DL algorithms.\n\n3. Comparing Traditional Machine Learning Methods for COVID-19 Fake News\nThis article describes some supervised classification techniques for COVID-19 fake news detection in English, where the sources of data are annotated posts from various social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram. The main objective is to examine the performance of traditional machine learning techniques of COVID-19 fake news detection. In this Situation, models trained with Support Vector Machine and Na\u00efve Bayes algorithms outperformed all other strategies.\n\n4. Transfer learning and GRU-CRF augmentation for Covid-19 fake news detection\nThe spread of fake news on online media is very dangerous and can lead to casualties, effects on psychology, character assassination, elections for political parties, and state chaos. Fake news that concerning Covid-19 massively spread during the pandemic. Detecting misinformation on the Internet is an essential and challenging task since humans face difficulty detecting fake news. We applied BERT and GPT2 as pre-trained using the BiGRU-Att-CapsuleNet model and BiGRU-CRF features augmentation to solve Fake News detection in Constraint @ AAAI2021 - COVID19 Fake News Detection in English Dataset. This research proved that our hybrid model with augmentation got better accuracy compared to our baseline model. It also showed that BERT gave a better result than GPT2 in all models; the highest accuracy we achieved for BERT is 0.9196, and GPT2 is 0.8986.\n\n5. Selective Feature Sets Based Fake News Detection for COVID-19 to Manage Infodemic\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the spread of fake news became easy due to the wide use of social media platforms. Considering the problematic consequences of fake news, efforts have been made for the timely detection of fake news using machine learning and deep learning models. Such works focus on model optimization and feature engineering and the extraction part is under-explored area. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to investigate the impact of features to obtain high performance. For this purpose, this study analyzes the impact of different subset feature selection techniques on the performance of models for fake news detection. Principal component analysis and Chi-square are investigated for feature selection using machine learning and pre-trained deep learning models. Additionally, the influence of different preprocessing steps is also analyzed regarding fake news detection. Results obtained from comprehensive experiments reveal that the extra tree classifier outperforms with a 0.9474 accuracy when trained on the combination of term frequency-inverse document frequency and bag of words features. Models tend to yield poor results if no preprocessing or partial processing is carried out. Convolutional neural network, long short term memory network, residual neural network (ResNet), and InceptionV3 show marginally lower performance than the extra tree classifier. Results reveal that using subset features also helps to achieve robustness for machine learning models.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In addressing the challenge of COVID-19 fake news detection, recent methodologies have leveraged the power of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, with a particular focus on transfer learning and feature selection. Deep transfer learning has been employed using the Deep Cross-Linguistic Contextualized Language Model (XLM-RoBERTa) with parallel convolutional neural networks, demonstrating the effectiveness of cross-lingual and cross-domain transfer learning in enhancing detection in low-resource languages like Persian (1). Similarly, machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Decision Tree (DT), and Naive Bayes (NB) have been tested, with the LSVM model showing the highest accuracy in classifying fake news (2). Traditional machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes have also been compared, with SVM outperforming others when combined with Count vectorization, while Naive Bayes achieved better accuracy with TF-IDF feature extraction (3). Transfer learning has been further enhanced by augmenting it with GRU-CRF features, showing improved accuracy in detecting fake news (4). Lastly, the importance of feature selection has been emphasized, with the extra tree classifier showing exceptional performance using a combination of term frequency-inverse document frequency and bag of words features, indicating that subtle variations in feature subsets can significantly influence detection models' efficacy (5). These methodologies collectively underscore the critical role of transfer learning, feature selection, and the optimized application of ML and DL models in the ongoing efforts to combat the spread of fake news during the COVID-19 crisis.",

Deep transfer learning for COVID\u201019 fake news detection in Persian\nThe spread of fake news on social media has increased dramatically in recent years. Hence, fake news detection systems have received researchers' attention globally. During the COVID\u201019 outbreak in 2019 and the worldwide epidemic, the importance of this issue becomes more apparent. Due to the importance of the issue, a large number of researchers have begun to collect English datasets and to study COVID\u201019 fake news detection. However, there are a large number of low\u2010resource languages, including Persian, that cannot develop accurate tools for automatic COVID\u201019 fake news detection due to the lack of annotated data for the task. In this article, we aim to develop a corpus for Persian in the domain of COVID\u201019 where the fake news is annotated and to provide a model for detecting Persian COVID\u201019 fake news. With the impressive advancement of multilingual pre\u2010trained language models, the idea of cross\u2010lingual transfer learning can be proposed to improve the generalization of models trained with low\u2010resource language datasets. Accordingly, we use the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art deep cross\u2010lingual contextualized language model, XLM\u2010RoBERTa, and the parallel convolutional neural networks to detect Persian COVID\u201019 fake news. Moreover, we use the idea of knowledge transferring across\u2010domains to improve the results by using both the English COVID\u201019 dataset and the general domain Persian fake news dataset. The combination of both cross\u2010lingual and cross\u2010domain transfer learning has outperformed the models and it has beaten the baseline by 2.39% significantly.\n\n2. COVID-19 Fake News Detection System\nThis article deals with the problem of the rapidly increasing COVID-19 infodemic in the world. Thus, there is a need for an effective framework of detecting fake information or misleading news related to COVID-19 virus/disease. To resolve this, we have used a dataset obtained from ConstraintAI'21. The dataset consists of 10,700 tweets and online posts of fake and real news concerning COVID-19. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms compared in this paper to classify the given news or tweet into real or fake are Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm. Two feature extraction techniques were used count vectorization and TF-IDF. Deep Learning (DL) algorithms implemented using Adam optimizer are Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The best testing accuracy was achieved with the LSVM model using TF-IDF feature extraction method followed by Stochastic Gradient Descent classifier with TF-IDF feature extraction technique. LR, DT, and RFC performed better with the Count vectorization feature extraction technique, whereas LSVM, KNN, NB and SGD had better accuracy with TF-IDF feature extraction technique. The LSTM model performed slightly better among the DL algorithms.\n\n3. Comparing Traditional Machine Learning Methods for COVID-19 Fake News\nThis article describes some supervised classification techniques for COVID-19 fake news detection in English, where the sources of data are annotated posts from various social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram. The main objective is to examine the performance of traditional machine learning techniques of COVID-19 fake news detection. In this Situation, models trained with Support Vector Machine and Na\u00efve Bayes algorithms outperformed all other strategies.\n\n4. Transfer learning and GRU-CRF augmentation for Covid-19 fake news detection\nThe spread of fake news on online media is very dangerous and can lead to casualties, effects on psychology, character assassination, elections for political parties, and state chaos. Fake news that concerning Covid-19 massively spread during the pandemic. Detecting misinformation on the Internet is an essential and challenging task since humans face difficulty detecting fake news. We applied BERT and GPT2 as pre-trained using the BiGRU-Att-CapsuleNet model and BiGRU-CRF features augmentation to solve Fake News detection in Constraint @ AAAI2021 - COVID19 Fake News Detection in English Dataset. This research proved that our hybrid model with augmentation got better accuracy compared to our baseline model. It also showed that BERT gave a better result than GPT2 in all models; the highest accuracy we achieved for BERT is 0.9196, and GPT2 is 0.8986.\n\n5. Selective Feature Sets Based Fake News Detection for COVID-19 to Manage Infodemic\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the spread of fake news became easy due to the wide use of social media platforms. Considering the problematic consequences of fake news, efforts have been made for the timely detection of fake news using machine learning and deep learning models. Such works focus on model optimization and feature engineering and the extraction part is under-explored area. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to investigate the impact of features to obtain high performance. For this purpose, this study analyzes the impact of different subset feature selection techniques on the performance of models for fake news detection. Principal component analysis and Chi-square are investigated for feature selection using machine learning and pre-trained deep learning models. Additionally, the influence of different preprocessing steps is also analyzed regarding fake news detection. Results obtained from comprehensive experiments reveal that the extra tree classifier outperforms with a 0.9474 accuracy when trained on the combination of term frequency-inverse document frequency and bag of words features. Models tend to yield poor results if no preprocessing or partial processing is carried out. Convolutional neural network, long short term memory network, residual neural network (ResNet), and InceptionV3 show marginally lower performance than the extra tree classifier. Results reveal that using subset features also helps to achieve robustness for machine learning models.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The burgeoning problem of COVID-19 fake news has prompted extensive research into developing accurate detection systems. The scarcity of annotated data in low-resource languages, such as Persian (1), poses a significant challenge to the field, emphasizing the need for cross-lingual transfer learning and knowledge transfer across domains to improve performance. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Random Forests, Decision Trees, Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, and Gated Recurrent Units, have been employed, with Traditional Machine Learning techniques showing notable effectiveness (2, 3). The integration of pre-trained models like BERT and GPT2 with hybrid architectures has also shown promise, with the BiGRU-Att-CapsuleNet model and BiGRU-CRF features augmentation demonstrating improved accuracy (4). Furthermore, the selection of appropriate feature sets is crucial, with the Extra Tree Classifier outperforming other models by leveraging Principal Component Analysis and Chi-square for feature selection (5). These studies collectively underscore the importance of advanced machine learning strategies and feature subset selection in enhancing the detection and mitigation of COVID-19 fake news.",

FLOWGUARD: building robust firewalls for software-defined networks\nSoftware-Defined Networking (SDN) introduces significant granularity, visibility and flexibility to networking, but at the same time brings forth new security challenges. One of the fundamental challenges is to build robust firewalls for protecting OpenFlow-based networks where network states and traffic are frequently changed. To address this challenge, we introduce FlowGuard, a comprehensive framework, to facilitate not only accurate detection but also effective resolution of firewall policy violations in dynamic OpenFlow-based networks. FlowGuard checks network flow path spaces to detect firewall policy violations when network states are updated. In addition, FlowGuard conducts automatic and real-time violation resolutions with the help of several innovative resolution strategies designed for diverse network update situations. We also implement our framework and demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed detection and resolution approaches in FlowGuard through experiments with a real-world network topology.\n\n2. FlowRanger: A request prioritizing algorithm for controller DoS attacks in Software Defined Networks\nSoftware Defined Networking (SDN) introduces a new communication network management paradigm and has gained much attention from academia and industry. However, the centralized nature of SDN is a potential vulnerability to the system since attackers may launch denial of services (DoS) attacks against the controller. Existing solutions limit requests rate to the controller by dropping overflowed requests, but they also drop legitimate requests to the controller. To address this problem, we propose FlowRanger, a buffer prioritizing solution for controllers to handle routing requests based on their likelihood to be attacking requests, which derives the trust values of the requesting sources. Based on their trust values, FlowRanger classifies routing requests into multiple buffer queues with different priorities. Thus, attacking requests are served with a lower priority than regular requests. Our simulation results demonstrates that FlowRanger can significantly enhance the request serving rate of regular users under DoS attacks against the controller. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first solution to battle against controller DoS attacks on the controller side.\n\n3. Lightweight DDoS flooding attack detection using NOX/OpenFlow\nDistributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks became one of the main Internet security problems over the last decade, threatening public web servers in particular. Although the DDoS mechanism is widely understood, its detection is a very hard task because of the similarities between normal traffic and useless packets, sent by compromised hosts to their victims. This work presents a lightweight method for DDoS attack detection based on traffic flow features, in which the extraction of such information is made with a very low overhead compared to traditional approaches. This is possible due to the use of the NOX platform which provides a programmatic interface to facilitate the handling of switch information. Other major contributions include the high rate of detection and very low rate of false alarms obtained by flow analysis using Self Organizing Maps.\n\n4. A comprehensive security architecture for SDN\nSDN enables the administrators to configure network resources very quickly and to adjust network-wide traffic flow to meet changing needs dynamically. However, there are some challenges for implementing a full-scale carrier SDN. One of the most important challenges is SDN security, which is beginning to receive attention. With new SDN architecture, some security threats are common to traditional networking, but the profile of these threats (including their likelihood and impact and hence their overall risk level) changes. Moreover, there are some new security challenges such as bypassing predefined mandatory policies by overwriting flow entries and data eavesdropping by inserting fraudulent flow entries. This paper is to design open-flow specific security solutions and propose a comprehensive security architecture to provide security services such as enforcing mandatory network policy correctly and receiving network policy securely for SDN in order to solve these common security issues and new security challenges. It can also help the developers to implement security functions to provide security services when developing the SDN controller.\n\n5. A secure northbound interface for SDN applications\nSoftware-Defined Networking (SDN) promises to introduce flexibility and programmability into networks by offering a northbound interface (NBI) for developers to create SDN applications. However, current designs and implementations have several drawbacks, including the lack of extended security features. In this paper, we present a secure northbound interface, through which an SDN controller can offer network resources, such as statistics, flow information or topology data, via a REST-like API to registered SDN applications.

FLOWGUARD: building robust firewalls for software-defined networks\nSoftware-Defined Networking (SDN) introduces significant granularity, visibility and flexibility to networking, but at the same time brings forth new security challenges. One of the fundamental challenges is to build robust firewalls for protecting OpenFlow-based networks where network states and traffic are frequently changed. To address this challenge, we introduce FlowGuard, a comprehensive framework, to facilitate not only accurate detection but also effective resolution of firewall policy violations in dynamic OpenFlow-based networks. FlowGuard checks network flow path spaces to detect firewall policy violations when network states are updated. In addition, FlowGuard conducts automatic and real-time violation resolutions with the help of several innovative resolution strategies designed for diverse network update situations. We also implement our framework and demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed detection and resolution approaches in FlowGuard through experiments with a real-world network topology.\n\n2. FlowRanger: A request prioritizing algorithm for controller DoS attacks in Software Defined Networks\nSoftware Defined Networking (SDN) introduces a new communication network management paradigm and has gained much attention from academia and industry. However, the centralized nature of SDN is a potential vulnerability to the system since attackers may launch denial of services (DoS) attacks against the controller. Existing solutions limit requests rate to the controller by dropping overflowed requests, but they also drop legitimate requests to the controller. To address this problem, we propose FlowRanger, a buffer prioritizing solution for controllers to handle routing requests based on their likelihood to be attacking requests, which derives the trust values of the requesting sources. Based on their trust values, FlowRanger classifies routing requests into multiple buffer queues with different priorities. Thus, attacking requests are served with a lower priority than regular requests. Our simulation results demonstrates that FlowRanger can significantly enhance the request serving rate of regular users under DoS attacks against the controller. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first solution to battle against controller DoS attacks on the controller side.\n\n3. Lightweight DDoS flooding attack detection using NOX/OpenFlow\nDistributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks became one of the main Internet security problems over the last decade, threatening public web servers in particular. Although the DDoS mechanism is widely understood, its detection is a very hard task because of the similarities between normal traffic and useless packets, sent by compromised hosts to their victims. This work presents a lightweight method for DDoS attack detection based on traffic flow features, in which the extraction of such information is made with a very low overhead compared to traditional approaches. This is possible due to the use of the NOX platform which provides a programmatic interface to facilitate the handling of switch information. Other major contributions include the high rate of detection and very low rate of false alarms obtained by flow analysis using Self Organizing Maps.\n\n4. A comprehensive security architecture for SDN\nSDN enables the administrators to configure network resources very quickly and to adjust network-wide traffic flow to meet changing needs dynamically. However, there are some challenges for implementing a full-scale carrier SDN. One of the most important challenges is SDN security, which is beginning to receive attention. With new SDN architecture, some security threats are common to traditional networking, but the profile of these threats (including their likelihood and impact and hence their overall risk level) changes. Moreover, there are some new security challenges such as bypassing predefined mandatory policies by overwriting flow entries and data eavesdropping by inserting fraudulent flow entries. This paper is to design open-flow specific security solutions and propose a comprehensive security architecture to provide security services such as enforcing mandatory network policy correctly and receiving network policy securely for SDN in order to solve these common security issues and new security challenges. It can also help the developers to implement security functions to provide security services when developing the SDN controller.\n\n5. A secure northbound interface for SDN applications\nSoftware-Defined Networking (SDN) promises to introduce flexibility and programmability into networks by offering a northbound interface (NBI) for developers to create SDN applications. However, current designs and implementations have several drawbacks, including the lack of extended security features. In this paper, we present a secure northbound interface, through which an SDN controller can offer network resources, such as statistics, flow information or topology data, via a REST-like API to registered SDN applications. A trust manager ensures that only authenticated and trusted applications can utilize the interface. Furthermore, a permission system allows for fine-grained authorization and access control to the aforementioned resources. We present a prototypical implementation of our interface and developed example applications using our interface, including an SDN management dashboard.\n\n###\n\n",

The community could greatly benefit from an automatic system able to summarize scientific results, e.g., in the form of a leaderboard. In this paper we build two datasets and develop a framework (TDMS-IE) aimed at automatically extracting task, dataset, metric and score from NLP papers, towards the automatic construction of leaderboards. Experiments show that our model outperforms several baselines by a large margin. Our model is a first step towards automatic leaderboard construction, e.g., in the NLP domain.\n\n2. The STEM-ECR Dataset: Grounding Scientific Entity References in STEM Scholarly Content to Authoritative Encyclopedic and Lexicographic Sources\nWe introduce the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Medicine) Dataset for Scientific Entity Extraction, Classification, and Resolution, version 1.0 (STEM-ECR v1.0). The STEM-ECR v1.0 dataset has been developed to provide a benchmark for the evaluation of scientific entity extraction, classification, and resolution tasks in a domain-independent fashion. It comprises abstracts in 10 STEM disciplines that were found to be the most prolific ones on a major publishing platform. We describe the creation of such a multidisciplinary corpus and highlight the obtained findings in terms of the following features: 1) a generic conceptual formalism for scientific entities in a multidisciplinary scientific context; 2) the feasibility of the domain-independent human annotation of scientific entities under such a generic formalism; 3) a performance benchmark obtainable for automatic extraction of multidisciplinary scientific entities using BERT-based neural models; 4) a delineated 3-step entity resolution procedure for human annotation of the scientific entities via encyclopedic entity linking and lexicographic word sense disambiguation; and 5) human evaluations of Babelfy returned encyclopedic links and lexicographic senses for our entities. Our findings cumulatively indicate that human annotation and automatic learning of multidisciplinary scientific concepts as well as their semantic disambiguation in a wide-ranging setting as STEM is reasonable.\n\n3. Analyzing the Dynamics of Research by Extracting Key Aspects of Scientific Papers\nWe present a method for characterizing a research work in terms of its focus, domain of application, and techniques used. We show how tracing these aspects over time provides a novel measure of the influence of research communities on each other. We extract these characteristics by matching semantic extraction patterns, learned using bootstrapping, to the dependency trees of sentences in an article\u2019s\n\n4. SemEval 2017 Task 10: ScienceIE - Extracting Keyphrases and Relations from Scientific Publications\nWe describe the SemEval task of extracting keyphrases and relations between them from scientific documents, which is crucial for understanding which publications describe which processes, tasks and materials. Although this was a new task, we had a total of 26 submissions across 3 evaluation scenarios. We expect the task and the findings reported in this paper to be relevant for researchers working on understanding scientific content, as well as the broader knowledge base population and information extraction communities.\n\n5. SemEval-2018 Task 7: Semantic Relation Extraction and Classification in Scientific Papers\nThis paper describes the first task on semantic relation extraction and classification in scientific paper abstracts at SemEval 2018. The challenge focuses on domain-specific semantic relations and includes three different subtasks. The subtasks were designed so as to compare and quantify the effect of different pre-processing steps on the relation classification results. We expect the task to be relevant for a broad range of researchers working on extracting specialized knowledge from domain corpora, for example but not limited to scientific or bio-medical information extraction. The task attracted a total of 32 participants, with 158 submissions across different scenarios.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In addressing the research problem of information extraction, particularly in the context of scientific papers, recent methodologies have demonstrated diverse approaches to structuring and summarizing scholarly content. The TDMS-IE framework developed in (1) automates the extraction of tasks, datasets, metrics, and scores from NLP papers, significantly outperforming baselines in constructing scientific leaderboards. Similarly, the STEM-ECR dataset (2) emphasizes the importance of a domain-independent benchmark for scientific entity extraction and resolution, utilizing BERT-based neural models to evaluate the feasibility of automatic extraction in various STEM disciplines. This is complemented by a 3-step entity resolution procedure that combines encyclopedic linking and lexicographic word sense disambiguation to human annotations.\n\nIn terms of capturing the dynamics of research, (3) introduces a method that uses semantic extraction patterns and dependency trees to analyze the focus, domain, and techniques of scientific articles, generating insights into the influence of research communities over time. Meanwhile, SemEval 2017 Task 10 (4) focuses on the extraction of keyphrases and their interrelations from scientific documents, which is critical for understanding the content of scientific publications and has implications for knowledge base population and information extraction research. Lastly, SemEval-2018 Task 7 (5) tackles the challenge of semantic relation extrusion and classification in scientific paper abstracts, with subtasks designed to assess the impact of pre-processing steps on classification results, thereby catering to a broad spectrum of researchers in specialized knowledge extraction from domain corpora. Collectively, these methodologies underscore the multifaceted nature of information extraction, from automatic summarization to the grounding of scientific references and the analysis of research dynamics (1-5).\n\n",

        "inference": " The burgeoning volume of scientific literature necessitates advanced information extraction techniques to distill and organize knowledge effectively. Recent research has focused on developing frameworks and datasets to automate the extraction of structured information from unstructured scientific papers. One approach has been the construction of scientific leaderboards by automatically identifying tasks, datasets, evaluation metrics, and numeric scores from NLP papers, which has shown promising results in outperforming baselines (1). Another study introduced the STEM-ECR dataset, which benchmarks scientific entity extraction, classification, and resolution tasks across multiple scientific disciplines, emphasizing the feasibility of domain-independent human annotation and the importance of semantic disambiguation in entity resolution (2). Similarly, the analysis of key aspects of scientific papers, such as focus, domain, and techniques, has been proposed to characterize research influence and community dynamics, with the discovery of new relations and connections between scientific works (3). The ScienceIE task at SemEval 2017 tackled the extraction of keyphrases and their interrelations, highlighting the significance of understanding scientific content and the contributions of various research communities to knowledge base population and information extraction (4). Extending on this, the SemEval-2018 challenge focused on semantic relation extraction and classification in scientific paper abstracts, revealing the impact of pre-processing steps on classification results and the importance of domain-specific semantic relations in specialized knowledge extraction (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the evolving complexity of information extraction tasks, the necessity of specialized domain models, and the potential for automatic systems to revolutionize the synthesis and dissemination of scientific knowledge.\n\n",

Close congruence between Barcode Index Numbers (bins) and species boundaries in the Erebidae (Lepidoptera: Noctuoidea) of the Iberian Peninsula\nAbstract The DNA barcode reference library for Lepidoptera holds much promise as a tool for taxonomic research and for providing the reliable identifications needed for conservation assessment programs. We gathered sequences for the barcode region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene from 160 of the 176 nominal species of Erebidae moths (Insecta: Lepidoptera) known from the Iberian Peninsula. These results arise from a research project which constructing a DNA barcode library for the insect species of Spain. New records for 271 specimens (122 species) are coupled with preexisting data for 38 species from the Iberian fauna. Mean interspecific distance was 12.1%, while the mean nearest neighbour divergence was 6.4%. All 160 species possessed diagnostic barcode sequences, but one pair of congeneric taxa (Eublemma rosea and Eublemma rietzi) were assigned to the same BIN. As well, intraspecific sequence divergences higher than 1.5% were detected in four species which likely represent species complexes. This study reinforces the effectiveness of DNA barcoding as a tool for monitoring biodiversity in particular geographical areas and the strong correspondence between sequence clusters delineated by BINs and species recognized through detailed taxonomic analysis.\n\n2. Fast Census of Moth Diversity in the Neotropics: A Comparison of Field-Assigned Morphospecies and DNA Barcoding in Tiger Moths\nThe morphological species delimitations (i.e. morphospecies) have long been the best way to avoid the taxonomic impediment and compare insect taxa biodiversity in highly diverse tropical and subtropical regions. The development of DNA barcoding, however, has shown great potential to replace (or at least complement) the morphospecies approach, with the advantage of relying on automated methods implemented in computer programs or even online rather than in often subjective morphological features. We sampled moths extensively for two years using light traps in a patch of the highly endangered Atlantic Forest of Brazil to produce a nearly complete census of arctiines (Noctuoidea: Erebidae), whose species richness was compared using different morphological and molecular approaches (DNA barcoding). A total of 1,075 barcode sequences of 286 morphospecies were analyzed. Based on the clustering method Barcode Index Number (BIN) we found a taxonomic bias of approximately 30% in our initial morphological assessment. However, a morphological reassessment revealed that the correspondence between morphospecies and molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) can be up to 94% if differences in genitalia morphology are evaluated in individuals of different MOTUs originated from the same morphospecies (putative cases of cryptic species), and by recording if individuals of different genders in different morphospecies merge together in the same MOTU (putative cases of sexual dimorphism). The results of two other clustering methods (i.e. Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery and 2% threshold) were very similar to those of the BIN approach. Using empirical data we have shown that DNA barcoding performed substantially better than the morphospecies approach, based on superficial morphology, to delimit species of a highly diverse moth taxon, and thus should be used in species inventories.\n\n3. A DNA barcode library for the butterflies of North America\nAlthough the butterflies of North America have received considerable taxonomic attention, overlooked species and instances of hybridization continue to be revealed. The present study assembles a DNA barcode reference library for this fauna to identify groups whose patterns of sequence variation suggest the need for further taxonomic study. Based on 14,626 records from 814 species, DNA barcodes were obtained for 96% of the fauna. The maximum intraspecific distance averaged 1/4 the minimum distance to the nearest neighbor, producing a barcode gap in 76% of the species. Most species (80%) were monophyletic, the others were para- or polyphyletic. Although 15% of currently recognized species shared barcodes, the incidence of such taxa was far higher in regions exposed to Pleistocene glaciations than in those that were ice-free. Nearly 10% of species displayed high intraspecific variation (>2.5%), suggesting the need for further investigation to assess potential cryptic diversity. Aside from aiding the identification of all life stages of North American butterflies, the reference library has provided new perspectives on the incidence of both cryptic and potentially over-split species, setting the stage for future studies that can further explore the evolutionary dynamics of this group.\n\n4. A DNA barcode reference library for Swiss butterflies and forester moths as a tool for species identification, systematics and conservation\nButterfly monitoring and Red List programs in Switzerland rely on a combination of observations and collection records to document changes in species distributions through time. While most butterflies can be identified using morphology, some taxa remain challenging, making it difficult to accurately map their distributions and develop appropriate conservation measures. In this paper, we explore the use of the DNA barcode (a fragment of the mitochondrial gene COI) as a tool for the identification of Swiss butterflies and forester moths (Rhopalocera and Zygaenidae). We present a national DNA barcode reference library including 868 sequences representing 217 out of 224 resident species, or 96.9% of Swiss fauna. DNA barcodes were diagnostic for nearly 90% of Swiss species. The remaining 10% represent cases of para- and polyphyly likely involving introgression or incomplete lineage sorting among closely related taxa. We demonstrate that integrative taxonomic methods incorporating a combination of morphological and genetic techniques result in a rate of species identification of over 96% in females and over 98% in males, higher than either morphology or DNA barcodes alone. We explore the use of the DNA barcode for exploring boundaries among taxa, understanding the geographical distribution of cryptic diversity and evaluating the status of purportedly endemic taxa. Finally, we discuss how DNA barcodes may be used to improve field practices and ultimately enhance conservation strategies.\n\n5. DNA barcode reference library for Iberian butterflies enables a continental-scale preview of potential cryptic diversity\nAbstractHow common are cryptic species - those overlooked because of their morphological similarity? Despite its wide-ranging implications for biology and conservation, the answer remains open to debate. Butterflies constitute the best-studied invertebrates, playing a similar role as birds do in providing models for vertebrate biology. An accurate assessment of cryptic diversity in this emblematic group requires meticulous case-by-case assessments, but a preview to highlight cases of particular interest will help to direct future studies. We present a survey of mitochondrial genetic diversity for the butterfly fauna of the Iberian Peninsula with unprecedented resolution (3502 DNA barcodes for all 228 species), creating a reliable system for DNA-based identification and for the detection of overlooked diversity. After compiling available data for European butterflies (5782 sequences, 299 species), we applied the Generalized Mixed Yule-Coalescent model to explore potential cryptic diversity at a continental scale. The results indicate that 27.7% of these species include from two to four evolutionary significant units (ESUs), suggesting that cryptic biodiversity may be higher than expected for one of the best-studied invertebrate groups and regions. The ESUs represent important units for conservation, models for studies of evolutionary and speciation processes and sentinels for future research to unveil hidden diversity.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The methodologies employed across studies to inventorize biodiversity using DNA-based tools reveal a consensus on the effectiveness of DNA barcoding in resolving species identifications and detecting cryptic diversity. In the Erebidae moths of the Iberian Peninsula, a comprehensive barcode library was constructed from 160 species, revealing a close congruence between barcode indices and species boundaries, with a high success rate in species identification and the discovery of species complexes (1). Similarly, in Neotropical tiger moths, DNA barcoding surpassed morphospecies approaches in delimiting species, with the use of clustering methods like Barcode Index Number (BIN) and Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery yielding high accord in species identification (2). In North American butterflies, a DNA barcode reference library assembled from a large sample size facilitated the identification of species, revealed cryptic species, and provided insights into evolutionary dynamics (3). The same approach in Swiss butterflies and forester moths demonstrated a high success rate in species identification when integrated with morphological analysis, emphasizing the complementary nature of traditional taxonomic methods with genetic tools (4). Lastly, a comprehensive DNA barcode reference library for Iberian butterflies, with resolver 3502 sequences from 228 species, enabled a continental-scale analysis using the Generalized Mixed Yule-Coalescent model, revealing significant cryptic diversity within the group (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the robustness of DNA barcoding in biodiversity inventories, offering a powerful complement to traditional taxonomic techniques and providing a foundation for conservation and evolutionary research.",

        "inference": " The burgeoning field of DNA barcoding has significantly advanced biodiversity inventories, offering a robust alternative to traditional morphological methods for species identification and discovery of cryptic diversity. Studies across various regions, including the Iberian Peninsula (1), the Neotropics (2), and North America (3), have demonstrated the near-perfect congruence between Barcode Index Numbers (BINs) and species boundaries, with DNA barcoding revealing a higher taxonomic efficiency than morphospecies approaches (2). These tools have been successfully applied to Lepidoptera, but their utility extends to other groups, as evidenced by the DNA barcode reference library for Swiss butterflies and forester moths, which facilitated species identification with high accuracy (4). Moreover, the comprehensive DNA barcode reference library for the butterflies of North America has not only confirmed the identities of species but also highlighted the need for further taxonomic study due to high intraspecific variation and potential cryptic species (3). The integration of DNA barcoding in conservation strategies is also evident, as seen in the use of DNA barcode reference libraries to inform geographical distribution patterns and the presence of cryptic diversity, which is crucial for effective conservation planning (4, 5). Collectively, these studies underscore the transformative impact of DNA barcoding in unraveling the complexities of biodiversity and in refining our understanding of species boundaries, thus with far-reaching implications for both basic science and applied conservation biology (1-5).",

All 160 species possessed diagnostic barcode sequences, but one pair of congeneric taxa (Eublemma rosea and Eublemma rietzi) were assigned to the same BIN. As well, intraspecific sequence divergences higher than 1.5% were detected in four species which likely represent species complexes. This study reinforces the effectiveness of DNA barcoding as a tool for monitoring biodiversity in particular geographical areas and the strong correspondence between sequence clusters delineated by BINs and species recognized through detailed taxonomic analysis.\n\n2. Fast Census of Moth Diversity in the Neotropics: A Comparison of Field-Assigned Morphospecies and DNA Barcoding in Tiger Moths\nThe morphological species delimitations (i.e. morphospecies) have long been the best way to avoid the taxonomic impediment and compare insect taxa biodiversity in highly diverse tropical and subtropical regions. The development of DNA barcoding, however, has shown great potential to replace (or at least complement) the morphospecies approach, with the advantage of relying on automated methods implemented in computer programs or even online rather than in often subjective morphological features. We sampled moths extensively for two years using light traps in a patch of the highly endangered Atlantic Forest of Brazil to produce a nearly complete census of arctiines (Noctuoidea: Erebidae), whose species richness was compared using different morphological and molecular approaches (DNA barcoding). A total of 1,075 barcode sequences of 286 morphospecies were analyzed. Based on the clustering method Barcode Index Number (BIN) we found a taxonomic bias of approximately 30% in our initial morphological assessment. However, a morphological reassessment revealed that the correspondence between morphospecies and molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) can be up to 94% if differences in genitalia morphology are evaluated in individuals of different MOTUs originated from the same morphospecies (putative cases of cryptic species), and by recording if individuals of different genders in different morphospecies merge together in the same MOTU (putative cases of sexual dimorphism). The results of two other clustering methods (i.e. Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery and 2% threshold) were very similar to those of the BIN approach. Using empirical data we have shown that DNA barcoding performed substantially better than the morphospecies approach, based on superficial morphology, to delimit species of a highly diverse moth taxon, and thus should be used in species inventories.\n\n3. A DNA barcode library for the butterflies of North America\nAlthough the butterflies of North America have received considerable taxonomic attention, overlooked species and instances of hybridization continue to be revealed. The present study assembles a DNA barcode reference library for this fauna to identify groups whose patterns of sequence variation suggest the need for further taxonomic study. Based on 14,626 records from 814 species, DNA barcodes were obtained for 96% of the fauna. The maximum intraspecific distance averaged 1/4 the minimum distance to the nearest neighbor, producing a barcode gap in 76% of the species. Most species (80%) were monophyletic, the others were para- or polyphyletic. Although 15% of currently recognized species shared barcodes, the incidence of such taxa was far higher in regions exposed to Pleistocene glaciations than in those that were ice-free. Nearly 10% of species displayed high intraspecific variation (>2.5%), suggesting the need for further investigation to assess potential cryptic diversity. Aside from aiding the identification of all life stages of North American butterflies, the reference library has provided new perspectives on the incidence of both cryptic and potentially over-split species, setting the stage for future studies that can further explore the evolutionary dynamics of this group.\n\n4. A DNA barcode reference library for Swiss butterflies and forester moths as a tool for species identification, systematics and conservation\nButterfly monitoring and Red List programs in Switzerland rely on a combination of observations and collection records to document changes in species distributions through time. While most butterflies can be identified using morphology, some taxa remain challenging, making it difficult to accurately map their distributions and develop appropriate conservation measures. In this paper, we explore the use of the DNA barcode (a fragment of the mitochondrial gene COI) as a tool for the identification of Swiss butterflies and forester moths (Rhopalocera and Zygaenidae). We present a national DNA barcode reference library including 868 sequences representing 217 out of 224 resident species, or 96.9% of Swiss fauna. DNA barcodes were diagnostic for nearly 90% of Swiss species. The remaining 10% represent cases of para- and polyphyly likely involving introgression or incomplete lineage sorting among closely related taxa. We demonstrate that integrative taxonomic methods incorporating a combination of morphological and genetic techniques result in a rate of species identification of over 96% in females and over 98% in males, higher than either morphology or DNA barcodes alone. We explore the use of the DNA barcode for exploring boundaries among taxa, understanding the geographical distribution of cryptic diversity and evaluating the status of purportedly endemic taxa. Finally, we discuss how DNA barcodes may be used to improve field practices and ultimately enhance conservation strategies.\n\n5. DNA barcode reference library for Iberian butterflies enables a continental-scale preview of potential cryptic diversity\nAbstractHow common are cryptic species - those overlooked because of their morphological similarity? Despite its wide-ranging implications for biology and conservation, the answer remains open to debate. Butterflies constitute the best-studied invertebrates, playing a similar role as birds do in providing models for vertebrate biology. An accurate assessment of cryptic diversity in this emblematic group requires meticulous case-by-case assessments, but a preview to highlight cases of particular interest will help to direct future studies. We present a survey of mitochondrial genetic diversity for the butterfly fauna of the Iberian Peninsula with unprecedented resolution (3502 DNA barcodes for all 228 species), creating a reliable system for DNA-based identification and for the detection of overlooked diversity. After compiling available data for European butterflies (5782 sequences, 299 species), we applied the Generalized Mixed Yule-Coalescent model to explore potential cryptic diversity at a continental scale. The results indicate that 27.7% of these species include from two to four evolutionary significant units (ESUs), suggesting that cryptic biodiversity may be higher than expected for one of the best-studied invertebrate groups and regions. The ESUs represent important units for conservation, models for studies of evolutionary and speciation processes and sentinels for future research to unveil hidden diversity.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In a study of Erebidae moths on the Iberian Peninsula, DNA barcoding using the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene demonstrated a close congruence with species boundaries, with 96% of species possessing distinct barcode sequences, and a mean interspecific distance of 12.1%, suggesting that DNA barcoding is an effective tool for biodiversity inventories and conservations (1). Similarly, a comparison of morphospecies and DNA barcoding in tiger moths of the Neotropics revealed that DNA barcoding outperformed morphological approaches in delimitating species, with a 94% correspondence when genitalia morphology was considered, highlighting the potential of DNA barcoding in species inventories and the importance of integrating morphological traits in analysis (2). A DNA barcode library for the butterflies of North America identified gaps in species recognition, with 10% of species exhibiting high intraspecific variation and suggesting the need for further taxonomic study, while also confirming the monophyly of most species and the geographical patterns of cryptic diversity (3). In Switzerland, a DNA barcode reference library for butterflies and forester moths demonstrated a high species identification success rate when integrated with morphological analysis, emphasizing the complementary nature of DNA barcoding and morphology in species identification and conservation (4). Lastly, a comprehensive DNA barcode reference library for Iberian butterflies revealed that 27.7% of species may contain cryptic diversity, indicating the potential for DNA barcoding to uncover hidden biodiversity and guide conservation efforts (5). Collectively, these studies affirm the robustness of DNA-based tools in cataloging biodiversity and the necessity of integrating traditional taxonomic methods in modern biodiversity research.",

DNA barcodes distinguish species of tropical Lepidoptera\nAlthough central to much biological research, the identification of species is often difficult. The use of DNA barcodes, short DNA sequences from a standardized region of the genome, has recently been proposed as a tool to facilitate species identification and discovery. However, the effectiveness of DNA barcoding for identifying specimens in species-rich tropical biotas is unknown. Here we show that cytochrome             c             oxidase I DNA barcodes effectively discriminate among species in three Lepidoptera families from Area de Conservaci\u00f3n Guanacaste in northwestern Costa Rica. We found that 97.9% of the 521 species recognized by prior taxonomic work possess distinctive cytochrome             c             oxidase I barcodes and that the few instances of interspecific sequence overlap involve very similar species. We also found two or more barcode clusters within each of 13 supposedly single species. Covariation between these clusters and morphological and/or ecological traits indicates overlooked species complexes. If these results are general, DNA barcoding will significantly aid species identification and discovery in tropical settings.\n\n3. Characterization and comparison of poorly known moth communities through DNA barcoding in two Afrotropical environments in Gabon\nBiodiversity research in tropical ecosystems\u2014popularized as the most biodiverse habitats on Earth\u2014often neglects invertebrates, yet invertebrates represent the bulk of local species richness. Insect communities in particular remain strongly impeded by both Linnaean and Wallacean shortfalls, and identifying species often remains a formidable challenge inhibiting the use of these organisms as indicators for ecological and conservation studies. Here we use DNA barcoding as an alternative to the traditional taxonomic approach for characterizing and comparing the diversity of moth communities in two different ecosystems in Gabon. Though sampling remains very incomplete, as evidenced by the high proportion (59%) of species represented by singletons, our results reveal an outstanding diversity. With about 3500 specimens sequenced and representing 1385 BINs (Barcode Index Numbers, used as a proxy to species) in 23 families, the diversity of moths in the two sites sampled is higher than the current number of species listed for the entire country, highlighting the huge gap in biodiversity knowledge for this country. Both seasonal and spatial turnovers are strikingly high (18.3% of BINs shared between seasons, and 13.3% between sites) and draw attention to the need to account for these when running regional surveys. Our results also highlight the richness and singularity of savannah environments and emphasize the status of Central African ecosystems as hotspots of biodiversity.\n\n4. Close congruence between Barcode Index Numbers (bins) and species boundaries in the Erebidae (Lepidoptera: Noctuoidea) of the Iberian Peninsula\nAbstract The DNA barcode reference library for Lepidoptera holds much promise as a tool for taxonomic research and for providing the reliable identifications needed for conservation assessment programs. We gathered sequences for the barcode region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene from 160 of the 176 nominal species of Erebidae moths (Insecta: Lepidoptera) known from the Iberian Peninsula. These results arise from a research project which constructing a DNA barcode library for the insect species of Spain. New records for 271 specimens (122 species) are coupled with preexisting data for 38 species from the Iberian fauna. Mean interspecific distance was 12.1%, while the mean nearest neighbour divergence was 6.4%. All 160 species possessed diagnostic barcode sequences, but one pair of congeneric taxa (Eublemma rosea and Eublemma rietzi) were assigned to the same BIN. As well, intraspecific sequence divergences higher than 1.5% were detected in four species which likely represent species complexes. This study reinforces the effectiveness of DNA barcoding as a tool for monitoring biodiversity in particular geographical areas and the strong correspondence between sequence clusters delineated by BINs and species recognized through detailed taxonomic analysis.\n\n5. DNA Barcoding the Geometrid Fauna of Bavaria (Lepidoptera): Successes, Surprises, and Questions\nBackground The State of Bavaria is involved in a research program that will lead to the construction of a DNA barcode library for all animal species within its territorial boundaries. The present study provides a comprehensive DNA barcode library for the Geometridae, one of the most diverse of insect families. Methodology/Principal Findings This study reports DNA barcodes for 400 Bavarian geometrid species, 98 per cent of the known fauna, and approximately one per cent of all Bavarian animal species. Although 98.5% of these species possess diagnostic barcode sequences in Bavaria, records from neighbouring countries suggest that species-level resolution may be compromised in up to 3.5% of cases. All taxa which apparently share barcodes are discussed in detail. One case of modest divergence (1.4%) revealed a species overlooked by the current taxonomic system: Eupithecia goossensiata Mabille, 1869 stat.n. is raised from synonymy with Eupithecia absinthiata (Clerck, 1759) to species rank. Deep intraspecific sequence divergences (>2%) were detected in 20 traditionally recognized species. Conclusions/Significance The study emphasizes the effectiveness of DNA barcoding as a tool for monitoring biodiversity. Open access is provided to a data set that includes records for 1,395 geometrid specimens (331 species) from Bavaria, with 69 additional species from neighbouring regions. Taxa with deep intraspecific sequence divergences are undergoing more detailed analysis to ascertain if they represent cases of cryptic diversity.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The methodologies employed across these studies demonstrate the efficacy of DNA barcoding in cataloging biodiversity, particularly in groups where traditional taxonomic methods have proven challenging due to the high volume of specimens and the subjectivity of morphological features. In the Neotropics, a combination of field-assigned morphospecies and DNA barcoding revealed a significant taxonomic bias in morphological assessments, with a high correspondence between morphospecies and molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) when genitalia morphology was considered, especially in putative cases of cryptic species and sexual dimorphism (1). Similarly, in Costa Rica, DNA barcoding of Lepidoptera families showed a high success rate in species discrimination, with a few instances of sequence overlap suggesting the presence of cryptic species complexes (2). In Gabon, DNA barcoding not only facilitated the characterization of poorly known moth communities but also highlighted the need for seasonal and spatial sampling to account for high seasonal and intersite divergence (3). On the Iberian Peninsula, a near-complete species coverage was achieved, with a strong congruence between Barcode Index Numbers (BINs) and species boundaries, reinforcing the reliability of DNA barcoding in monitoring geographical biodiversity (4). Lastly, in Bavaria, DNA barcoding of Geometrid fauna identified species-level resolution issues and revealed cryptic diversity, with the methodology providing a comprehensive tool for biodiversity monitoring (5).

Both seasonal and spatial turnovers are strikingly high (18.3% of BINs shared between seasons, and 13.3% between sites) and draw attention to the need to account for these when running regional surveys. Our results also highlight the richness and singularity of savannah environments and emphasize the status of Central African ecosystems as hotspots of biodiversity.\n\n4. Close congruence between Barcode Index Numbers (bins) and species boundaries in the Erebidae (Lepidoptera: Noctuoidea) of the Iberian Peninsula\nAbstract The DNA barcode reference library for Lepidoptera holds much promise as a tool for taxonomic research and for providing the reliable identifications needed for conservation assessment programs. We gathered sequences for the barcode region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene from 160 of the 176 nominal species of Erebidae moths (Insecta: Lepidoptera) known from the Iberian Peninsula. These results arise from a research project which constructing a DNA barcode library for the insect species of Spain. New records for 271 specimens (122 species) are coupled with preexisting data for 38 species from the Iberian fauna. Mean interspecific distance was 12.1%, while the mean nearest neighbour divergence was 6.4%. All 160 species possessed diagnostic barcode sequences, but one pair of congeneric taxa (Eublemma rosea and Eublemma rietzi) were assigned to the same BIN. As well, intraspecific sequence divergences higher than 1.5% were detected in four species which likely represent species complexes. This study reinforces the effectiveness of DNA barcoding as a tool for monitoring biodiversity in particular geographical areas and the strong correspondence between sequence clusters delineated by BINs and species recognized through detailed taxonomic analysis.\n\n5. DNA Barcoding the Geometrid Fauna of Bavaria (Lepidoptera): Successes, Surprises, and Questions\nBackground The State of Bavaria is involved in a research program that will lead to the construction of a DNA barcode library for all animal species within its territorial boundaries. The present study provides a comprehensive DNA barcode library for the Geometridae, one of the most diverse of insect families. Methodology/Principal Findings This study reports DNA barcodes for 400 Bavarian geometrid species, 98 per cent of the known fauna, and approximately one per cent of all Bavarian animal species. Although 98.5% of these species possess diagnostic barcode sequences in Bavaria, records from neighbouring countries suggest that species-level resolution may be compromised in up to 3.5% of cases. All taxa which apparently share barcodes are discussed in detail. One case of modest divergence (1.4%) revealed a species overlooked by the current taxonomic system: Eupithecia goossensiata Mabille, 1869 stat.n. is raised from synonymy with Eupithecia absinthiata (Clerck, 1759) to species rank. Deep intraspecific sequence divergences (>2%) were detected in 20 traditionally recognized species. Conclusions/Significance The study emphasizes the effectiveness of DNA barcoding as a tool for monitoring biodiversity. Open access is provided to a data set that includes records for 1,395 geometrid specimens (331 species) from Bavaria, with 69 additional species from neighbouring regions. Taxa with deep intraspecific sequence divergences are undergoing more detailed analysis to ascertain if they represent cases of cryptic diversity.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The burgeoning field of DNA barcoding has revolutionized biodiversity inventories, offering a robust alternative to the traditional taxonomic approaches that have long been constrained by the Linnaean and Wallacean shortfalls (3, 4). Studies across diverse ecosystems, from the Neotropics to the Afrotropics and Europe, have demonstrated the efficacy of DNA barcoding in revealing significant species richness and complexity, often exceeding the known recorded species within a region (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). For instance, in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, a comparision of field-assigned morphospecies and DNA barcoding revealed a substantial improvement in species delimitation using the molecular approach, with a 94% correspondence when genitalia morphology was considered, suggesting a higher cryptic species diversity than previously recognized (1). Similarly, in Costa Rica, DNA barcoding distinguished species of highly diverse Lepidoptera families with a 97.9% success rate, uncovering cryptic species complexes that traditional taxonomy may have overlooking (2). In Gabon, DNA barcoding of moth communities revealed an extraordinary diversity, with a substantial number of species represented by singletons, highlighting the critical need for comprehensive sampling to avoid taxonomic oversimplification (3). This phenomenon is also observed in the Iberian Peninsula, where a near-complete congruence between Barcode Index Numbers (BINs) and species boundaries is seen, reinforcing the reliability of DNA barcoding in monitoring biodiversity (4). Even in well-studied regions like Bavaria, Germany, DNA barcoding has led to the discovery of new species and detected deep intraspecific divergences, indicating the presence of cryptic diversity (5). The integration of DNA barcoding into conservation and ecological studies will undoubtedly enhance our understanding of species distributions and the ecological roles they play, enabling more effective protection and management of biodiversity (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).",

Fast Census of Moth Diversity in the Neotropics: A Comparison of Field-Assigned Morphospecies and DNA Barcoding in Tiger Moths\nThe morphological species delimitations (i.e. morphospecies) have long been the best way to avoid the taxonomic impediment and compare insect taxa biodiversity in highly diverse tropical and subtropical regions. The development of DNA barcoding, however, has shown great potential to replace (or at least complement) the morphospecies approach, with the advantage of relying on automated methods implemented in computer programs or even online rather than in often subjective morphological features. We sampled moths extensively for two years using light traps in a patch of the highly endangered Atlantic Forest of Brazil to produce a nearly complete census of arctiines (Noctuoidea: Erebidae), whose species richness was compared using different morphological and molecular approaches (DNA barcoding). A total of 1,075 barcode sequences of 286 morphospecies were analyzed. Based on the clustering method Barcode Index Number (BIN) we found a taxonomic bias of approximately 30% in our initial morphological assessment. However, a morphological reassessment revealed that the correspondence between morphospecies and molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) can be up to 94% if differences in genitalia morphology are evaluated in individuals of different MOTUs originated from the same morphospecies (putative cases of cryptic species), and by recording if individuals of different genders in different morphospecies merge together in the same MOTU (putative cases of sexual dimorphism). The results of two other clustering methods (i.e. Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery and 2% threshold) were very similar to those of the BIN approach. Using empirical data we have shown that DNA barcoding performed substantially better than the morphospecies approach, based on superficial morphology, to delimit species of a highly diverse moth taxon, and thus should be used in species inventories.\n\n2. DNA barcodes distinguish species of tropical Lepidoptera\nAlthough central to much biological research, the identification of species is often difficult. The use of DNA barcodes, short DNA sequences from a standardized region of the genome, has recently been proposed as a tool to facilitate species identification and discovery. However, the effectiveness of DNA barcoding for identifying specimens in species-rich tropical biotas is unknown. Here we show that cytochrome             c             oxidase I DNA barcodes effectively discriminate among species in three Lepidoptera families from Area de Conservaci\u00f3n Guanacaste in northwestern Costa Rica. We found that 97.9% of the 521 species recognized by prior taxonomic work possess distinctive cytochrome             c             oxidase I barcodes and that the few instances of interspecific sequence overlap involve very similar species. We also found two or more barcode clusters within each of 13 supposedly single species. Covariation between these clusters and morphological and/or ecological traits indicates overlooked species complexes. If these results are general, DNA barcoding will significantly aid species identification and discovery in tropical settings.\n\n3. Characterization and comparison of poorly known moth communities through DNA barcoding in two Afrotropical environments in Gabon\nBiodiversity research in tropical ecosystems\u2014popularized as the most biodiverse habitats on Earth\u2014often neglects invertebrates, yet invertebrates represent the bulk of local species richness. Insect communities in particular remain strongly impeded by both Linnaean and Wallacean shortfalls, and identifying species often remains a formidable challenge inhibiting the use of these organisms as indicators for ecological and conservation studies. Here we use DNA barcoding as an alternative to the traditional taxonomic approach for characterizing and comparing the diversity of moth communities in two different ecosystems in Gabon. Though sampling remains very incomplete, as evidenced by the high proportion (59%) of species represented by singletons, our results reveal an outstanding diversity. With about 3500 specimens sequenced and representing 1385 BINs (Barcode Index Numbers, used as a proxy to species) in 23 families, the diversity of moths in the two sites sampled is higher than the current number of species listed for the entire country, highlighting the huge gap in biodiversity knowledge for this country.

Probing planetary biodiversity with DNA barcodes: The Noctuoidea of North America\nThis study reports the assembly of a DNA barcode reference library for species in the lepidopteran superfamily Noctuoidea from Canada and the USA. Based on the analysis of 69,378 specimens, the library provides coverage for 97.3% of the noctuoid fauna (3565 of 3664 species). In addition to verifying the strong performance of DNA barcodes in the discrimination of these species, the results indicate close congruence between the number of species analyzed (3565) and the number of sequence clusters (3816) recognized by the Barcode Index Number (BIN) system. Distributional patterns across 12 North American ecoregions are examined for the 3251 species that have GPS data while BIN analysis is used to quantify overlap between the noctuoid faunas of North America and other zoogeographic regions. This analysis reveals that 90% of North American noctuoids are endemic and that just 7.5% and 1.8% of BINs are shared with the Neotropics and with the Palearctic, respectively. One third (29) of the latter species are recent introductions and, as expected, they possess low intraspecific divergences.\n\n2. A DNA barcode reference library for Swiss butterflies and forester moths as a tool for species identification, systematics and conservation\nButterfly monitoring and Red List programs in Switzerland rely on a combination of observations and collection records to document changes in species distributions through time. While most butterflies can be identified using morphology, some taxa remain challenging, making it difficult to accurately map their distributions and develop appropriate conservation measures. In this paper, we explore the use of the DNA barcode (a fragment of the mitochondrial gene COI) as a tool for the identification of Swiss butterflies and forester moths (Rhopalocera and Zygaenidae). We present a national DNA barcode reference library including 868 sequences representing 217 out of 224 resident species, or 96.9% of Swiss fauna. DNA barcodes were diagnostic for nearly 90% of Swiss species. The remaining 10% represent cases of para- and polyphyly likely involving introgression or incomplete lineage sorting among closely related taxa. We demonstrate that integrative taxonomic methods incorporating a combination of morphological and genetic techniques result in a rate of species identification of over 96% in females and over 98% in males, higher than either morphology or DNA barcodes alone. We explore the use of the DNA barcode for exploring boundaries among taxa, understanding the geographical distribution of cryptic diversity and evaluating the status of purportedly endemic taxa. Finally, we discuss how DNA barcodes may be used to improve field practices and ultimately enhance conservation strategies.\n\n3. DNA barcode analysis of butterfly species from Pakistan points towards regional endemism\nDNA barcodes were obtained for 81 butterfly species belonging to 52 genera from sites in north\u2010central Pakistan to test the utility of barcoding for their identification and to gain a better understanding of regional barcode variation. These species represent 25% of the butterfly fauna of Pakistan and belong to five families, although the Nymphalidae were dominant, comprising 38% of the total specimens. Barcode analysis showed that maximum conspecific divergence was 1.6%, while there was 1.7\u201314.3% divergence from the nearest neighbour species. Barcode records for 55 species showed <2% sequence divergence to records in the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD), but only 26 of these cases involved specimens from neighbouring India and Central Asia. Analysis revealed that most species showed little incremental sequence variation when specimens from other regions were considered, but a threefold increase was noted in a few cases. There was a clear gap between maximum intraspecific and minimum nearest neighbour distance for all 81 species. Neighbour\u2010joining cluster analysis showed that members of each species formed a monophyletic cluster with strong bootstrap support. The barcode results revealed two provisional species that could not be clearly linked to known taxa, while 24 other species gained their first coverage. Future work should extend the barcode reference library to include all butterfly species from Pakistan as well as neighbouring countries to gain a better understanding of regional variation in barcode sequences in this topographically and climatically complex region.\n\n4. Use of species delimitation approaches to tackle the cryptic diversity of an assemblage of high Andean butterflies (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea)\nCryptic biological diversity has generated ambiguity in taxonomic and evolutionary studies. Single-locus methods and other approaches for species delimitation are useful for addressing this challenge, enabling the practical processing of large numbers of samples for identification and inventory purposes. This study analyzed an assemblage of high Andean butterflies using DNA barcoding and compared the identifications based on the current morphological taxonomy with three methods of species delimitation (automatic barcode gap discovery, generalized mixed Yule coalescent model, and Poisson tree processes). Sixteen potential cryptic species were recognized using these three methods, representing a net richness increase of 11.3% in the assemblage. A well-studied taxon of the genus Vanessa, which has a wide geographical distribution, appeared with the potential cryptic species that had a higher genetic differentiation at the local level than at the continental level. The analyses were useful for identifying the potential cryptic species in Pedaliodes and Forsterinaria complexes, which also show differentiation along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients. This genetic assessment of an entire assemblage of high Andean butterflies (Papilionoidea) provides baseline information for future research in a region characterized by high rates of endemism and population isolation.\n\n5. Fast Census of Moth Diversity in the Neotropics: A Comparison of Field-Assigned Morphospecies and DNA Barcoding in Tiger Moths\nThe morphological species delimitations (i.e. morphospecies) have long been the best way to avoid the taxonomic impediment and compare insect taxa biodiversity in highly diverse tropical and subtropical regions. The development of DNA barcoding, however, has shown great potential to replace (or at least complement) the morphospecies approach, with the advantage of relying on automated methods implemented in computer programs or even online rather than in often subjective morphological features. We sampled moths extensively for two years using light traps in a patch of the highly endangered Atlantic Forest of Brazil to produce a nearly complete census of arctiines (Noctuoidea: Erebidae), whose species richness was compared using different morphological and molecular approaches (DNA barcoding). A total of 1,075 barcode sequences of 286 morphospecies were analyzed. Based on the clustering method Barcode Index Number (BIN) we found a taxonomic bias of approximately 30% in our initial morphological assessment. However, a morphological reassessment revealed that the correspondence between morphospecies and molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) can be up to 94% if differences in genitalia morphology are evaluated in individuals of different MOTUs originated from the same morphospecies (putative cases of cryptic species), and by recording if individuals of different genders in different morphospecies merge together in the same MOTU (putative cases of sexual dimorphism). The results of two other clustering methods (i.e. Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery and 2% threshold) were very similar to those of the BIN approach. Using empirical data we have shown that DNA barcoding performed substantially better than the morphospecies approach, based on superficial morphology, to delimit species of a highly diverse moth taxon, and thus should be used in species inventories.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The methodologies employed across five studies demonstrate the power of DNA barcoding in cataloging biodiversity, particularly in groups where traditional taxonomic methods face challenges. In the first study, a comprehensive DNA barcode reference library was established for Noctuoidea species in North America, utilizing both morphological characteristics and Barcode Index Numbers (BIN) to distinguish species and assess environmental influences on diversity (1). Similarly, in Switzerland, DNA barcoding complemented morphological analysis to achieve high species identification rates, particularly in challenging cases, and provided insights into cryptic species and regional dynamics (2). Pakistan's butterfly fauna was analyzed using DNA barcoding to reveal regional endemism and to differentiate between provisional and known species, with the technique identifying new species and confirming geographical patterns (3). In the high Andes, species delimitation methods like Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery, Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent Model, and Poisson Tree Processes were applied to assemblages of butterflies, revealing significant cryptic diversity and the importance of genetic differentiation at local scales (4). Lastly, in the Neotropics, DNA barcoding outperformed morphospecies approaches in a study of moths, with a high correspondence achieved when genitalia morphology was considered, indicating the method's sensitivity to cryptic sexual dimorphism (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the efficacy of DNA-based tools in overcoming the taxonomic challenge, enhancing species identification, and uncovering subtle genetic structures that aid in biodiversity management.\n\n",

Probing planetary biodiversity with DNA barcodes: The Noctuoidea of North America\nThis study reports the assembly of a DNA barcode reference library for species in the lepidopteran superfamily Noctuoidea from Canada and the USA. Based on the analysis of 69,378 specimens, the library provides coverage for 97.3% of the noctuoid fauna (3565 of 3664 species). In addition to verifying the strong performance of DNA barcodes in the discrimination of these species, the results indicate close congruence between the number of species analyzed (3565) and the number of sequence clusters (3816) recognized by the Barcode Index Number (BIN) system. Distributional patterns across 12 North American ecoregions are examined for the 3251 species that have GPS data while BIN analysis is used to quantify overlap between the noctuoid faunas of North America and other zoogeographic regions. This analysis reveals that 90% of North American noctuoids are endemic and that just 7.5% and 1.8% of BINs are shared with the Neotropics and with the Palearctic, respectively. One third (29) of the latter species are recent introductions and, as expected, they possess low intraspecific divergences.\n\n2. A DNA barcode reference library for Swiss butterflies and forester moths as a tool for species identification, systematics and conservation\nButterfly monitoring and Red List programs in Switzerland rely on a combination of observations and collection records to document changes in species distributions through time. While most butterflies can be identified using morphology, some taxa remain challenging, making it difficult to accurately map their distributions and develop appropriate conservation measures. In this paper, we explore the use of the DNA barcode (a fragment of the mitochondrial gene COI) as a tool for the identification of Swiss butterflies and forester moths (Rhopalocera and Zygaenidae). We present a national DNA barcode reference library including 868 sequences representing 217 out of 224 resident species, or 96.9% of Swiss fauna. DNA barcodes were diagnostic for nearly 90% of Swiss species. The remaining 10% represent cases of para- and polyphyly likely involving introgression or incomplete lineage sorting among closely related taxa. We demonstrate that integrative taxonomic methods incorporating a combination of morphological and genetic techniques result in a rate of species identification of over 96% in females and over 98% in males, higher than either morphology or DNA barcodes alone. We explore the use of the DNA barcode for exploring boundaries among taxa, understanding the geographical distribution of cryptic diversity and evaluating the status of purportedly endemic taxa. Finally, we discuss how DNA barcodes may be used to improve field practices and ultimately enhance conservation strategies.\n\n3. DNA barcode analysis of butterfly species from Pakistan points towards regional endemism\nDNA barcodes were obtained for 81 butterfly species belonging to 52 genera from sites in north\u2010central Pakistan to test the utility of barcoding for their identification and to gain a better understanding of regional barcode variation. These species represent 25% of the butterfly fauna of Pakistan and belong to five families, although the Nymphalidae were dominant, comprising 38% of the total specimens. Barcode analysis showed that maximum conspecific divergence was 1.6%, while there was 1.7\u201314.3% divergence from the nearest neighbour species. Barcode records for 55 species showed <2% sequence divergence to records in the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD), but only 26 of these cases involved specimens from neighbouring India and Central Asia. Analysis revealed that most species showed little incremental sequence variation when specimens from other regions were considered, but a threefold increase was noted in a few cases. There was a clear gap between maximum intraspecific and minimum nearest neighbour distance for all 81 species. Neighbour\u2010joining cluster analysis showed that members of each species formed a monophyletic cluster with strong bootstrap support. The barcode results revealed two provisional species that could not be clearly linked to known taxa, while 24 other species gained their first coverage. Future work should extend the barcode reference library to include all butterfly species from Pakistan as well as neighbouring countries to gain a better understanding of regional variation in barcode sequences in this topographically and climatically complex region.\n\n4. Use of species delimitation approaches to tackle the cryptic diversity of an assemblage of high Andean butterflies (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea)\nCryptic biological diversity has generated ambiguity in taxonomic and evolutionary studies. Single-locus methods and other approaches for species delimitation are useful for addressing this challenge, enabling the practical processing of large numbers of samples for identification and inventory purposes. This study analyzed an assemblage of high Andean butterflies using DNA barcoding and compared the identifications based on the current morphological taxonomy with three methods of species delimitation (automatic barcode gap discovery, generalized mixed Yule coalescent model, and Poisson tree processes). Sixteen potential cryptic species were recognized using these three methods, representing a net richness increase of 11.3% in the assemblage. A well-studied taxon of the genus Vanessa, which has a wide geographical distribution, appeared with the potential cryptic species that had a higher genetic differentiation at the local level than at the continental level. The analyses were useful for identifying the potential cryptic species in Pedaliodes and Forsterinaria complexes, which also show differentiation along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients. This genetic assessment of an entire assemblage of high Andean butterflies (Papilionoidea) provides baseline information for future research in a region characterized by high rates of endemism and population isolation.\n\n5. Fast Census of Moth Diversity in the Neotropics: A Comparison of Field-Assigned Morphospecies and DNA Barcoding in Tiger Moths\nThe morphological species delimitations (i.e. morphospecies) have long been the best way to avoid the taxonomic impediment and compare insect taxa biodiversity in highly diverse tropical and subtropical regions. The development of DNA barcoding, however, has shown great potential to replace (or at least complement) the morphospecies approach, with the advantage of relying on automated methods implemented in computer programs or even online rather than in often subjective morphological features. We sampled moths extensively for two years using light traps in a patch of the highly endangered Atlantic Forest of Brazil to produce a nearly complete census of arctiines (Noctuoidea: Erebidae), whose species richness was compared using different morphological and molecular approaches (DNA barcoding). A total of 1,075 barcode sequences of 286 morphospecies were analyzed. Based on the clustering method Barcode Index Number (BIN) we found a taxonomic bias of approximately 30% in our initial morphological assessment. However, a morphological reassessment revealed that the correspondence between morphospecies and molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) can be up to 94% if differences in genitalia morphology are evaluated in individuals of different MOTUs originated from the same morphospecies (putative cases of cryptic species), and by recording if individuals of different genders in different morphospecies merge together in the same MOTU (putative cases of sexual dimorphism).

        "inference": " The burgeoning field of DNA barcoding has revolutionized biodiversity inventories, offering a powerful tool for species identification and the revelation of cryptic diversity across various taxa. Studies have demonstrated the efficacy of DNA barcodes in accurately discriminating between closely related species, as seen in the noctuoid insects of North America, where a comprehensive reference library led to a high species identification rate and revealed a significant fraction of endemic species (1). Similarly, in Switzerland, the integration of DNA barcoding with morphological analysis has proven effective in species identification, particularly in the challenging cases of morphologically similar or distant species (2). In Pakistan, DNA barcoding has not only facilitated the identification of a significant portion of the country's butterfly fauna but has also highlighted the potential for regional endemism, with many species showing little genetic variation across regional boundaries (3). High Andean butterflies have been shown to harbor considerable cryptic diversity, which is becoming clearer through the application of species delimitation methods that complement traditional morphological taxonomy (4). And in the Neotropics, the comparison of field-assigned morphospecies with DNA barcoding in moths has revealed a substantial discrepancy, suggesting that DNA-based approaches may be significantly more effective in species inventories than the traditional morphological methods (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the transformative impact of DNA barcoding in unraveling the complexity of biodiversity and the importance of incorporating molecular tools into modern biodiversity research.",

High resolution DNA barcode library for European butterflies reveals continental patterns of mitochondrial genetic diversity\nAbstractThe study of global biodiversity will greatly benefit from access to comprehensive DNA barcode libraries at continental scale, but such datasets are still very rare. Here, we assemble the first high-resolution reference library for European butterflies that provides 97% taxon coverage (459 species) and 22,306 COI sequences. We estimate that we captured 62% of the total haplotype diversity and show that most species possess a few very common haplotypes and many rare ones. Specimens in the dataset have an average 95.3% probability of being correctly identified. Mitochondrial diversity displayed elevated haplotype richness in southern European refugia, establishing the generality of this key biogeographic pattern for an entire taxonomic group. Fifteen percent of the species are involved in barcode sharing, but two thirds of these cases may reflect the need for further taxonomic research. This dataset provides a unique resource for conservation and for studying evolutionary processes, cryptic species, phylogeography, and ecology.\n\n2. A DNA barcode reference library for Swiss butterflies and forester moths as a tool for species identification, systematics and conservation\nButterfly monitoring and Red List programs in Switzerland rely on a combination of observations and collection records to document changes in species distributions through time. While most butterflies can be identified using morphology, some taxa remain challenging, making it difficult to accurately map their distributions and develop appropriate conservation measures. In this paper, we explore the use of the DNA barcode (a fragment of the mitochondrial gene COI) as a tool for the identification of Swiss butterflies and forester moths (Rhopalocera and Zygaenidae). We present a national DNA barcode reference library including 868 sequences representing 217 out of 224 resident species, or 96.9% of Swiss fauna. DNA barcodes were diagnostic for nearly 90% of Swiss species. The remaining 10% represent cases of para- and polyphyly likely involving introgression or incomplete lineage sorting among closely related taxa. We demonstrate that integrative taxonomic methods incorporating a combination of morphological and genetic techniques result in a rate of species identification of over 96% in females and over 98% in males, higher than either morphology or DNA barcodes alone. We explore the use of the DNA barcode for exploring boundaries among taxa, understanding the geographical distribution of cryptic diversity and evaluating the status of purportedly endemic taxa. Finally, we discuss how DNA barcodes may be used to improve field practices and ultimately enhance conservation strategies.\n\n3. Species-Level Para- and Polyphyly in DNA Barcode Gene Trees: Strong Operational Bias in European Lepidoptera\nThe proliferation of DNA data is revolutionizing all fields of systematic research. DNA barcode sequences, now available for millions of specimens and several hundred thousand species, are increasingly used in algorithmic species delimitations. This is complicated by occasional incongruences between species and gene genealogies, as indicated by situations where conspecific individuals do not form a monophyletic cluster in a gene tree. In two previous reviews, non-monophyly has been reported as being common in mitochondrial DNA gene trees. We developed a novel web service \u201cMonophylizer\u201d to detect non-monophyly in phylogenetic trees and used it to ascertain the incidence of species non-monophyly in COI (a.k.a. cox1) barcode sequence data from 4977 species and 41,583 specimens of European Lepidoptera, the largest data set of DNA barcodes analyzed from this regard. Particular attention was paid to accurate species identification to ensure data integrity. We investigated the effects of tree-building method, sampling effort, and other methodological issues, all of which can influence estimates of non-monophyly. We found a 12% incidence of non-monophyly, a value significantly lower than that observed in previous studies. Neighbor joining (NJ) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods yielded almost equal numbers of non-monophyletic species, but 24.1% of these cases of non-monophyly were only found by one of these methods. Non-monophyletic species tend to show either low genetic distances to their nearest neighbors or exceptionally high levels of intraspecific variability. Cases of polyphyly in COI trees arising as a result of deep intraspecific divergence are negligible, as the detected cases reflected misidentifications or methodological errors. Taking into consideration variation in sampling effort, we estimate that the true incidence of non-monophyly is \u223c23%, but with operational factors still being included. Within the operational factors, we separately assessed the frequency of taxonomic limitations (presence of overlooked cryptic and oversplit species) and identification uncertainties. We observed that operational factors are potentially present in more than half (58.6%) of the detected cases of non-monophyly. Furthermore, we observed that in about 20% of non-monophyletic species and entangled species, the lineages involved are either allopatric or parapatric\u2014conditions where species delimitation is inherently subjective and particularly dependent on the species concept that has been adopted. These observations suggest that species-level non-monophyly in COI gene trees is less common than previously supposed, with many cases reflecting misidentifications, the subjectivity of species delimitation or other operational factors.\n\n4. Use of species delimitation approaches to tackle the cryptic diversity of an assemblage of high Andean butterflies (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea)\nCryptic biological diversity has generated ambiguity in taxonomic and evolutionary studies. Single-locus methods and other approaches for species delimitation are useful for addressing this challenge, enabling the practical processing of large numbers of samples for identification and inventory purposes. This study analyzed an assemblage of high Andean butterflies using DNA barcoding and compared the identifications based on the current morphological taxonomy with three methods of species delimitation (automatic barcode gap discovery, generalized mixed Yule coalescent model, and Poisson tree processes). Sixteen potential cryptic species were recognized using these three methods, representing a net richness increase of 11.3% in the assemblage. A well-studied taxon of the genus Vanessa, which has a wide geographical distribution, appeared with the potential cryptic species that had a higher genetic differentiation at the local level than at the continental level. The analyses were useful for identifying the potential cryptic species in Pedaliodes and Forsterinaria complexes, which also show differentiation along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients. This genetic assessment of an entire assemblage of high Andean butterflies (Papilionoidea) provides baseline information for future research in a region characterized by high rates of endemism and population isolation.\n\n5. Complete DNA barcode reference library for a country's butterfly fauna reveals high performance for temperate Europe\nDNA barcoding aims to accelerate species identification and discovery, but performance tests have shown marked differences in identification success. As a consequence, there remains a great need for comprehensive studies which objectively test the method in groups with a solid taxonomic framework. This study focuses on the 180 species of butterflies in Romania, accounting for about one third of the European butterfly fauna. This country includes five eco-regions, the highest of any in the European Union, and is a good representative for temperate areas. Morphology and DNA barcodes of more than 1300 specimens were carefully studied and compared. Our results indicate that 90 per cent of the species form barcode clusters allowing their reliable identification. The remaining cases involve nine closely related species pairs, some whose taxonomic status is controversial or that hybridize regularly. Interestingly, DNA barcoding was found to be the most effective identification tool, outperforming external morphology, and being slightly better than male genitalia. Romania is now the first country to have a comprehensive DNA barcode reference database for butterflies. Similar barcoding efforts based on comprehensive sampling of specific geographical regions can act as functional modules that will foster the early application of DNA barcoding while a global system is under development.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The methodologies employed across studies demonstrate the power of DNA barcoding in cataloging biodiversity, with a consistent reliance on the COI gene sequence to assess species identities and genetic diversity. The first study (1) constructed a high-resolution reference library by sequencing a large number of specimens, achieving a high rate of species identification and revealing continental patterns of haplotype richness. Similarly, the second study (2) used DNA barcoding to assemble a national reference library, combining morphological and genetic techniques to achieve high species identification rates. Both studies (1, 2) acknowledged the challenge of dealing with the potential for para- and polyphyly, an issue addressed by the third study (3) through the development of the Monophylizer web service, which helped refine the identification of species in gene trees. The fourth study (4) employed species delimitation approaches to uncover cryptic diversity, comparing traditional taxonomic methods with methods like the automatic barcode gap discovery and the generalized mixed Yule coalescent model, which facilitated the recognition of potential cryptic species. Lastly, the fifth study (5) established a comprehensive DNA barcode reference library for a country's butterfly fauna, comparing morphological and genetic data to evaluate the efficacy of DNA barcoding as a primary identification tool. Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of meticulous species identification, the need for integration of morphological and genetic techniques, and the potential for DNA barcoding to enhance biodiversity inventories, while also highlighting the challenges that require methodological refinements (3).",

A high-resolution DNA barcode library for European butterflies reveals continental patterns of mitochondrial genetic diversity, with the majority of species possessing a few common haplotypes and many rare ones, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive reference datasets for correct specimen identification (1). Similarly, the assembly of a national DNA barcode reference library for Swiss butterflies and forester moths demonstrates the efficacy of integrating morphological and genetic techniques for species identification, with a high success rate in specimen classification, especially when moralogical biases are considered (2). Studies on European Lepidoptera have shown that species non-monophyly, although prevalent in mitochondrial DNA gene trees, can be substantially reduced through refined tree-building methods and increased sampling effort, suggesting that operational factors such as taxonomic limitations and identification uncertainties play a significant role in the observed diversity (3). The use of species delimitation approaches on high Andean butterflies has uncovered a substantial increase in net richness, highlighting the utility of DNA barcoding in resolving the complex interrelationships among closely related taxa (4). Lastly, the complete DNA barcode reference library for the butterfly fauna of Romania has proven highly effective, with DNA barcoding outperforming traditional morphological methods for species identification, paving the way for similar comprehensive studies across temperate regions to capitalize on the method's functional module approach (5).

High resolution DNA barcode library for European butterflies reveals continental patterns of mitochondrial genetic diversity\nAbstractThe study of global biodiversity will greatly benefit from access to comprehensive DNA barcode libraries at continental scale, but such datasets are still very rare. Here, we assemble the first high-resolution reference library for European butterflies that provides 97% taxon coverage (459 species) and 22,306 COI sequences. We estimate that we captured 62% of the total haplotype diversity and show that most species possess a few very common haplotypes and many rare ones. Specimens in the dataset have an average 95.3% probability of being correctly identified. Mitochondrial diversity displayed elevated haplotype richness in southern European refugia, establishing the generality of this key biogeographic pattern for an entire taxonomic group. Fifteen percent of the species are involved in barcode sharing, but two thirds of these cases may reflect the need for further taxonomic research. This dataset provides a unique resource for conservation and for studying evolutionary processes, cryptic species, phylogeography, and ecology.\n\n2. A DNA barcode reference library for Swiss butterflies and forester moths as a tool for species identification, systematics and conservation\nButterfly monitoring and Red List programs in Switzerland rely on a combination of observations and collection records to document changes in species distributions through time. While most butterflies can be identified using morphology, some taxa remain challenging, making it difficult to accurately map their distributions and develop appropriate conservation measures. In this paper, we explore the use of the DNA barcode (a fragment of the mitochondrial gene COI) as a tool for the identification of Swiss butterflies and forester moths (Rhopalocera and Zygaenidae). We present a national DNA barcode reference library including 868 sequences representing 217 out of 224 resident species, or 96.9% of Swiss fauna. DNA barcodes were diagnostic for nearly 90% of Swiss species. The remaining 10% represent cases of para- and polyphyly likely involving introgression or incomplete lineage sorting among closely related taxa. We demonstrate that integrative taxonomic methods incorporating a combination of morphological and genetic techniques result in a rate of species identification of over 96% in females and over 98% in males, higher than either morphology or DNA barcodes alone. We explore the use of the DNA barcode for exploring boundaries among taxa, understanding the geographical distribution of cryptic diversity and evaluating the status of purportedly endemic taxa. Finally, we discuss how DNA barcodes may be used to improve field practices and ultimately enhance conservation strategies.\n\n3. Species-Level Para- and Polyphyly in DNA Barcode Gene Trees: Strong Operational Bias in European Lepidoptera\nThe proliferation of DNA data is revolutionizing all fields of systematic research. DNA barcode sequences, now available for millions of specimens and several hundred thousand species, are increasingly used in algorithmic species delimitations. This is complicated by occasional incongruences between species and gene genealogies, as indicated by situations where conspecific individuals do not form a monophyletic cluster in a gene tree. In two previous reviews, non-monophyly has been reported as being common in mitochondrial DNA gene trees. We developed a novel web service \u201cMonophylizer\u201d to detect non-monophyly in phylogenetic trees and used it to ascertain the incidence of species non-monophyly in COI (a.k.a. cox1) barcode sequence data from 4977 species and 41,583 specimens of European Lepidoptera, the largest data set of DNA barcodes analyzed from this regard. Particular attention was paid to accurate species identification to ensure data integrity. We investigated the effects of tree-building method, sampling effort, and other methodological issues, all of which can influence estimates of non-monophyly. We found a 12% incidence of non-monophyly, a value significantly lower than that observed in previous studies. Neighbor joining (NJ) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods yielded almost equal numbers of non-monophyletic species, but 24.1% of these cases of non-monophyly were only found by one of these methods. Non-monophyletic species tend to show either low genetic distances to their nearest neighbors or exceptionally high levels of intraspecific variability. Cases of polyphyly in COI trees arising as a result of deep intraspecific divergence are negligible, as the detected cases reflected misidentifications or methodological errors. Taking into consideration variation in sampling effort, we estimate that the true incidence of non-monophyly is \u223c23%, but with operational factors still being included. Within the operational factors, we separately assessed the frequency of taxonomic limitations (presence of overlooked cryptic and oversplit species) and identification uncertainties. We observed that operational factors are potentially present in more than half (58.6%) of the detected cases of non-monophyly. Furthermore, we observed that in about 20% of non-monophyletic species and entangled species, the lineages involved are either allopatric or parapatric\u2014conditions where species delimitation is inherently subjective and particularly dependent on the species concept that has been adopted. These observations suggest that species-level non-monophyly in COI gene trees is less common than previously supposed, with many cases reflecting misidentifications, the subjectivity of species delimitation or other operational factors.\n\n4. Use of species delimitation approaches to tackle the cryptic diversity of an assemblage of high Andean butterflies (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea)\nCryptic biological diversity has generated ambiguity in taxonomic and evolutionary studies. Single-locus methods and other approaches for species delimitation are useful for addressing this challenge, enabling the practical processing of large numbers of samples for identification and inventory purposes. This study analyzed an assemblage of high Andean butterflies using DNA barcoding and compared the identifications based on the current morphological taxonomy with three methods of species delimitation (automatic barcode gap discovery, generalized mixed Yule coalescent model, and Poisson tree processes). Sixteen potential cryptic species were recognized using these three methods, representing a net richness increase of 11.3% in the assemblage. A well-studied taxon of the genus Vanessa, which has a wide geographical distribution, appeared with the potential cryptic species that had a higher genetic differentiation at the local level than at the continental level. The analyses were useful for identifying the potential cryptic species in Pedaliodes and Forsterinaria complexes, which also show differentiation along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients. This genetic assessment of an entire assemblage of high Andean butterflies (Papilionoidea) provides baseline information for future research in a region characterized by high rates of endemism and population isolation.\n\n5. Complete DNA barcode reference library for a country's butterfly fauna reveals high performance for temperate Europe\nDNA barcoding aims to accelerate species identification and discovery, but performance tests have shown marked differences in identification success. As a consequence, there remains a great need for comprehensive studies which objectively test the method in groups with a solid taxonomic framework. This study focuses on the 180 species of butterflies in Romania, accounting for about one third of the European butterfly fauna. This country includes five eco-regions, the highest of any in the European Union, and is a good representative for temperate areas. Morphology and DNA barcodes of more than 1300 specimens were carefully studied and compared. Our results indicate that 90 per cent of the species form barcode clusters allowing their reliable identification. The remaining cases involve nine closely related species pairs, some whose taxonomic status is controversial or that hybridize regularly. Interestingly, DNA barcoding was found to be the most effective identification tool, outperforming external morphology, and being slightly better than male genitalia. Romania is now the first country to have a comprehensive DNA barcode reference database for butterflies. Similar barcoding efforts based on comprehensive sampling of specific geographical regions can act as functional modules that will foster the early application of DNA barcoding while a global system is under development.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the quest to catalog biodiversity, DNA-based tools have emerged as a powerful complement to traditional taxonomic methods. The first study presents a high-resolution DNA barcode library for European butterflies, revealing continental patterns of mitochondrial genetic diversity and demonstrating the utility of barcoding in species identification, particularly in cases of cryptic species (1). Similarly, the second study constructs a comprehensive DNA barcode reference library for Swiss butterflies and forester moths, finding barcoding to be an effective tool for species identification, and highlighting the importance of integrative taxonomic approaches that combine morphological and genetic data (2). The third study challenges the prevailing assumption of high incidence of species non-monophyly in DNA barcode gene trees by analyzing European Lepidoptera and suggesting that the observed non-monophyly is more likely due to taxonomic and identification uncertainties than to methodological biases (3). The fourth study employs species delimitation approaches to uncover cryptic diversity in high Andean butterflies, identifying 16 potential new species and emphasizing the role of DNA barcoding in revealing hidden biodiversity (4). Lastly, the fifth study demonstrates the efficacy of DNA barcoding in the identification of Romanian butterfly species, outperforming traditional morphological methods and offering a promising tool for biodiversity inventories in temperate Europe (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the transformative impact of DNA-based tools in enhancing the accuracy and speed of biodiversity assessments.",

Investigations on Tailored Forming of AISI 52100 as Rolling Bearing Raceway\nHybrid cylindrical roller thrust bearing washers of type 81212 were manufactured by tailored forming. An AISI 1022M base material, featuring a sufficient strength for structural loads, was cladded with the bearing steel AISI 52100 by plasma transferred arc welding (PTA). Though AISI 52100 is generally regarded as non-weldable, it could be applied as a cladding material by adjusting PTA parameters. The cladded parts were investigated after each individual process step and subsequently tested under rolling contact load. Welding defects that could not be completely eliminated by the subsequent hot forming were characterized by means of scanning acoustic microscopy and micrographs. Below the surface, pores with a typical size of ten \u00b5m were found to a depth of about 0.45 mm. In the material transition zone and between individual weld seams, larger voids were observed. Grinding of the surface after heat treatment caused compressive residual stresses near the surface with a relatively small depth. Fatigue tests were carried out on an FE8 test rig. Eighty-two percent of the calculated rating life for conventional bearings was achieved. A high failure slope of the Weibull regression was determined. A relationship between the weld defects and the fatigue behavior is likely.\n\n2. Manufacturing and Evaluation of Multi-Material Axial-Bearing Washers by Tailored Forming\nComponents subject to rolling contact fatigue, such as gears and rolling bearings, are among the fundamental machine elements in mechanical and vehicle engineering. Rolling bearings are generally not designed to be fatigue-resistant, as the necessary oversizing is not technically and economically marketable. In order to improve the load-bearing capacity, resource efficiency and application possibilities of rolling bearings and other possible multi-material solid components, a new process chain was developed at Leibniz University Hannover as a part of the Collaborative Research Centre 1153 \u201cTailored Forming\u201d. Semi-finished products, already joined before the forming process, are used here to allow a further optimisation of joint quality by forming and finishing. In this paper, a plasma-powder-deposition welding process is presented, which enables precise material deposition and control of the welding depth. For this study, bearing washers (serving as rolling bearing raceways) of a cylindrical roller thrust bearing, similar to type 81212 with a multi-layer structure, were manufactured. A previously non-weldable high-performance material, steel AISI 5140, was used as the cladding layer. Depending on the degree of forming, grain-refinement within the welded material was achieved by thermo-mechanical treatment of the joining zone during the forming process. This grain-refinements lead to an improvement of the mechanical properties and thus, to a higher lifetime for washers of an axial cylindrical roller bearing, which were examined as an exemplary component on a fatigue test bench. To evaluate the bearing washers, the results of the bearing tests were compared with industrial bearings and deposition welded axial-bearing washers without subsequent forming. In addition, the bearing washers were analysed micro-tribologically and by scanning acoustic microscopy both after welding and after the forming process. Nano-scratch tests were carried out on the bearing washers to analyse the layer properties. Together with the results of additional microscopic images of the surface and cross-sections, the causes of failure due to fatigue and wear were identified.\n\n3. Cross-wedge rolling of PTA-welded hybrid steel billets with rolling bearing steel and hard material coatings\nWithin the Collaborative Research Centre 1153 \u201cTailored Forming\u201c a process chain for the manufacturing of hybrid high performance components is developed. Exemplary process steps consist of deposit welding of high performance steel on low-cost steel, pre-shaping by cross-wedge rolling and finishing by milling.Hard material coatings such as Stellite 6 or Delcrome 253 are used as wear or corrosion protection coatings in industrial applications. Scientists of the Institute of Material Science welded these hard material alloys onto a base material, in this case C22.8, to create a hybrid workpiece. Scientists of the Institut fur Integrierte Produktion Hannover have shown that these hybrid workpieces can be formed without defects (e.g. detachment of the coating) by cross-wedge rolling. After forming, the properties of the coatings are retained or in some cases even improved (e.g. the transition zone between base material and coating). By adjustments in the welding process, it was possible to apply the 100Cr6 rolling bearing steel, as of now declared as non-weldable, on the low-cost steel C22.8. 100Cr6 was formed afterwards in its hybrid bonding state with C22.8 by cross-wedge rolling, thus a component-integrated bearing seat was produced. Even after welding and forming, the rolling bearing steel coating could still be quench-hardened to a hardness of over 60 HRC. This paper shows the potential of forming hybrid billets to tailored parts. Since industrially available standard materials can be used for hard material coatings by this approach, even though they are not weldable by conventional methods, it is not necessary to use expensive, for welding designed materials to implement a hybrid component concept.Within the Collaborative Research Centre 1153 \u201cTailored Forming\u201c a process chain for the manufacturing of hybrid high performance components is developed.

Investigation of the material combination 20MnCr5 and X45CrSi9-3 in the Tailored Forming of shafts with bearing seats\nAbstractThe Tailored Forming process chain is used to manufacture hybrid components and consists of a joining process or Additive Manufacturing for various materials (e.g. deposition welding), subsequent hot forming, machining and heat treatment. In this way, components can be produced with materials adapted to the load case. For this paper, hybrid shafts are produced by deposition welding of a cladding made of X45CrSi9-3 onto a workpiece made from 20MnCr5. The hybrid shafts are then formed by means of cross-wedge rolling. It is investigated, how the thickness of the cladding and the type of cooling after hot forming (in air or in water) affect the properties of the cladding. The hybrid shafts are formed without layer separation. However, slight core loosening occurres in the area of the bearing seat due to the Mannesmann effect. The microhardness of the cladding is only slightly effected by the cooling strategy, while the microhardness of the base material is significantly higher in water cooled shafts. The microstructure of the cladding after both cooling strategies consists mainly of martensite. In the base material, air cooling results in a mainly ferritic microstructure with grains of ferrite-pearlite. Quenching in water results in a microstructure containing mainly martensite.\n\n5. Tribological Study on Tailored-Formed Axial Bearing Washers\nTo enhance tribological contacts under cyclic load, high performance materials are required. Utilizing the same high-strength material for the whole machine element is not resource-efficient. In order to manufacture machine elements with extended functionality and specific properties, a combination of different materials can be used in a single component for a more efficient material utilization. By combining different joining techniques with subsequent forming, multi-material or tailored components can be manufactured. To reduce material costs and energy consumption during the component service life, a less expensive lightweight material should be used for regions remote from the highly stressed zones. The scope is not only to obtain the desired shape and dimensions for the finishing process, but also to improve properties like the bond strength between different materials and the microscopic structure of the material. The multi-material approach can be applied to all components requiring different properties in separate component regions such as shafts, bearings or bushes. The current study exemplarily presents the process route for the production of an axial bearing washer by means of tailored forming technology. The bearing washers were chosen to fit axial roller bearings (type 81212). The manufacturing process starts with the laser wire cladding of a hard facing made of martensitic chromium silicon steel (1.4718) on a base substrate of S235 (1.0038) steel. Subsequently, the bearing washers are forged. After finishing, the surfaces of the bearing washers were tested in thrust bearings on an FE-8 test rig. The operational test of the bearings consists in a run-in phase at 250 rpm. A bearing failure is determined by a condition monitoring system. Before and after this, the bearings were inspected by optical and ultrasonic microscopy in order to examine whether the bond of the coat is resistant against rolling contact fatigue. The feasibility of the approach could be proven by endurance test. The joining zone was able to withstand the rolling contact stresses and the bearing failed due to material-induced fatigue with high cycle stability.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The methodologies employed across the five studies demonstrate a concerted effort to refine the formation of hard material coatings for structural applications through tailored processes. The hybrid cylindrical roller thrust bearers in (1) were manufactured using plasma transferred arc welding (PTA) to join AISI 1022M with AISI 52100, adjusting PTA parameters to overcome the non-weldability of the latter. Similarly, (2) utilized PTA welding with a subsequent forming step to optimize joint quality and grain size in rolling bearings. In (3), cross-wedge rolling was applied to PTA-welded hybrid steel billets to achieve flawless forming of hard material coatings without defects. The study in (4) explored the tailored forming of shafts with bearing seats, combining deposition welding and cross-wedge rolling to create components with adapted load-bearing capacity. Lastly, (5) employed laser wire cladding and forging, followed by finishing, to enhance the tribological properties of axial bearing washers, demonstrating the efficacy of multi-material engineering for efficient structural design. Collectively, these methodologies underscore the potential of tailored forming to overcome material incompatibilities and optimize the mechanical performance of hard material coatings in structural components (1-5).\n\n",

Investigations on Tailored Forming of AISI 52100 as Rolling Bearing Raceway\nHybrid cylindrical roller thrust bearing washers of type 81212 were manufactured by tailored forming. An AISI 1022M base material, featuring a sufficient strength for structural loads, was cladded with the bearing steel AISI 52100 by plasma transferred arc welding (PTA). Though AISI 52100 is generally regarded as non-weldable, it could be applied as a cladding material by adjusting PTA parameters. The cladded parts were investigated after each individual process step and subsequently tested under rolling contact load. Welding defects that could not be completely eliminated by the subsequent hot forming were characterized by means of scanning acoustic microscopy and micrographs. Below the surface, pores with a typical size of ten \u00b5m were found to a depth of about 0.45 mm. In the material transition zone and between individual weld seams, larger voids were observed. Grinding of the surface after heat treatment caused compressive residual stresses near the surface with a relatively small depth. Fatigue tests were carried out on an FE8 test rig. Eighty-two percent of the calculated rating life for conventional bearings was achieved. A high failure slope of the Weibull regression was determined. A relationship between the weld defects and the fatigue behavior is likely.\n\n2. Manufacturing and Evaluation of Multi-Material Axial-Bearing Washers by Tailored Forming\nComponents subject to rolling contact fatigue, such as gears and rolling bearings, are among the fundamental machine elements in mechanical and vehicle engineering. Rolling bearings are generally not designed to be fatigue-resistant, as the necessary oversizing is not technically and economically marketable. In order to improve the load-bearing capacity, resource efficiency and application possibilities of rolling bearings and other possible multi-material solid components, a new process chain was developed at Leibniz University Hannover as a part of the Collaborative Research Centre 1153 \u201cTailored Forming\u201d. Semi-finished products, already joined before the forming process, are used here to allow a further optimisation of joint quality by forming and finishing. In this paper, a plasma-powder-deposition welding process is presented, which enables precise material deposition and control of the welding depth. For this study, bearing washers (serving as rolling bearing raceways) of a cylindrical roller thrust bearing, similar to type 81212 with a multi-layer structure, were manufactured. A previously non-weldable high-performance material, steel AISI 5140, was used as the cladding layer. Depending on the degree of forming, grain-refinement within the welded material was achieved by thermo-mechanical treatment of the joining zone during the forming process. This grain-refinements lead to an improvement of the mechanical properties and thus, to a higher lifetime for washers of an axial cylindrical roller bearing, which were examined as an exemplary component on a fatigue test bench. To evaluate the bearing washers, the results of the bearing tests were compared with industrial bearings and deposition welded axial-bearing washers without subsequent forming. In addition, the bearing washers were analysed micro-tribologically and by scanning acoustic microscopy both after welding and after the forming process. Nano-scratch tests were carried out on the bearing washers to analyse the layer properties. Together with the results of additional microscopic images of the surface and cross-sections, the causes of failure due to fatigue and wear were identified.\n\n3. Cross-wedge rolling of PTA-welded hybrid steel billets with rolling bearing steel and hard material coatings\nWithin the Collaborative Research Centre 1153 \u201cTailored Forming\u201c a process chain for the manufacturing of hybrid high performance components is developed. Exemplary process steps consist of deposit welding of high performance steel on low-cost steel, pre-shaping by cross-wedge rolling and finishing by milling.Hard material coatings such as Stellite 6 or Delcrome 253 are used as wear or corrosion protection coatings in industrial applications. Scientists of the Institute of Material Science welded these hard material alloys onto a base material, in this case C22.8, to create a hybrid workpiece. Scientists of the Institut fur Integrierte Produktion Hannover have shown that these hybrid workpieces can be formed without defects (e.g. detachment of the coating) by cross-wedge rolling. After forming, the properties of the coatings are retained or in some cases even improved (e.g. the transition zone between base material and coating). By adjustments in the welding process, it was possible to apply the 100Cr6 rolling bearing steel, as of now declared as non-weldable, on the low-cost steel C22.8. 100Cr6 was formed afterwards in its hybrid bonding state with C22.8 by cross-wedge rolling, thus a component-integrated bearing seat was produced. Even after welding and forming, the rolling bearing steel coating could still be quench-hardened to a hardness of over 60 HRC. This paper shows the potential of forming hybrid billets to tailored parts. Since industrially available standard materials can be used for hard material coatings by this approach, even though they are not weldable by conventional methods, it is not necessary to use expensive, for welding designed materials to implement a hybrid component concept.Within the Collaborative Research Centre 1153 \u201cTailored Forming\u201c a process chain for the manufacturing of hybrid high performance components is developed.

Investigation of the material combination 20MnCr5 and X45CrSi9-3 in the Tailored Forming of shafts with bearing seats\nAbstractThe Tailored Forming process chain is used to manufacture hybrid components and consists of a joining process or Additive Manufacturing for various materials (e.g. deposition welding), subsequent hot forming, machining and heat treatment. In this way, components can be produced with materials adapted to the load case. For this paper, hybrid shafts are produced by deposition welding of a cladding made of X45CrSi9-3 onto a workpiece made from 20MnCr5. The hybrid shafts are then formed by means of cross-wedge rolling. It is investigated, how the thickness of the cladding and the type of cooling after hot forming (in air or in water) affect the properties of the cladding. The hybrid shafts are formed without layer separation. However, slight core loosening occurres in the area of the bearing seat due to the Mannesmann effect. The microhardness of the cladding is only slightly effected by the cooling strategy, while the microhardness of the base material is significantly higher in water cooled shafts. The microstructure of the cladding after both cooling strategies consists mainly of martensite. In the base material, air cooling results in a mainly ferritic microstructure with grains of ferrite-pearlite. Quenching in water results in a microstructure containing mainly martensite.\n\n5. Tribological Study on Tailored-Formed Axial Bearing Washers\nTo enhance tribological contacts under cyclic load, high performance materials are required. Utilizing the same high-strength material for the whole machine element is not resource-efficient. In order to manufacture machine elements with extended functionality and specific properties, a combination of different materials can be used in a single component for a more efficient material utilization. By combining different joining techniques with subsequent forming, multi-material or tailored components can be manufactured. To reduce material costs and energy consumption during the component service life, a less expensive lightweight material should be used for regions remote from the highly stressed zones. The scope is not only to obtain the desired shape and dimensions for the finishing process, but also to improve properties like the bond strength between different materials and the microscopic structure of the material. The multi-material approach can be applied to all components requiring different properties in separate component regions such as shafts, bearings or bushes. The current study exemplarily presents the process route for the production of an axial bearing washer by means of tailored forming technology. The bearing washers were chosen to fit axial roller bearings (type 81212). The manufacturing process starts with the laser wire cladding of a hard facing made of martensitic chromium silicon steel (1.4718) on a base substrate of S235 (1.0038) steel. Subsequently, the bearing washers are forged. After finishing, the surfaces of the bearing washers were tested in thrust bearings on an FE-8 test rig. The operational test of the bearings consists in a run-in phase at 250 rpm. A bearing failure is determined by a condition monitoring system. Before and after this, the bearings were inspected by optical and ultrasonic microscopy in order to examine whether the bond of the coat is resistant against rolling contact fatigue. The feasibility of the approach could be proven by endurance test. The joining zone was able to withstand the rolling contact stresses and the bearing failed due to material-induced fatigue with high cycle stability.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The application and forming of hard material coatings have been explored through various tailored forming processes, aimed at enhancing the load-bearing capacity and fatigue resistance of components. The hybrid cylindrical roller thrust bearings, manufactured by tailored forming using AISI 52100 as a cladding material, have shown promising results in terms of fatigue life, although pores and voids in the material transition zone and individual weld seams were identified as potential weaknesses (1). Similarly, the multi-material axial-bearing washers, created by plasma-powder-deposition welding and subsequent forming, have demonstrated improved mechanical properties and load-bearing capacity, with micro-tribological and scanning acoustic microscopy revealing the importance of welding defects in fatigue failure (2). Cross-wedge rolling has been identified as a method to avoid defects in hard material coatings and maintain their mechanical properties, as demonstrated by the successful formation of hybrid steel billets with rolling bearing steel (3). The tailored forming of shafts with bearing seats, using a combination of X45CrSi9-3 and 20MnCr5 materials, has shown that the thickness of the cladding and the cooling strategy can influence the properties of the cladding, with the Mannesmann effect causing core loosening in some cases (4). Lastly, the tribological study on tailored-formed axial bearing washers has highlighted the importance of selecting the right combination of materials and joining techniques to ensure the component's resistance to rolling contact fatigue and efficient material utilization (5). These studies collectively underscore the potential of tailored forming in creating hard material coatings that are not only effective but also economical in manufacturing high-performance components.",

In Paper 3, the process of cross-wedge rolling is explored to manufacture hybrid steel billets with rolling bearing steel and hard material coatings, demonstrating that this method prevents defects such as detachment of the coating and retains or enhances the properties of the coatings after forming (3). Paper 4 investigates the material combination of 20MnCr5 and X45CrSi9-3 for the tailored forming of shafts with bearing seats, finding that the thickness of the cladding and the cooling strategy after hot forming affect the microhardness and microstructure of the cladding, but not significantly the bond strength between different materials (4). Lastly, Paper 5 presents a tribological study on tailored-formed axial bearing washers, combining hard facing with tailored forming to enhance tribological contacts under cyclic load, and demonstrating that the multi-material approach can improve the endurance and material-induced fatigue resistance of bearings (5).

An unsupervised method for general named entity recognition and automated concept discovery\nKnowledge Acquisition is still the bottleneck in building many kinds of applications, such as inference engines. We describe here a procedure to automatically extend an ontology with domainspecific knowledge. The main advantage of our approach is that it is completely unsupervised, so it can be applied to different languages and domains. Our initial results have been highly successful and we believe that with some improvement in accuracy it can be applied to large ontologies.\n\n2. Enriching very large ontologies using the WWW\nThis paper explores the possibility to exploit text on the world wide web in order to enrich the concepts in existing ontologies. First, a method to retrieve documents from the WWW related to a concept is described. These document collections are used 1) to construct topic signatures (lists of topically related words) for each concept in WordNet, and 2) to build hierarchical clusters of the concepts (the word senses) that lexicalize a given word. The overall goal is to overcome two shortcomings of WordNet: the lack of topical links among concepts, and the proliferation of senses. Topic signatures are validated on a word sense disambiguation task with good results, which are improved when the hierarchical clusters are used.\n\n3. Automated discovery of WordNet relations\nThe WordNet lexical database is now quite large and offers broad coverage of general lexical relations in English. As is evident in this volume, WordNet has been employed as a resource for many applications in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR). However, many potentially useful lexical relations are currently missing from WordNet. Some of these relations, while useful for NLP and IR applications, are not necessarily appropriate for a general, domain-independent lexical database. For example, WordNet\u2019s coverage of proper nouns is rather sparse, but proper nouns are often very important in application tasks. The standard way lexicographers find new relations is to look through huge lists of concordance lines. However, culling through long lists of concordance lines can be a rather daunting task (Church and Hanks, 1990), so a method that picks out those lines that are very likely to hold relations of interest should be an improvement over more traditional techniques. This chapter describes a method for the automatic discovery of WordNetstyle lexico-semantic relations by searching for corresponding lexico-syntactic patterns in large text collections. Large text corpora are now widely available, and can be viewed as vast resources from which to mine lexical, syntactic, and semantic information. This idea is reminiscent of what is known as \u201cdata mining\u201d in the artificial intelligence literature (Fayyad and Uthurusamy, 1996), however, in this case the ore is raw text rather than tables of numerical data. The Lexico-Syntactic Pattern Extraction (LSPE) method is meant to be useful as an automated or semi-automated aid for lexicographers and builders of domain-dependent knowledge-bases. The LSPE technique is light-weight; it does not require a knowledge base or complex interpretation modules in order to suggest new WordNet relations.\n\n4. Ontology construction for information selection\nTechnology in the field of digital media generates huge amounts of non-textual information, audio, video, and images, along with more familiar textual information. The potential for exchange and retrieval of information is vast and daunting. The key problem in achieving efficient and user-friendly retrieval is the development of a search mechanism to guarantee delivery of minimal irrelevant information (high precision) while ensuring relevant information is not overlooked (high recall). The traditional solution employs keyword-based search. The only documents retrieved are those containing user specified keywords. But many documents convey desired semantic information without containing these keywords. One can overcome this problem by indexing documents according to meanings rather than words, although this will entail a way of converting words to meanings and the creation of ontology. We have solved the problem of an index structure through the design and implementation of a concept-based model using domain-dependent ontology. Ontology is a collection of concepts and their interrelationships, which provide an abstract view of an application domain. We propose a new mechanism that can generate ontology automatically in order to make our approach scalable. For this we modify the existing self-organizing tree algorithm (SOTA) that constructs a hierarchy from top to bottom. Furthermore, in order to find an appropriate concept for each node in the hierarchy we propose an automatic concept selection algorithm from WordNet called linguistic ontology. To illustrate the effectiveness of our automatic ontology construction method, we have explored our ontology construction in text documents. The Reuters21578 text document corpus has been used. We have observed that our modified SOTA outperforms hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC).\n\n5. Peppering knowledge sources with SALT: Boosting conceptual content for ontology generation\nThis paper describes work done to explore the common ground between two different ongoing research projects: the standardization of lexical and terminological resources, and the use of conceptual ontologies for information extraction and data integration. Specifically, this paper explores improving the generation of extraction ontologies through use of a comprehensive terminology database that has been represented in a standardized format for easy tool-based implementation. We show how, via the successful integration of these two distinct efforts, it is possible to leverage large-scale terminological and conceptual information having relationship-rich semantic resources in order to reformulate, match, and merge retrieved information of interest to a user.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In addressing the challenge of ontology learning from text, recent methodologies have demonstrated a variety of unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches that leverage large text corpora and linguistic resources to enhance ontology growth and generalization. The method described in (1) utilizes an unsupervised procedure to extend ontologies by automatically identifying domain-specific knowledge from text in different languages, showing promising results when applied to large ontologies. Similarly, the work in (2) explores the WWW to enrich ontologies by constructing topic signatures and hierarchical clusters of concepts, validating the efficacy of these techniques through word sense disambiguation tasks. This approach aims to address the gaps in WordNet's coverage and structure by incorporating topical links and reducing sense proliferation. In a more directed approach, the method proposed in (3) employs text collections to automatically discover WordNet-style lexico-semantic relations, focusing on lightweight techniques that do not require extensive knowledge bases or interpretation modules. This method could be particularly useful for domains where proper noun coverage is sparse in WordNet. The concept-based model in (4) tackles the problem of information selection and ontology construction by designating documents based on meanings rather than words, using a modified self-organizing tree algorithm to build the ontology hierarchy and a concept selection algorithm to assign concepts to nodes, demonstrating superior performance over hierarchical agglomerative clustering. Lastly, the integration of standardized lexical and terminological resources with conceptual ontologies, as detailed in (5), exemplifies the potential for enhancing ontology generation through the reformation, matching, and merging of retrieved information, showcasing the synergy between two distinct research efforts. Collectively, these methodologies contribute to the overarching goal of automated ontology learning from text, each offering unique perspectives on the challenges and opportunities inherent in the process (1-5).\n\n",

The LSPE technique is light-weight; it does not require a knowledge base or complex interpretation modules in order to suggest new WordNet relations.\n\n4. Ontology construction for information selection\nTechnology in the field of digital media generates huge amounts of non-textual information, audio, video, and images, along with more familiar textual information. The potential for exchange and retrieval of information is vast and daunting. The key problem in achieving efficient and user-friendly retrieval is the development of a search mechanism to guarantee delivery of minimal irrelevant information (high precision) while ensuring relevant information is not overlooked (high recall). The traditional solution employs keyword-based search. The only documents retrieved are those containing user specified keywords. But many documents convey desired semantic information without containing these keywords. One can overcome this problem by indexing documents according to meanings rather than words, although this will entail a way of converting words to meanings and the creation of ontology. We have solved the problem of an index structure through the design and implementation of a concept-based model using domain-dependent ontology. Ontology is a collection of concepts and their interrelationships, which provide an abstract view of an application domain. We propose a new mechanism that can generate ontology automatically in order to make our approach scalable. For this we modify the existing self-organizing tree algorithm (SOTA) that constructs a hierarchy from top to bottom. Furthermore, in order to find an appropriate concept for each node in the hierarchy we propose an automatic concept selection algorithm from WordNet called linguistic ontology. To illustrate the effectiveness of our automatic ontology construction method, we have explored our ontology construction in text documents. The Reuters21578 text document corpus has been used. We have observed that our modified SOTA outperforms hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC).\n\n5. Peppering knowledge sources with SALT: Boosting conceptual content for ontology generation\nThis paper describes work done to explore the common ground between two different ongoing research projects: the standardization of lexical and terminological resources, and the use of conceptual ontologies for information extraction and data integration. Specifically, this paper explores improving the generation of extraction ontologies through use of a comprehensive terminology database that has been represented in a standardized format for easy tool-based implementation. We show how, via the successful integration of these two distinct efforts, it is possible to leverage large-scale terminological and conceptual information having relationship-rich semantic resources in order to reformulate, match, and merge retrieved information of interest to a user.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the quest to enhance ontology learning from text, researchers have developed various unsupervised methods to automatically extend ontologies and discover new knowledge. One approach involves using the World Wide Web as a source of information to enrich concepts in existing ontologies, addressing the gaps in lexical links and sense proliferation by constructing topic signatures and hierarchical clusters of concepts, which have been validated through word sense disambiguation tasks (2). Another method, called Lexico-Syntactic Pattern Extraction (LSPE), employs text collections to automatically discover WordNet-style lexico-semantic relations, offering a light-weight, automated aid for lexicographers and builders of domain-dependent knowledge bases (3). Additionally, a concept-based model has been proposed, which utilizes domain-dependent ontology to index documents according to meanings, thereby improving the precision and recall of information retrieval, with a novel mechanism for generating ontology automatically through a modified self-organizing tree algorithm (4). Lastly, the integration of large-scale terminological and conceptual information has been shown to improve the generation of extraction ontologies, leveraging standardized semantic resources to reformulate, match, and merge retrieved information, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining standardization efforts with ontology learning (5). Each of these approaches contributes to the overarching goal of automating and refining the process of ontology learning from text, with a focus on unsupervised methods, language and domain adaptability, and the integration of comprehensive lexical and conceptual resources.",

An unsupervised method for general named entity recognition and automated concept discovery\nKnowledge Acquisition is still the bottleneck in building many kinds of applications, such as inference engines. We describe here a procedure to automatically extend an ontology with domainspecific knowledge. The main advantage of our approach is that it is completely unsupervised, so it can be applied to different languages and domains. Our initial results have been highly successful and we believe that with some improvement in accuracy it can be applied to large ontologies.\n\n2. An interactive tool for the rapid development of knowledge bases\nIt is widely accepted that more knowledge means more intelligence. In many knowledge intensive applications, it is necessary to have extensive domain-specific knowledge in addition to general-purpose knowledge bases. This paper presents a methodology for discovering domain-specific concepts and relationships in an attempt to extend WordNet. The method was tested on five seed concepts selected from the financial domain: interest rate, stock market, inflation, economic growth, and employment. Queries were formed with each of these concepts and a corpus of 5000 sentences was extracted automatically from the Internet and TREC-8 corpora. On this corpus, the system discovered a total of 264 new concepts not defined in WordNet, of which 221 contain the seeds and 43 are other related concepts. The system also discovered 64 relationships that link these concepts with either WordNet concepts or with each other. The relationships were extracted with the help of 22 distinct lexico-syntactic patterns representing four semantic relations. It takes the system approximately 40 minutes per seed working in interactive mode to discover the new concepts and relationships on the 5000 sentence corpus.\n\n3.

Enriching very large ontologies using the WWW\nThis paper explores the possibility to exploit text on the world wide web in order to enrich the concepts in existing ontologies. First, a method to retrieve documents from the WWW related to a concept is described. These document collections are used 1) to construct topic signatures (lists of topically related words) for each concept in WordNet, and 2) to build hierarchical clusters of the concepts (the word senses) that lexicalize a given word. The overall goal is to overcome two shortcomings of WordNet: the lack of topical links among concepts, and the proliferation of senses. Topic signatures are validated on a word sense disambiguation task with good results, which are improved when the hierarchical clusters are used.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In addressing the challenge of ontology learning from text, recent methodologies have demonstrated a variety of unsupervised and interactive approaches to enhance knowledge acquisition. The unsupervised method presented in (1) leverages a procedure to automatically extend ontologies by discovering domain-specific concepts, showing promising results with the potential for scale and language applicability. Similarly, the interactive tool described in (2) applies a method to recognize and link concepts within a specific domain, using lexico-syntactic patterns to identify relationships, thereby effectively capturing domain-specific knowledge. This approach is complemented by the integration of standardized terminological resources with conceptual ontologies, as explored in (3), which aims to improve the generation of extraction ontologies by reformulating and merging retrieved information based on relationship-rich semantic resources. In a more user-centric dimension, (4) introduces an automatic ontology construction mechanism that employs domain-dependent ontology and a concept-based model, modified from the self-organizing tree algorithm, to achieve high precision and recall in information retrieval. Lastly, (5) proposes a method to enrich very large ontologies by retrieving document collections related to each concept, constructing topic signatures, and building hierarchical clusters, which have been validated with positive results in word sense disambiguation tasks. Collectively, these methodologies underscore a trend towards leveraging standardized resources, interactive discovery, and semantic reasoning to enhance the learning and generation of ontologies from text (1-5).\n\n",

An unsupervised method for general named entity recognition and automated concept discovery\nKnowledge Acquisition is still the bottleneck in building many kinds of applications, such as inference engines. We describe here a procedure to automatically extend an ontology with domainspecific knowledge. The main advantage of our approach is that it is completely unsupervised, so it can be applied to different languages and domains. Our initial results have been highly successful and we believe that with some improvement in accuracy it can be applied to large ontologies.\n\n2. An interactive tool for the rapid development of knowledge bases\nIt is widely accepted that more knowledge means more intelligence. In many knowledge intensive applications, it is necessary to have extensive domain-specific knowledge in addition to general-purpose knowledge bases. This paper presents a methodology for discovering domain-specific concepts and relationships in an attempt to extend WordNet. The method was tested on five seed concepts selected from the financial domain: interest rate, stock market, inflation, economic growth, and employment. Queries were formed with each of these concepts and a corpus of 5000 sentences was extracted automatically from the Internet and TREC-8 corpora. On this corpus, the system discovered a total of 264 new concepts not defined in WordNet, of which 221 contain the seeds and 43 are other related concepts. The system also discovered 64 relationships that link these concepts with either WordNet concepts or with each other. The relationships were extracted with the help of 22 distinct lexico-syntactic patterns representing four semantic relations. It takes the system approximately 40 minutes per seed working in interactive mode to discover the new concepts and relationships on the 5000 sentence corpus.\n\n3. Peppering knowledge sources with SALT: Boosting conceptual content for ontology generation\nThis paper describes work done to explore the common ground between two different ongoing research projects: the standardization of lexical and terminological resources, and the use of conceptual ontologies for information extraction and data integration. Specifically, this paper explores improving the generation of extraction ontologies through use of a comprehensive terminology database that has been represented in a standardized format for easy tool-based implementation. We show how, via the successful integration of these two distinct efforts, it is possible to leverage large-scale terminological and conceptual information having relationship-rich semantic resources in order to reformulate, match, and merge retrieved information of interest to a user.\n\n4. Ontology construction for information selection\nTechnology in the field of digital media generates huge amounts of non-textual information, audio, video, and images, along with more familiar textual information. The potential for exchange and retrieval of information is vast and daunting. The key problem in achieving efficient and user-friendly retrieval is the development of a search mechanism to guarantee delivery of minimal irrelevant information (high precision) while ensuring relevant information is not overlooked (high recall). The traditional solution employs keyword-based search. The only documents retrieved are those containing user specified keywords. But many documents convey desired semantic information without containing these keywords. One can overcome this problem by indexing documents according to meanings rather than words, although this will entail a way of converting words to meanings and the creation of ontology. We have solved the problem of an index structure through the design and implementation of a concept-based model using domain-dependent ontology. Ontology is a collection of concepts and their interrelationships, which provide an abstract view of an application domain. We propose a new mechanism that can generate ontology automatically in order to make our approach scalable. For this we modify the existing self-organizing tree algorithm (SOTA) that constructs a hierarchy from top to bottom. Furthermore, in order to find an appropriate concept for each node in the hierarchy we propose an automatic concept selection algorithm from WordNet called linguistic ontology. To illustrate the effectiveness of our automatic ontology construction method, we have explored our ontology construction in text documents. The Reuters21578 text document corpus has been used. We have observed that our modified SOTA outperforms hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC).\n\n5. Enriching very large ontologies using the WWW\nThis paper explores the possibility to exploit text on the world wide web in order to enrich the concepts in existing ontologies. First, a method to retrieve documents from the WWW related to a concept is described. These document collections are used 1) to construct topic signatures (lists of topically related words) for each concept in WordNet, and 2) to build hierarchical clusters of the concepts (the word senses) that lexicalize a given word. The overall goal is to overcome two shortcomings of WordNet: the lack of topical links among concepts, and the proliferation of senses. Topic signatures are validated on a word sense disambiguation task with good results, which are improved when the hierarchical clusters are used.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of ontology learning from text, the first paper introduces an unsupervised method for enhancing general named entity recognition and advancing concept discovery by automatically extending ontologies through language and domain-specific knowledge, demonstrating significant success and promising for large ontology applications (1). The second study presents an interactive tool that leverages WordNet to rapidly develop knowledge bases, particularly in the financial domain, where it discovers 264 new concepts and 64 relationships within a corpus of 5000 sentences, highlighting the efficiency of its interactive mode in recognizing domain-specific concepts (2). The third paper explores the integration of standardized lexical and terminological resources with conceptual ontologies for information extraction and data integration, thereby improving the generation of ontologies and enhancing the match and merge of retrieved information (3). The fourth paper addresses the challenge of precise and user-friendly information retrieval in digital media by proposing an ontology construction method that indexes documents based on meanings rather than words, employing a concept-based model and an automatic concept selection algorithm to achieve higher recall and precision (4). Lastly, the fifth paper explores the potential of the World Wide Web to enrich very large ontologies, presenting a method to retrieve documents related to concepts in WordNet and using these collections to construct topic signatures and hierarchical clusters, which are validated on a word sense disambiguation task, showing improved results (5).

A notation for Knowledge-Intensive Processes\nBusiness process modeling has become essential for managing organizational knowledge artifacts. However, this is not an easy task, especially when it comes to the so-called Knowledge-Intensive Processes (KIPs). A KIP comprises activities based on acquisition, sharing, storage, and (re)use of knowledge, as well as collaboration among participants, so that the amount of value added to the organization depends on process agents' knowledge. The previously developed Knowledge Intensive Process Ontology (KIPO) structures all the concepts (and relationships among them) to make a KIP explicit. Nevertheless, KIPO does not include a graphical notation, which is crucial for KIP stakeholders to reach a common understanding about it. This paper proposes the Knowledge Intensive Process Notation (KIPN), a notation for building knowledge-intensive processes graphical models.\n\n2. Modeling Techniques for Knowledge Management\nKnowledge management is an umbrella concept for different management tasks and activities. Various modeling abstractions and techniques have been developed providing specialized support for different knowledge management tasks. This article gives an overview of modeling abstractions that are frequently discussed in the knowledge management literature as well as some promising techniques in a mature research state. Six groups of modeling techniques are presented and additionally evaluated with respect to their suitability for different fields of applications within the knowledge management domain.\n\n3. Modeling Knowledge Work for the Design of Knowledge Infrastructures\nDuring the last years, a large number of information and communication technologies (ICT) have been proposed to be supportive of knowledge management (KM). Several KM instruments have been developed and implemented in many organizations that require support by ICT. Recently, many of these technologies are bundled in the form of comprehensive, enterprise-wide knowledge infrastructures. The implementation of both, instruments and infrastructures, requires adequate modeling techniques that consider the specifics of modeling context in knowledge work. The paper studies knowledge work, KM instruments and knowledge infrastructures. Modeling techniques are reviewed, especially for business process management and activity theory. The concept of knowledge stance is discussed in order to relate functions from process models to actions from activity theory, thus detailing the context relevant for knowledge work.\n\n4. Knowledge modelling in weakly\u2010structured business processes\nIn this paper we present a new approach for integrating knowledge management and business process management. We focus on the modelling of weakly\u2010structured knowledge\u2010intensive business processes. We develop a framework for modelling this type of processes that explicitly considers knowledge\u2010related tasks and knowledge objects and present a workflow tool that is an implementation of our theoretical meta\u2010model. As an example, we sketch one case study, the process for granting full old age pension as it is performed in the Greek Social Security Institution. Finally we briefly describe some related approaches and compare them to our work and draw the main conclusions and further research directions.\n\n5. Modelling knowledge transfer: A knowledge dynamics perspective\nThe increasing complexity in design activities leads designers to collaborate and share knowledge within distributed teams. This makes designers use systems such as knowledge management systems to reach their goal. In this article, our aim is to investigate on improving the use of knowledge management systems by defining a framework for modelling knowledge transfer in such context. The proposed framework is partly based on reuse of existing models found in the literature and on a participant observation methodology. Then, we tested this framework through several case studies presented in this article. These investigations enable us to observe, define and model more finely the knowledge dynamics that occur between knowledge workers and knowledge management systems.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of enterprise engineering, particularly in the context of knowledge-intensive processes (KIPs), methodologies for modeling and notation have been pivotal for effective communication and understanding among stakeholders. The development of the Knowledge Intensive Process Ontology (KIPO) provided a foundational structure for explicating KIPs, although it lacked a graphical modeling system (1). Addressing this gap, the introduction of the Knowledge Intensive Process Notation (KIPN) as a visual representation of KIPs has been instrumental in enhancing the understanding of these processes (1). \n\nThe field of knowledge management (KM) itself has seen a variety of modeling abstractions and techniques, each tailored to support different aspects of KM tasks. These include business process management (BPM) techniques, which are frequently discussed in the literature, as well as more specialized methods such as activity theory and knowledge stance, which help to delineate the context of knowledge work within knowledge infrastructures (2, 3). The integration of KM and BPM is further explored in the modeling of weakly-structured knowledge-intensive business processes, which considers the explicit inclusion of knowledge-related tasks and objects within process models (4). This approach is complemented by a knowledge dynamics perspective, which investigates the finer details of knowledge transfer within distributed design teams, utilizing frameworks that incorporate participant observation and case studies to inform the development of knowledge management systems (5).\n\nOverall, these methodologies collectively contribute to the research problem by offering a multi-faceted approach to the modeling and notation of knowledge-intensive processes within enterprise engineering. From the graphical representation of KIPs to the specialized support of KM tasks and the dynamics of knowledge transfer, these methodologies provide a comprehensive toolkit for the effective management and improvement of knowledge within organizational contexts.\n\n",

A notation for Knowledge-Intensive Processes\nBusiness process modeling has become essential for managing organizational knowledge artifacts. However, this is not an easy task, especially when it comes to the so-called Knowledge-Intensive Processes (KIPs). A KIP comprises activities based on acquisition, sharing, storage, and (re)use of knowledge, as well as collaboration among participants, so that the amount of value added to the organization depends on process agents' knowledge. The previously developed Knowledge Intensive Process Ontology (KIPO) structures all the concepts (and relationships among them) to make a KIP explicit. Nevertheless, KIPO does not include a graphical notation, which is crucial for KIP stakeholders to reach a common understanding about it. This paper proposes the Knowledge Intensive Process Notation (KIPN), a notation for building knowledge-intensive processes graphical models.\n\n2. Modeling Techniques for Knowledge Management\nKnowledge management is an umbrella concept for different management tasks and activities. Various modeling abstractions and techniques have been developed providing specialized support for different knowledge management tasks. This article gives an overview of modeling abstractions that are frequently discussed in the knowledge management literature as well as some promising techniques in a mature research state. Six groups of modeling techniques are presented and additionally evaluated with respect to their suitability for different fields of applications within the knowledge management domain.\n\n3. Modeling Knowledge Work for the Design of Knowledge Infrastructures\nDuring the last years, a large number of information and communication technologies (ICT) have been proposed to be supportive of knowledge management (KM). Several KM instruments have been developed and implemented in many organizations that require support by ICT. Recently, many of these technologies are bundled in the form of comprehensive, enterprise-wide knowledge infrastructures. The implementation of both, instruments and infrastructures, requires adequate modeling techniques that consider the specifics of modeling context in knowledge work. The paper studies knowledge work, KM instruments and knowledge infrastructures. Modeling techniques are reviewed, especially for business process management and activity theory. The concept of knowledge stance is discussed in order to relate functions from process models to actions from activity theory, thus detailing the context relevant for knowledge work.\n\n4. Knowledge modelling in weakly\u2010structured business processes\nIn this paper we present a new approach for integrating knowledge management and business process management. We focus on the modelling of weakly\u2010structured knowledge\u2010intensive business processes. We develop a framework for modelling this type of processes that explicitly considers knowledge\u2010related tasks and knowledge objects and present a workflow tool that is an implementation of our theoretical meta\u2010model. As an example, we sketch one case study, the process for granting full old age pension as it is performed in the Greek Social Security Institution. Finally we briefly describe some related approaches and compare them to our work and draw the main conclusions and further research directions.\n\n5. Modelling knowledge transfer: A knowledge dynamics perspective\nThe increasing complexity in design activities leads designers to collaborate and share knowledge within distributed teams. This makes designers use systems such as knowledge management systems to reach their goal. In this article, our aim is to investigate on improving the use of knowledge management systems by defining a framework for modelling knowledge transfer in such context. The proposed framework is partly based on reuse of existing models found in the literature and on a participant observation methodology. Then, we tested this framework through several case studies presented in this article. These investigations enable us to observe, define and model more finely the knowledge dynamics that occur between knowledge workers and knowledge management systems.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of enterprise engineering, the challenge of modeling Knowledge-Intensive Processes (KIPs) is a significant area of research. Paper 1 introduces the Knowledge Intensive Process Notation (KIPN), which is a graphical model that aids in the understanding of KIPs by stakeholders, focusing on the acquisition, sharing, storage, and reuse of knowledge within these processes (1). Paper 2 provides a comprehensive overview of modeling abstractions and techniques for Knowledge Management (KM), evaluating their suitability for various applications within the KM domain, and highlights six groups of modeling techniques, enhancing the understanding of KM tasks and activities (2). Paper 3 delves into the design of knowledge infrastructures, emphasizing the need for modeling techniques that consider the specifics of knowledge work. It reviews existing modeling techniques, such as business process management and activity theory, and introduces the concept of knowledge stance to bridge functions and actions within knowledge work contexts (3). Paper 4 presents a framework for modeling weakly-structured knowledge-intensive business processes, integrating knowledge management with business process management. It highlights the importance of considering knowledge-related tasks and objects within these processes, as demonstrated through a case study of the Greek Social Security Institution's pension granting process (4). Lastly, Paper 5 focuses on the modeling of knowledge transfer, adopting a knowledge dynamics perspective. It develops a framework to improve the use of knowledge management systems by designers, drawing from literature and participant observation, and validates the framework through case studies, thereby refining the understanding of knowledge workers' interactions with these systems (5). Together, these papers contribute to the advancement of enterprise engineering by enhancing the understanding of knowledge processes, management, and transfer within organizational contexts.\n\n",

Understanding Smart Cities: An Integrative Framework\nMaking a city \"smart\" is emerging as a strategy to mitigate the problems generated by the urban population growth and rapid urbanization. Yet little academic research has sparingly discussed the phenomenon. To close the gap in the literature about smart cities and in response to the increasing use of the concept, this paper proposes a framework to understand the concept of smart cities. Based on the exploration of a wide and extensive array of literature from various disciplinary areas we identify eight critical factors of smart city initiatives: management and organization, technology, governance, policy context, people and communities, economy, built infrastructure, and natural environment. These factors form the basis of an integrative framework that can be used to examine how local governments are envisioning smart city initiatives. The framework suggests directions and agendas for smart city research and outlines practical implications for government professionals.\n\n2. Smart cities of the future\nHere we sketch the rudiments of what constitutes a smart city which we define as a city in which ICT is merged with traditional infrastructures, coordinated and integrated using new digital technologies. We first sketch our vision defining seven goals which concern: developing a new understanding of urban problems; effective and feasible ways to coordinate urban technologies; models and methods for using urban data across spatial and temporal scales; developing new technologies for communication and dissemination; developing new forms of urban governance and organisation; defining critical problems relating to cities, transport, and energy; and identifying risk, uncertainty, and hazards in the smart city. To this, we add six research challenges: to relate the infrastructure of smart cities to their operational functioning and planning through management, control and optimisation; to explore the notion of the city as a laboratory for innovation; to provide portfolios of urban simulation which inform future designs; to develop technologies that ensure equity, fairness and realise a better quality of city life; to develop technologies that ensure informed participation and create shared knowledge for democratic city governance; and to ensure greater and more effective mobility and access to opportunities for urban populations. We begin by defining the state of the art, explaining the science of smart cities. We define six scenarios based on new cities badging themselves as smart, older cities regenerating themselves as smart, the development of science parks, tech cities, and technopoles focused on high technologies, the development of urban services using contemporary ICT, the use of ICT to develop new urban intelligence functions, and the development of online and mobile forms of participation. Seven project areas are then proposed: Integrated Databases for the Smart City, Sensing, Networking and the Impact of New Social Media, Modelling Network Performance, Mobility and Travel Behaviour, Modelling Urban Land Use, Transport and Economic Interactions, Modelling Urban Transactional Activities in Labour and Housing Markets, Decision Support as Urban Intelligence, Participatory Governance and Planning Structures for the Smart City. Finally we anticipate the paradigm shifts that will occur in this research and define a series of key demonstrators which we believe are important to progressing a science of smart cities\n\n3. Distributed Framework for Electronic Democracy in Smart Cities\nArchitectural modules based on dual citizen and government participation platforms provide an economically viable way to implement, standardize, and scale services and information exchange-functions essential to citizens' participation in a smart city democracy.\n\n4. Towards a smart State? Inter-agency collaboration, information integration, and beyond\nInformation technologies IT can now be considered one of the key components of government administrative reform. The potential is even greater when working across organizational boundaries. Unfortunately, inter-agency collaboration appears to face an even greater number of challenges than similar IT initiatives within a single organization. The challenges include data and technological incompatibility, the lack of institutional incentives to collaborate, and the politics and power struggles around a pervasive silo structure in most governments, among many others. This paper argues that there are clear trends towards greater inter-organizational collaboration, information sharing, and integration, which could lead, in the near future, to what might be called a smart State. The paper starts discussing the promises and challenges that have already been identified for government information sharing and integration initiatives. Then it describes two trends in terms of inter-organizational collaboration and information technologies in government settings. The paper ends by providing reflections about the technical and political feasibility, as well as the social desirability, of an integrated virtual State in which the executive, legislative, and judicial branches^1 are actively collaborating and sharing information through the use of advanced information technologies, sophisticated coordination mechanisms, shared physical infrastructure, and, potentially, new organizational and institutional arrangements.\n\n5. Smart Ideas for Smart Cities: Investigating Crowdsourcing for Generating and Selecting Ideas for ICT Innovation in a City Context\nWithin this article, the strengths and weaknesses of crowdsourcing for idea generation and idea selection in the context of smart city innovation are investigated. First, smart cities are defined next to similar but different concepts such as digital cities, intelligent cities or ubiquitous cities. It is argued that the smart city-concept is in fact a more user-centered evolution of the other city-concepts which seem to be more technological deterministic in nature. The principles of crowdsourcing are explained and the different manifestations are demonstrated. By means of a case study, the generation of ideas for innovative uses of ICT for city innovation by citizens through an online platform is studied, as well as the selection process. For this selection, a crowdsourcing solution is compared to a selection made by external experts. The comparison of both indicates that using the crowd as gatekeeper and selector of innovative ideas yields a long list with high user benefits. However, the generation of ideas in itself appeared not to deliver extremely innovative ideas. Crowdsourcing thus appears to be a useful and effective tool in the context of smart city innovation, but should be thoughtfully used and combined with other user involvement approaches and within broader frameworks such as Living Labs.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the quest to understand and realize the vision of smart cities, diverse methodologies have been employed to integrate and coordinate the vast array of ICT and traditional infrastructures within urban contexts. An integrative framework proposes eight critical factors to examine smart city initiatives, focusing on management, organization, technology, governance, policy, people, economy, and environment (1). This framework is complemented by a vision-based approach that identifies goals and challenges for smart city development, suggesting methodologies such as urban simulation and participatory governance to inform city planning and design (2). In the realm of electronic democracy, a distributed framework utilizes dual-platform architecture to facilitate citizen participation and information exchange between government agencies, highlighting the importance of standardization and scale in urban governance (3). Inter-agency collaboration and information integration within government structures are further explored, acknowledging the challenges of data incompatibility and institutional barriers, yet emphasizing the potential for a digitally connected 'smart State' (4). Lastly, crowdsourcing emerges as a method for generating and selecting ICT innovation ideas, with case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of citizen-driven idea selection, although the generation of these ideas through crowdsourcing is found to be less innovative (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the multifaceted nature of smart city research, combining theoretical frameworks, vision-based planning, practical governance structures, and participatory democracies to shape the digital future of urban living.\n\n",

Towards a smart State? Inter-agency collaboration, information integration, and beyond\nInformation technologies IT can now be considered one of the key components of government administrative reform. The potential is even greater when working across organizational boundaries. Unfortunately, inter-agency collaboration appears to face an even greater number of challenges than similar IT initiatives within a single organization. The challenges include data and technological incompatibility, the lack of institutional incentives to collaborate, and the politics and power struggles around a pervasive silo structure in most governments, among many others. This paper argues that there are clear trends towards greater inter-organizational collaboration, information sharing, and integration, which could lead, in the near future, to what might be called a smart State. The paper starts discussing the promises and challenges that have already been identified for government information sharing and integration initiatives. Then it describes two trends in terms of inter-organizational collaboration and information technologies in government settings. The paper ends by providing reflections about the technical and political feasibility, as well as the social desirability, of an integrated virtual State in which the executive, legislative, and judicial branches^1 are actively collaborating and sharing information through the use of advanced information technologies, sophisticated coordination mechanisms, shared physical infrastructure, and, potentially, new organizational and institutional arrangements.\n\n5. Smart Ideas for Smart Cities: Investigating Crowdsourcing for Generating and Selecting Ideas for ICT Innovation in a City Context\nWithin this article, the strengths and weaknesses of crowdsourcing for idea generation and idea selection in the context of smart city innovation are investigated. First, smart cities are defined next to similar but different concepts such as digital cities, intelligent cities or ubiquitous cities. It is argued that the smart city-concept is in fact a more user-centered evolution of the other city-concepts which seem to be more technological deterministic in nature. The principles of crowdsourcing are explained and the different manifestations are demonstrated. By means of a case study, the generation of ideas for innovative uses of ICT for city innovation by citizens through an online platform is studied, as well as the selection process. For this selection, a crowdsourcing solution is compared to a selection made by external experts. The comparison of both indicates that using the crowd as gatekeeper and selector of innovative ideas yields a long list with high user benefits. However, the generation of ideas in itself appeared not to deliver extremely innovative ideas. Crowdsourcing thus appears to be a useful and effective tool in the context of smart city innovation, but should be thoughtfully used and combined with other user involvement approaches and within broader frameworks such as Living Labs.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The concept of smart cities is evolving as a response to the challenges posed by urban population growth and rapid urbanization, with a focus on integrating information and communication technologies (ICT) with traditional infrastructures to enhance urban functionality and livability (1, 2). Research suggests a multifaceted approach to understanding smart cities, identifying critical factors such as management and organization, technology, governance, policy context, and environmental considerations, which form an integrative framework for examining local government initiatives (1). Crowdsourcing and inter-agency collaboration are emerging as significant factors in the generation and selection of ICT innovation ideas, with the potential to yield user-centered, effective, and beneficial solutions for smart city development (5). The integration of smart city initiatives with existing urban structures and services is crucial, as is the development of new urban intelligence and participation mechanisms to ensure equitable and democratic decision-making processes (2, 3, 4). Furthermore, the fusion of physical and virtual platforms is anticipated to create a seamless, interconnected urban environment, which may ultimately lead to a \"smart State\" (4). Despite the promises of smart city initiatives, challenges such as data incompatibility and institutional resistance persist, requiring innovative governance models and infrastructure to realize the full potential of smart city transformations (2, 4, 5).\n\n",

Understanding Smart Cities: An Integrative Framework\nMaking a city \"smart\" is emerging as a strategy to mitigate the problems generated by the urban population growth and rapid urbanization. Yet little academic research has sparingly discussed the phenomenon. To close the gap in the literature about smart cities and in response to the increasing use of the concept, this paper proposes a framework to understand the concept of smart cities. Based on the exploration of a wide and extensive array of literature from various disciplinary areas we identify eight critical factors of smart city initiatives: management and organization, technology, governance, policy context, people and communities, economy, built infrastructure, and natural environment. These factors form the basis of an integrative framework that can be used to examine how local governments are envisioning smart city initiatives. The framework suggests directions and agendas for smart city research and outlines practical implications for government professionals.\n\n2. Smart cities of the future\nHere we sketch the rudiments of what constitutes a smart city which we define as a city in which ICT is merged with traditional infrastructures, coordinated and integrated using new digital technologies. We first sketch our vision defining seven goals which concern: developing a new understanding of urban problems; effective and feasible ways to coordinate urban technologies; models and methods for using urban data across spatial and temporal scales; developing new technologies for communication and dissemination; developing new forms of urban governance and organisation; defining critical problems relating to cities, transport, and energy; and identifying risk, uncertainty, and hazards in the smart city. To this, we add six research challenges: to relate the infrastructure of smart cities to their operational functioning and planning through management, control and optimisation; to explore the notion of the city as a laboratory for innovation; to provide portfolios of urban simulation which inform future designs; to develop technologies that ensure equity, fairness and realise a better quality of city life; to develop technologies that ensure informed participation and create shared knowledge for democratic city governance; and to ensure greater and more effective mobility and access to opportunities for urban populations. We begin by defining the state of the art, explaining the science of smart cities. We define six scenarios based on new cities badging themselves as smart, older cities regenerating themselves as smart, the development of science parks, tech cities, and technopoles focused on high technologies, the development of urban services using contemporary ICT, the use of ICT to develop new urban intelligence functions, and the development of online and mobile forms of participation. Seven project areas are then proposed: Integrated Databases for the Smart City, Sensing, Networking and the Impact of New Social Media, Modelling Network Performance, Mobility and Travel Behaviour, Modelling Urban Land Use, Transport and Economic Interactions, Modelling Urban Transactional Activities in Labour and Housing Markets, Decision Support as Urban Intelligence, Participatory Governance and Planning Structures for the Smart City. Finally we anticipate the paradigm shifts that will occur in this research and define a series of key demonstrators which we believe are important to progressing a science of smart cities\n\n3.

This framework provides a clear agenda for smart city research and practical implications for government professionals (1). \"Smart cities of the future\" envisions the evolution of smart cities by sketching seven goals and six research challenges, focusing on the integration of ICT with traditional infrastructures and the development of new urban technologies. The article also provides a comprehensive overview of various smart city scenarios and suggests project areas for future research (2). \"Distributed Framework for Electronic Democracy in Smart Cities\" introduces a framework based on dual citizen and government participation platforms, which offers an economical approach to implementing and scaling services in smart city democracy (3). \"Towards a smart State?\" explores the potential of inter-agency collaboration and information integration as key components of government administrative reform, highlighting the challenges and trends towards a smart State (4). Lastly, \"Smart Ideas for Smart Cities\" investigates the crowdsourcing approach for generating and selecting ICT innovation ideas in a city context, concluding that while crowdsourcing is a useful tool, it should be combined with other user involvement methods within broader frameworks (5). Together, these papers provide a comprehensive understanding of the concept of smart cities, from their foundational framework to their potential evolution and the role of crowdsourcing in their development.",

Governance Infrastructures in 2020\nA governance infrastructure is the collection of technologies and systems, people, policies, practices, and relationships that interact to support governing activities. Information technology, especially communication and computational technologies, continues to augment society\u2019s ability to organize, interact, and govern. As we think about the future of governance, this article challenges us to move beyond questions of how to best manage government institutions to how to design smart governance systems with the appropriate incentives and rules to harness and coordinate the enthusiasm and capabilities of those governed. This article anticipates how the interaction of technology and society can be leveraged to mindfully design an interaction-defined, participation-based governance infrastructure to return power to the people while increasing accountability. Supporting examples of such governance approaches already exist and are regularly emerging in distributed organizations, online communities, nonprofits, and governments.\n\n2. Smart Cities in Europe\nUrban performance currently depends not only on a city's endowment of hard infrastructure (physical capital), but also, and increasingly so, on the availability and quality of knowledge communication and social infrastructure (human and social capital). The latter form of capital is decisive for urban competitiveness. Against this background, the concept of the \u201csmart city\u201d has recently been introduced as a strategic device to encompass modern urban production factors in a common framework and, in particular, to highlight the importance of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the last 20 years for enhancing the competitive profile of a city. The present paper aims to shed light on the often elusive definition of the concept of the \u201csmart city.\u201d We provide a focused and operational definition of this construct and present consistent evidence on the geography of smart cities in the EU27. Our statistical and graphical analyses exploit in depth, for the first time to our knowledge, the most recent version of the Urban Audit data set in order to analyze the factors determining the performance of smart cities. We find that the presence of a creative class, the quality of and dedicated attention to the urban environment, the level of education, and the accessibility to and use of ICTs for public administration are all positively correlated with urban wealth. This result prompts the formulation of a new strategic agenda for European cities that will allow them to achieve sustainable urban development and a better urban landscape.\n\n3. Smart networked cities?\nThis paper aims to critically assess the lack of a global inter-urban perspective in the smart city policy framework from a conceptual standpoint. We argue here that the smart city policy agenda should be informed by and address the structure of transnational urban networks as this can affect the efficiency of such local policies. The significance of this global network structure is essential as cities do not exist in a vacuum. On the contrary, urban development is heavily based on urban interdependencies found at a global scale. After critically analyzing smart city characteristics and the world city network literature, we identify the need for global urban interdependencies to be addressed in a smart city policy framework. While this paper approaches this issue from a theoretical standpoint, some policy examples are also provided.\n\n4. Conceptualizing smart city with dimensions of technology, people, and institutions\nThis conceptual paper discusses how we can consider a particular city as a smart one, drawing on recent practices to make cities smart. A set of the common multidimensional components underlying the smart city concept and the core factors for a successful smart city initiative is identified by exploring current working definitions of smart city and a diversity of various conceptual relatives similar to smart city. The paper offers strategic principles aligning to the three main dimensions (technology, people, and institutions) of smart city: integration of infrastructures and technology-mediated services, social learning for strengthening human infrastructure, and governance for institutional improvement and citizen engagement.\n\n5. Will the real smart city please stand up?: Intelligent, progressive or entrepreneurial?\nDebates about the future of urban development in many Western countries have been increasingly influenced by discussions of smart cities. Yet despite numerous examples of this \u2018urban labelling\u2019 phenomenon, we know surprisingly little about so\u2010called smart cities, particularly in terms of what the label ideologically reveals as well as hides. Due to its lack of definitional precision, not to mention an underlying self\u2010congratulatory tendency, the main thrust of this article is to provide a preliminary critical polemic against some of the more rhetorical aspects of smart cities. The primary focus is on the labelling process adopted by some designated smart cities, with a view to problematizing a range of elements that supposedly characterize this new urban form, as well as question some of the underlying assumptions/contradictions hidden within the concept. To aid this critique, the article explores to what extent labelled smart cities can be understood as a high\u2010tech variation of the \u2018entrepreneurial city\u2019, as well as speculates on some general principles which would make them more progressive and inclusive.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In exploring the methodologies employed to understand and enhance smart cities, the research literature presents a diverse array of approaches that emphasize the interplay between technology, human interaction, and governance structures. The concept of governance infrastructures takes a proactive approach, highlighting the need for smart governance systems that leverage technology to empower citizens and enhance accountability, with examples of emerging governance models found in various organizational structures (1). Similarly, the European context is analyzed through statistical and graphical analyses of urban audit data, focusing on the correlation between various factors such as a creative class, environmental quality, and ICT accessibility in determining urban wealth, thereby proposing a strategic agenda for European cities (2). A more criticized approach is taken by the authors of the third paper, who argue for a global inter-urban perspective and emphasize the need for smart city policies to address the interdependencies between urban networks at a transnational scale, although they do not provide a specific methodological framework for this analysis (3). The fourth paper adopts a conceptual approach, identifying the core factors for successful smart city initiatives by integrating technology, social learning, and governance dimensions, offering strategic principles for smart city development (4). Lastly, the fifth paper employs a critical polemic methodology, questioning the ideological implications of the smart city label and the underlying assumptions and contradictions within the concept, suggesting a progressive and inclusive adaptation of smart city principles (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the complexity of smart city transformations and the necessity for multifaceted, interdisciplinary, and contextually aware analytical frameworks to realize the full potential of urban digitalization.\n\n",

Governance Infrastructures in 2020\nA governance infrastructure is the collection of technologies and systems, people, policies, practices, and relationships that interact to support governing activities. Information technology, especially communication and computational technologies, continues to augment society\u2019s ability to organize, interact, and govern. As we think about the future of governance, this article challenges us to move beyond questions of how to best manage government institutions to how to design smart governance systems with the appropriate incentives and rules to harness and coordinate the enthusiasm and capabilities of those governed. This article anticipates how the interaction of technology and society can be leveraged to mindfully design an interaction-defined, participation-based governance infrastructure to return power to the people while increasing accountability. Supporting examples of such governance approaches already exist and are regularly emerging in distributed organizations, online communities, nonprofits, and governments.\n\n2. Smart Cities in Europe\nUrban performance currently depends not only on a city's endowment of hard infrastructure (physical capital), but also, and increasingly so, on the availability and quality of knowledge communication and social infrastructure (human and social capital). The latter form of capital is decisive for urban competitiveness. Against this background, the concept of the \u201csmart city\u201d has recently been introduced as a strategic device to encompass modern urban production factors in a common framework and, in particular, to highlight the importance of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the last 20 years for enhancing the competitive profile of a city. The present paper aims to shed light on the often elusive definition of the concept of the \u201csmart city.\u201d We provide a focused and operational definition of this construct and present consistent evidence on the geography of smart cities in the EU27. Our statistical and graphical analyses exploit in depth, for the first time to our knowledge, the most recent version of the Urban Audit data set in order to analyze the factors determining the performance of smart cities. We find that the presence of a creative class, the quality of and dedicated attention to the urban environment, the level of education, and the accessibility to and use of ICTs for public administration are all positively correlated with urban wealth. This result prompts the formulation of a new strategic agenda for European cities that will allow them to achieve sustainable urban development and a better urban landscape.\n\n3. Smart networked cities?\nThis paper aims to critically assess the lack of a global inter-urban perspective in the smart city policy framework from a conceptual standpoint. We argue here that the smart city policy agenda should be informed by and address the structure of transnational urban networks as this can affect the efficiency of such local policies. The significance of this global network structure is essential as cities do not exist in a vacuum. On the contrary, urban development is heavily based on urban interdependencies found at a global scale. After critically analyzing smart city characteristics and the world city network literature, we identify the need for global urban interdependencies to be addressed in a smart city policy framework. While this paper approaches this issue from a theoretical standpoint, some policy examples are also provided.\n\n4. Conceptualizing smart city with dimensions of technology, people, and institutions\nThis conceptual paper discusses how we can consider a particular city as a smart one, drawing on recent practices to make cities smart. A set of the common multidimensional components underlying the smart city concept and the core factors for a successful smart city initiative is identified by exploring current working definitions of smart city and a diversity of various conceptual relatives similar to smart city. The paper offers strategic principles aligning to the three main dimensions (technology, people, and institutions) of smart city: integration of infrastructures and technology-mediated services, social learning for strengthening human infrastructure, and governance for institutional improvement and citizen engagement.\n\n5. Will the real smart city please stand up?: Intelligent, progressive or entrepreneurial?\nDebates about the future of urban development in many Western countries have been increasingly influenced by discussions of smart cities. Yet despite numerous examples of this \u2018urban labelling\u2019 phenomenon, we know surprisingly little about so\u2010called smart cities, particularly in terms of what the label ideologically reveals as well as hides. Due to its lack of definitional precision, not to mention an underlying self\u2010congratulatory tendency, the main thrust of this article is to provide a preliminary critical polemic against some of the more rhetorical aspects of smart cities. The primary focus is on the labelling process adopted by some designated smart cities, with a view to problematizing a range of elements that supposedly characterize this new urban form, as well as question some of the underlying assumptions/contradictions hidden within the concept. To aid this critique, the article explores to what extent labelled smart cities can be understood as a high\u2010tech variation of the \u2018entrepreneurial city\u2019, as well as speculates on some general principles which would make them more progressive and inclusive.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The concept of \"smart cities\" has evolved as a response to the convergence of technology and societal needs, with governance infrastructure and urban performance at its core (1). In Europe, smart cities are recognized for their ability to enhance competitiveness through the strategic use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), with factors such as the presence of a creative class, environmental quality, and public administration accessibility playing a significant role in urban wealth (2). However, this concept is influenced by global inter-urban networks, emphasizing the importance of transnational connections in local policy frameworks (3). Conceptualizations of smart cities tend to integrate technology, people, and institutions, with dimensions of technology-mediated services, human infrastructure, and governance structures (4). Yet, the term \"smart city\" is also subject to rhetorical ambiguities, with some cities using the label to brand themselves without sufficient definition, revealing underlying self-congratulatory tendencies and hiding contradictory assumptions (5). Despite these challenges, the potential for smart cities to promote sustainable urban development and improve the urban landscape is significant, provided that urban policies are informed by a nuanced understanding of the interplay between these dimensions and the broader global context (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).",

DNA barcoding for identification of sand fly species (Diptera: Psychodidae) from leishmaniasis-endemic areas of Peru\nPhlebotomine sand flies are the only proven vectors of leishmaniases, a group of human and animal diseases. Accurate knowledge of sand fly species identification is essential in understanding the epidemiology of leishmaniasis and vector control in endemic areas. Classical identification of sand fly species based on morphological characteristics often remains difficult and requires taxonomic expertise. Here, we generated DNA barcodes of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene using 159 adult specimens morphologically identified to be 19 species of sand flies, belonging to 6 subgenera/species groups circulating in Peru, including the vector species. Neighbor-joining (NJ) analysis based on Kimura 2-Parameter genetic distances formed non-overlapping clusters for all species. The levels of intraspecific genetic divergence ranged from 0 to 5.96%, whereas interspecific genetic divergence among different species ranged from 8.39 to 19.08%. The generated COI barcodes could discriminate between all the sand fly taxa. Besides its success in separating known species, we found that DNA barcoding is useful in revealing population differentiation and cryptic diversity, and thus promises to be a valuable tool for epidemiological studies of leishmaniasis.

Analyzing Mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) Diversity in Pakistan by DNA Barcoding\nBackground Although they are important disease vectors mosquito biodiversity in Pakistan is poorly known. Recent epidemics of dengue fever have revealed the need for more detailed understanding of the diversity and distributions of mosquito species in this region. DNA barcoding improves the accuracy of mosquito inventories because morphological differences between many species are subtle, leading to misidentifications. Methodology/Principal Findings Sequence variation in the barcode region of the mitochondrial COI gene was used to identify mosquito species, reveal genetic diversity, and map the distribution of the dengue-vector species in Pakistan. Analysis of 1684 mosquitoes from 491 sites in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during 2010\u20132013 revealed 32 species with the assemblage dominated by Culex quinquefasciatus (61% of the collection). The genus Aedes (Stegomyia) comprised 15% of the specimens, and was represented by six taxa with the two dengue vector species, Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti, dominant and broadly distributed. Anopheles made up another 6% of the catch with An. subpictus dominating. Barcode sequence divergence in conspecific specimens ranged from 0\u20132.4%, while congeneric species showed from 2.3\u201317.8% divergence. A global haplotype analysis of disease-vectors showed the presence of multiple haplotypes, although a single haplotype of each dengue-vector species was dominant in most countries. Geographic distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus showed the later species was dominant and found in both rural and urban environments. Conclusions As the first DNA-based analysis of mosquitoes in Pakistan, this study has begun the construction of a barcode reference library for the mosquitoes of this region. Levels of genetic diversity varied among species. Because of its capacity to differentiate species, even those with subtle morphological differences, DNA barcoding aids accurate tracking of vector populations.\n\n3.

In order to assist in their identification, and to improve the taxonomy of this group, we constructed a reference dataset of 513 COI barcodes of 90 of the more common nominal species from Ghana, Togo, Benin and Nigeria (W Africa) and added ten publically available COI barcodes from nine nominal Afrotropical species to this (total: 523 COI barcodes; 98 nominal species; 26 genera). The identification accuracy of this dataset was evaluated with three methods (K2P distance-based, Neighbor-Joining (NJ) / Maximum Likelihood (ML) analysis, and using SpeciesIdentifier). Results of the three methods were highly congruent and showed a high identification success. Nine species pairs showed a low (< 0.03) mean interspecific K2P distance that resulted in several incorrect identifications. A high (> 0.03) maximum intraspecific K2P distance was observed in eight species and barcodes of these species not always formed single clusters in the NJ / ML analayses which may indicate the occurrence of cryptic species. Optimal K2P thresholds to differentiate intra- from interspecific K2P divergence were highly different among the three subfamilies (Eristalinae: 0.037, Syrphinae: 0.06, Microdontinae: 0.007\u20130.02), and among the different general suggesting that optimal thresholds are better defined at the genus level. In addition to providing an alternative identification tool, our study indicates that DNA barcoding improves the taxonomy of Afrotropical hoverflies by selecting (groups of) taxa that deserve further taxonomic study, and by attributing the unknown sex to species for which only one of the sexes is known.\n\n5. DNA barcoding of Neotropical black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae): Species identification and discovery of cryptic diversity in Mesoamerica\nAlthough correct taxonomy is paramount for disease control programs and epidemiological studies, morphology-based taxonomy of black flies is extremely difficult. In the present study, the utility of a partial sequence of the COI gene, the DNA barcoding region, for the identification of species of black flies from Mesoamerica was assessed. A total of 32 morphospecies were analyzed, one belonging to the genus Gigantodax and 31 species to the genus Simulium and six of its subgenera (Aspathia, Eusimulium, Notolepria, Psaroniocompsa, Psilopelmia, Trichodagmia). The Neighbour Joining tree (NJ) derived from the DNA barcodes grouped most specimens according to species or species groups recognized by morphotaxonomic studies. Intraspecific sequence divergences within morphologically distinct species ranged from 0.07% to 1.65%, while higher divergences (2.05%-6.13%) in species complexes suggested the presence of cryptic diversity. The existence of well-defined groups within S. callidum (Dyar & Shannon), S. quadrivittatum Loew, and S. samboni Jennings revealed the likely inclusion of cryptic species within these taxa. In addition, the suspected presence of sibling species within S. paynei Vargas and S. tarsatum Macquart was supported. DNA barcodes also showed that specimens of species that are difficult to delimit morphologically such as S. callidum, S. pseudocallidum D\u00edaz N\u00e1jera, S. travisi Vargas, Vargas & Ram\u00edrez-P\u00e9rez, relatives of the species complexes such as S. metallicum Bellardi s.l. (e.g., S. horacioi Okazawa & Onishi, S. jobbinsi Vargas, Mart\u00ednez Palacios, D\u00edaz N\u00e1jera, and S. puigi Vargas, Mart\u00ednez Palacios & D\u00edaz N\u00e1jera), and S. virgatum Coquillett complex (e.g., S. paynei and S. tarsatum) grouped together in the NJ analysis, suggesting they represent valid species. DNA barcoding combined with a sound morphotaxonomic framework provided an effective approach for the identification of medically important black flies species in Mesoamerica and for the discovery of hidden diversity within this group.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The methodologies employed across these studies demonstrate the robustness and versatility of DNA barcoding in cataloging biodiversity, particularly for species that are challenging to identify traditionally due to subtle morphological variations. In Peru, DNA barcoding using the COI gene proved effective in distinguishing between 19 species of sand flies, with sequence divergences allowing for the discernment of both intraspecific and interspecific differences (1). Similarly, in Pakistan, DNA barcoding of mosquitoes facilitated the identification of 32 species, revealing genetic diversity and helping to map the geographical distribution of disease-vector species (2). The construction of a barcode reference library for Pakistani mosquitoes laid the foundation for future studies focusing on vector populations and disease epidemiology. In West Africa, half of the European fruit fly species were barcoded, demonstrating the method's feasibility for molecular identification and aiding in the taxonomy of this group (3). The study on Afrotropical hoverflies further exemplified the utility of DNA barcoding, where barcodes differentiated between nominal species and suggested the presence of cryptic diversity, providing tools for both identification and taxonomic refinement (4). Lastly, in MesoAmerica, DNA barcoding not only supported species identification but also uncovered cryptic diversity within black fly species, highlighting the method's potential for enhancing our understanding of species complexes (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the transformative impact of DNA barcoding in biodiversity inventories, enabling more accurate species identification and uncovering hidden genetic diversity across various taxa.\n\n",

DNA barcoding for identification of sand fly species (Diptera: Psychodidae) from leishmaniasis-endemic areas of Peru\nPhlebotomine sand flies are the only proven vectors of leishmaniases, a group of human and animal diseases. Accurate knowledge of sand fly species identification is essential in understanding the epidemiology of leishmaniasis and vector control in endemic areas. Classical identification of sand fly species based on morphological characteristics often remains difficult and requires taxonomic expertise. Here, we generated DNA barcodes of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene using 159 adult specimens morphologically identified to be 19 species of sand flies, belonging to 6 subgenera/species groups circulating in Peru, including the vector species. Neighbor-joining (NJ) analysis based on Kimura 2-Parameter genetic distances formed non-overlapping clusters for all species. The levels of intraspecific genetic divergence ranged from 0 to 5.96%, whereas interspecific genetic divergence among different species ranged from 8.39 to 19.08%. The generated COI barcodes could discriminate between all the sand fly taxa. Besides its success in separating known species, we found that DNA barcoding is useful in revealing population differentiation and cryptic diversity, and thus promises to be a valuable tool for epidemiological studies of leishmaniasis.

Analyzing Mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) Diversity in Pakistan by DNA Barcoding\nBackground Although they are important disease vectors mosquito biodiversity in Pakistan is poorly known. Recent epidemics of dengue fever have revealed the need for more detailed understanding of the diversity and distributions of mosquito species in this region. DNA barcoding improves the accuracy of mosquito inventories because morphological differences between many species are subtle, leading to misidentifications. Methodology/Principal Findings Sequence variation in the barcode region of the mitochondrial COI gene was used to identify mosquito species, reveal genetic diversity, and map the distribution of the dengue-vector species in Pakistan. Analysis of 1684 mosquitoes from 491 sites in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during 2010\u20132013 revealed 32 species with the assemblage dominated by Culex quinquefasciatus (61% of the collection). The genus Aedes (Stegomyia) comprised 15% of the specimens, and was represented by six taxa with the two dengue vector species, Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti, dominant and broadly distributed. Anopheles made up another 6% of the catch with An. subpictus dominating. Barcode sequence divergence in conspecific specimens ranged from 0\u20132.4%, while congeneric species showed from 2.3\u201317.8% divergence. A global haplotype analysis of disease-vectors showed the presence of multiple haplotypes, although a single haplotype of each dengue-vector species was dominant in most countries. Geographic distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus showed the later species was dominant and found in both rural and urban environments. Conclusions As the first DNA-based analysis of mosquitoes in Pakistan, this study has begun the construction of a barcode reference library for the mosquitoes of this region. Levels of genetic diversity varied among species. Because of its capacity to differentiate species, even those with subtle morphological differences, DNA barcoding aids accurate tracking of vector populations.\n\n3.

        "inference": " The burgeoning field of DNA barcoding has significantly advanced biodiversity inventories, proving to be a pivotal tool for species identification and the revelation of cryptic diversity across various dipteran families. Studies have demonstrated the efficacy of COI barcodes in accurately discriminating between species, as seen in sand flies from Peru (1), mosquitoes from Pakistan (2), and various species from the Afrotropical region (4), where DNA barcoding not only facilitates species identification but also aids in taxonomic revisions due to the detection of inconsistencies in species boundaries (2, 4). Moreover, DNA barcoding has been instrumental in uncovering cryptic species complexes within black flies from Mesoamerica, highlighting the presence of hidden diversity that morphological taxonomy alone could not detect (5). This technique has been successfully applied across different geographic regions and taxa, including disease-relevant organisms like sand flies and mosquitoes, emphasizing its potential to enhance our understanding of epidemiological systems and vector control measures (1, 2). The integration of DNA barcoding into existing identification methods promises to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of biodiversity assessments, which is crucial for environments where biodiversity loss looms imminent (5).",

In addition to providing an alternative identification tool, our study indicates that DNA barcoding improves the taxonomy of Afrotropical hoverflies by selecting (groups of) taxa that deserve further taxonomic study, and by attributing the unknown sex to species for which only one of the sexes is known.\n\n5. DNA barcoding of Neotropical black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae): Species identification and discovery of cryptic diversity in Mesoamerica\nAlthough correct taxonomy is paramount for disease control programs and epidemiological studies, morphology-based taxonomy of black flies is extremely difficult. In the present study, the utility of a partial sequence of the COI gene, the DNA barcoding region, for the identification of species of black flies from Mesoamerica was assessed. A total of 32 morphospecies were analyzed, one belonging to the genus Gigantodax and 31 species to the genus Simulium and six of its subgenera (Aspathia, Eusimulium, Notolepria, Psaroniocompsa, Psilopelmia, Trichodagmia). The Neighbour Joining tree (NJ) derived from the DNA barcodes grouped most specimens according to species or species groups recognized by morphotaxonomic studies. Intraspecific sequence divergences within morphologically distinct species ranged from 0.07% to 1.65%, while higher divergences (2.05%-6.13%) in species complexes suggested the presence of cryptic diversity. The existence of well-defined groups within S. callidum (Dyar & Shannon), S. quadrivittatum Loew, and S. samboni Jennings revealed the likely inclusion of cryptic species within these taxa. In addition, the suspected presence of sibling species within S. paynei Vargas and S. tarsatum Macquart was supported. DNA barcodes also showed that specimens of species that are difficult to delimit morphologically such as S. callidum, S. pseudocallidum D\u00edaz N\u00e1jera, S. travisi Vargas, Vargas & Ram\u00edrez-P\u00e9rez, relatives of the species complexes such as S. metallicum Bellardi s.l. (e.g., S. horacioi Okazawa & Onishi, S. jobbinsi Vargas, Mart\u00ednez Palacios, D\u00edaz N\u00e1jera, and S. puigi Vargas, Mart\u00ednez Palacios & D\u00edaz N\u00e1jera), and S. virgatum Coquillett complex (e.g., S. paynei and S. tarsatum) grouped together in the NJ analysis, suggesting they represent valid species. DNA barcoding combined with a sound morphotaxonomic framework provided an effective approach for the identification of medically important black flies species in Mesoamerica and for the discovery of hidden diversity within this group.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In a study conducted in Peru, DNA barcoding was used to identify 19 species of sand flies morphologically identified and to discriminate between them, proving its utility for epidemiological studies of leishmaniasis (1). Similarly, in Pakistan, DNA barcoding of mosquitoes revealed 32 species, dominated by Culex quinquefasciatus, and provided insights into the genetic diversity and distribution of disease-vector species, highlighting the method's potential for tracking vector populations (2). The first DNA-based analysis of European fruit flies revealed a high identification accuracy, with barcoding able to differentiate between 50% of the 106 recognized species, suggesting its potential as a tool for species identification and management (3). In the Afrotropical region, a reference dataset of 513 COI barcodes from 90 nominal species of hoverflies was constructed, achieving high identification success and identifying cryptic species, thus supporting the use of DNA barcoding in species identification and taxonomic revisions (4). Lastly, in Mesoamerica, DNA barcoding of black flies demonstrated its efficacy in species identification, especially in species complexes, and revealed cryptic diversity, emphasizing its role in mediating taxonomy and epidemiological studies (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the effectiveness of DNA barcoding in biodiversity inventories, aiding in species identification, uncovering cryptic diversity, and informing disease vector control and management.",

Barcoding of biting midges in the genus Culicoides: a tool for species determination\nBiting midges of the genus Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are insect vectors of economically important veterinary diseases such as African horse sickness virus and bluetongue virus. However, the identification of Culicoides based on morphological features is difficult. The sequencing of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI), referred to as DNA barcoding, has been proposed as a tool for rapid identification to species. Hence, a study was undertaken to establish DNA barcodes for all morphologically determined Culicoides species in Swedish collections. In total, 237 specimens of Culicoides representing 37 morphologically distinct species were used. The barcoding generated 37 supported clusters, 31 of which were in agreement with the morphological determination. However, two pairs of closely related species could not be separated using the DNA barcode approach. Moreover, Culicoides obsoletus Meigen and Culicoides newsteadi Austen showed relatively deep intraspecific divergence (more than 10 times the average), which led to the creation of two cryptic species within each of C. obsoletus and C. newsteadi. The use of COI barcodes as a tool for the species identification of biting midges can differentiate 95% of species studied. Identification of some closely related species should employ a less conserved region, such as a ribosomal internal transcribed spacer.\n\n2. DNA barcodes reveal cryptic genetic diversity within the blackfly subgenus Trichodagmia Enderlein (Diptera: Simuliidae: Simulium) and related taxa in the New World\nIn this paper we investigate the utility of the COI DNA barcoding region for species identification and for revealing hidden diversity within the subgenus Trichodagmia and related taxa in the New World. In total, 24 morphospecies within the current expanded taxonomic concept of Trichodagmia were analyzed. Three species in the subgenus Aspathia and 10 species in the subgenus Simulium s.str. were also included in the analysis because of their putative phylogenetic relationship with Trichodagmia. In the Neighbour Joining analysis tree (NJ) derived from the DNA barcodes most of the specimens grouped together according to species or species groups as recognized by other morphotaxonomic studies. The interspecific genetic divergence averaged 11.2% (range 2.8\u201319.5%), whereas intraspecific genetic divergence within morphologically distinct species averaged 0.5% (range 0\u20131.2%). Higher values of genetic divergence (3.2\u20133.7%) in species complexes suggest the presence of cryptic diversity. The existence of well defined groups within S. piperi, S. duodenicornium, S. canadense and S. rostratum indicate the possible presence of cryptic species within these taxa. Also, the suspected presence of a sibling species in S. tarsatum and S. paynei is supported. DNA barcodes also showed that specimens from species that were taxonomically difficult to delimit such as S. hippovorum, S. rubrithorax, S. paynei, and other related taxa (S. solarii), grouped together in the NJ analysis, confirming the validity of their species status. The recovery of partial barcodes from specimens in collections was time consuming and PCR success was low from specimens more than 10 years old. However, when a sequence was obtained, it provided good resolution for species identification. Larvae preserved in \u2018weak\u2019 Carnoy\u2019s solution (9:1 ethanol:acetic acid) provided full DNA barcodes. Adding legs directly to the PCR mix from recently collected and preserved adults was an inexpensive, fast methodology to obtain full barcodes. In summary, DNA barcoding combined with a sound morphotaxonomic framework provides an effective approach for the delineation of species and for the discovery of hidden diversity in the subgenus Trichodagmia.\n\n3. Revision of Nearctic Dasysyrphus Enderlein (Diptera: Syrphidae)\nDasysyrphus Enderlein (Diptera: Syrphidae) has posed taxonomic challenges to researchers in the past, primarily due to their lack of interspecific diagnostic characters. In the present study, DNA data (mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase sub-unit I\u2014COI) were combined with morphology to help delimit species. This led to two species being resurrected from synonymy (D. laticaudus and D. pacificus) and the discovery of one new species (D. occidualis sp. nov.). An additional new species was described based on morphology alone (D. richardi sp. nov.), as the specimens were too old to obtain COI. Part of the taxonomic challenge presented by this group arises from missing type specimens. Neotypes are designated here for D. pauxillus and D. pinastri to bring stability to these names. An illustrated key to 13 Nearctic species is presented, along with descriptions, maps and supplementary data. A phylogeny based on COI is also presented and discussed.\n\n4. DNA barcodes for species delimitation in Chironomidae (Diptera): a case study on the genus Labrundinia\nAbstractIn this study, we analysed the applicability of DNA barcodes for delimitation of 79 specimens of 13 species of nonbiting midges in the subfamily Tanypodinae (Diptera: Chironomidae) from S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil. Our results support DNA barcoding as an excellent tool for species identification and for solving taxonomic conflicts in genusLabrundinia.Molecular analysis of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene sequences yielded taxon identification trees, supporting 13 cohesive species clusters, of which three similar groups were subsequently linked to morphological variation at the larval and pupal stage. Additionally, another cluster previously described by means of morphology was linked to molecular markers. We found a distinct barcode gap, and in some species substantial interspecific pairwise divergences (up to 19.3%) were observed, which permitted identification of all analysed species. The results also indicated that barcodes can be used to associate life stages of chironomids since COI was easily amplified and sequenced from different life stages with universal barcode primers.\n\n5. Identifying the Main Mosquito Species in China Based on DNA Barcoding\nMosquitoes are insects of the Diptera, Nematocera, and Culicidae families, some species of which are important disease vectors. Identifying mosquito species based on morphological characteristics is difficult, particularly the identification of specimens collected in the field as part of disease surveillance programs. Because of this difficulty, we constructed DNA barcodes of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, the COI gene, for the more common mosquito species in China, including the major disease vectors. A total of 404 mosquito specimens were collected and assigned to 15 genera and 122 species and subspecies on the basis of morphological characteristics. Individuals of the same species grouped closely together in a Neighborhood-Joining tree based on COI sequence similarity, regardless of collection site. COI gene sequence divergence was approximately 30 times higher for species in the same genus than for members of the same species. Divergence in over 98% of congeneric species ranged from 2.3% to 21.8%, whereas divergence in conspecific individuals ranged from 0% to 1.67%. Cryptic species may be common and a few pseudogenes were detected.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The methodologies employed across the five studies demonstrate the utility of DNA barcoding, specifically the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene, for species identification and the revelation of cryptic diversity within various dipteran groups. In the genus Culicoides, DNA barcoding successfully differentiated 95% of species, with some closely related species remaining un distinguishable, suggesting the need for testing other genetic regions for better species discrimination (1). Similarly, in the subgenus Trichodagmia, COI barcoding facilitated species identification and the discovery of cryptic species complexes, with the method's effectiveness supported by the close grouping of species in Neighborhood Joining analysis and the presence of higher genetic divergence in species that were morphologically challenging to distinguish (2). The revision of Dasysyrphus, which utilized both morphological and molecular data, including COI, led to the resolution of taxonomic challenges and the recognition of new species, underscoring the complementary nature of traditional taxonomy and DNA barcoding (3). In the Chironomidae, DNA barcoding not only facilitated species identification and the resolution of taxonomic conflicts, but also allowed for the association of life stages, with the method providing distinct barcode gaps and significant interspecific divergences (4). Lastly, in the identification of Chinese mosquito species, DNA barcoding of the COI gene clustered individuals closely based on species, with divergence between congeneric species being far greater than within species, indicating the method's sensitivity for detecting both deep intraspecific and shallow interspecific divergence (5). Collectively, these studies highlight the power of DNA barcoding in enhancing biodiversity inventories, providing a tools for species delimitation and revealing hidden genetic diversity within dipteran insects.",

Cryptic species may be common and a few pseudogenes were detected.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The burgeoning field of DNA barcoding has revolutionized biodiversity inventories, offering a powerful tool for species identification and the revelation of cryptic genetic diversity across various insect taxa. Studies on biting midges (1), blackflies (2), and syrphs (3) have demonstrated the efficacy of COI barcoding in resolving species complexities, with high success rates in species delimitation and the detection of new cryptic taxa. In the case of Chinese mosquitoes (5), DNA barcoding not only facilitates the identification of disease-vector species but also underscores the potential for barcode-based monitoring programs in disease control. These findings are echoed in the work with Chironomidae (4), where DNA barcodes have proven to be an excellent tool for species identification and the resolution of taxonomic conflicts. Collectively, these studies (1-5) showcase the utility of DNA barcoding in enhancing our understanding of species diversity and distribution, with implications for ecological surveys and disease management.",

Barcoding of biting midges in the genus Culicoides: a tool for species determination\nBiting midges of the genus Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are insect vectors of economically important veterinary diseases such as African horse sickness virus and bluetongue virus. However, the identification of Culicoides based on morphological features is difficult. The sequencing of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI), referred to as DNA barcoding, has been proposed as a tool for rapid identification to species. Hence, a study was undertaken to establish DNA barcodes for all morphologically determined Culicoides species in Swedish collections. In total, 237 specimens of Culicoides representing 37 morphologically distinct species were used. The barcoding generated 37 supported clusters, 31 of which were in agreement with the morphological determination. However, two pairs of closely related species could not be separated using the DNA barcode approach. Moreover, Culicoides obsoletus Meigen and Culicoides newsteadi Austen showed relatively deep intraspecific divergence (more than 10 times the average), which led to the creation of two cryptic species within each of C. obsoletus and C. newsteadi. The use of COI barcodes as a tool for the species identification of biting midges can differentiate 95% of species studied. Identification of some closely related species should employ a less conserved region, such as a ribosomal internal transcribed spacer.\n\n2. DNA barcodes reveal cryptic genetic diversity within the blackfly subgenus Trichodagmia Enderlein (Diptera: Simuliidae: Simulium) and related taxa in the New World\nIn this paper we investigate the utility of the COI DNA barcoding region for species identification and for revealing hidden diversity within the subgenus Trichodagmia and related taxa in the New World. In total, 24 morphospecies within the current expanded taxonomic concept of Trichodagmia were analyzed. Three species in the subgenus Aspathia and 10 species in the subgenus Simulium s.str. were also included in the analysis because of their putative phylogenetic relationship with Trichodagmia. In the Neighbour Joining analysis tree (NJ) derived from the DNA barcodes most of the specimens grouped together according to species or species groups as recognized by other morphotaxonomic studies. The interspecific genetic divergence averaged 11.2% (range 2.8\u201319.5%), whereas intraspecific genetic divergence within morphologically distinct species averaged 0.5% (range 0\u20131.2%). Higher values of genetic divergence (3.2\u20133.7%) in species complexes suggest the presence of cryptic diversity. The existence of well defined groups within S. piperi, S. duodenicornium, S. canadense and S. rostratum indicate the possible presence of cryptic species within these taxa. Also, the suspected presence of a sibling species in S. tarsatum and S. paynei is supported. DNA barcodes also showed that specimens from species that were taxonomically difficult to delimit such as S. hippovorum, S. rubrithorax, S. paynei, and other related taxa (S. solarii), grouped together in the NJ analysis, confirming the validity of their species status. The recovery of partial barcodes from specimens in collections was time consuming and PCR success was low from specimens more than 10 years old. However, when a sequence was obtained, it provided good resolution for species identification. Larvae preserved in \u2018weak\u2019 Carnoy\u2019s solution (9:1 ethanol:acetic acid) provided full DNA barcodes. Adding legs directly to the PCR mix from recently collected and preserved adults was an inexpensive, fast methodology to obtain full barcodes. In summary, DNA barcoding combined with a sound morphotaxonomic framework provides an effective approach for the delineation of species and for the discovery of hidden diversity in the subgenus Trichodagmia.\n\n3. Revision of Nearctic Dasysyrphus Enderlein (Diptera: Syrphidae)\nDasysyrphus Enderlein (Diptera: Syrphidae) has posed taxonomic challenges to researchers in the past, primarily due to their lack of interspecific diagnostic characters. In the present study, DNA data (mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase sub-unit I\u2014COI) were combined with morphology to help delimit species. This led to two species being resurrected from synonymy (D. laticaudus and D. pacificus) and the discovery of one new species (D. occidualis sp. nov.). An additional new species was described based on morphology alone (D. richardi sp. nov.), as the specimens were too old to obtain COI. Part of the taxonomic challenge presented by this group arises from missing type specimens. Neotypes are designated here for D. pauxillus and D. pinastri to bring stability to these names. An illustrated key to 13 Nearctic species is presented, along with descriptions, maps and supplementary data. A phylogeny based on COI is also presented and discussed.\n\n4. DNA barcodes for species delimitation in Chironomidae (Diptera): a case study on the genus Labrundinia\nAbstractIn this study, we analysed the applicability of DNA barcodes for delimitation of 79 specimens of 13 species of nonbiting midges in the subfamily Tanypodinae (Diptera: Chironomidae) from S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil. Our results support DNA barcoding as an excellent tool for species identification and for solving taxonomic conflicts in genusLabrundinia.Molecular analysis of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene sequences yielded taxon identification trees, supporting 13 cohesive species clusters, of which three similar groups were subsequently linked to morphological variation at the larval and pupal stage. Additionally, another cluster previously described by means of morphology was linked to molecular markers. We found a distinct barcode gap, and in some species substantial interspecific pairwise divergences (up to 19.3%) were observed, which permitted identification of all analysed species. The results also indicated that barcodes can be used to associate life stages of chironomids since COI was easily amplified and sequenced from different life stages with universal barcode primers.\n\n5. Identifying the Main Mosquito Species in China Based on DNA Barcoding\nMosquitoes are insects of the Diptera, Nematocera, and Culicidae families, some species of which are important disease vectors. Identifying mosquito species based on morphological characteristics is difficult, particularly the identification of specimens collected in the field as part of disease surveillance programs. Because of this difficulty, we constructed DNA barcodes of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, the COI gene, for the more common mosquito species in China, including the major disease vectors. A total of 404 mosquito specimens were collected and assigned to 15 genera and 122 species and subspecies on the basis of morphological characteristics. Individuals of the same species grouped closely together in a Neighborhood-Joining tree based on COI sequence similarity, regardless of collection site. COI gene sequence divergence was approximately 30 times higher for species in the same genus than for members of the same species. Divergence in over 98% of congeneric species ranged from 2.3% to 21.8%, whereas divergence in conspecific individuals ranged from 0% to 1.67%. Cryptic species may be common and a few pseudogenes were detected.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of biodiversity inventories, DNA-based tools have emerged as a game-changer, particularly in the identification of species that often remain elusive due to their morphological similarity. A study on the biting middges of the genus Culicoides demonstrated the efficacy of DNA barcoding in species determination, with a high success rate in distinguishing 37 out of 37 morphologically distinct species, albeit challenging in distinguishing closely related species (1). Similarly, DNA barcoding revealed significant cryptic genetic diversity within the blackfly subgenus Trichodagmia, with the technique corroborating species status and uncovering potential cryptic species complexes (2). In the case of the syrphid flies, a revised taxonomy of 13 Nearctic species was achieved through a combination of morphological and molecular data, with the introduction of two new species and the resolution of synonymy issues (3). A study on the nonbiting midges of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, used DNA barcoding to delimit 13 species clusters, with substantial interspecific divergences facilitating species identification and the resolution of taxonomic conflicts (4). Lastly, DNA barcoding was pivotal in identifying over 120 mosquito species in China, with specimens grouping closely together in Neighborhood-Joining trees, thereby aiding in disease surveillance programs (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the transformative impact of DNA-based tools in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of biodiversity inventories.",

E-governance competence: a framework\nWhile there is abundance of research on e-governance readiness and convergence, there is lack of research and theoretical understanding of competencies that governments must have to develop and deploy effective e-services and ensure usage of the deployed e-services in a manner that leads to effective e-governance. In this research, we draw from business/IT alignment framework, innovation literature, and coordination theory and propose a framework of e-governance competence that highlights the importance of technical and administrative alignment capability at strategic and operational levels for effective e-governance. We validate the proposed model in the context of immigration-related e-services provided by the Hong Kong SAR, P.R.C. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed.\n\n2. Government chief information officer (GCIO) ontology: a tool to formalize the GCIO function\nInformation Technology (IT) leadership is essential for the successful utilization of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in any organizational context. In particular, IT leadership is a critical success factor for every Electronic Government (e-Government) initiative. Most of the leading countries in e-Government development have adopted the Chief Information Officer (GCIO) function to lead and coordinate their technology-related projects. In addition, most influential international e-Government rankings -- like those conducted by United Nations and Waseda University; include the presence of the function in their assessment criteria. However, the adoption of the function entails broader actions than the merely establishment of the position itself. Several prerequisites, such as qualified human resources, coordination and collaboration capabilities, and governance mechanisms, among others, need to be available in government for the proper establishment and sustainability of the function. Despite its broader adoption in practice, there is scarce literature to assist governments in understanding the complexities of the GCIO function and making the prerequisites available. This paper presents the development of ontology to formally define the GCIO function. The main contribution of this work is to offer a tool for sharing and reusing the existing knowledge in the GCIO domain, filling the research-practice gap identified above.\n\n3. Identifying government chief information officer education and training needs: the case of Saudi Arabia\nThis paper identifies education and training needs of Government Chief Information Officers (GCIO) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). It aims to provide foundation that would assist the KSA national e-Government program (YESSER) in identifying and prioritizing initiatives oriented towards building the capacity of GCIOs. Based on the results of a survey conducted among GCIOs and highest IT officials of 30 government agencies and the results of four semi-structured interviews, the paper identifies the knowledge areas and skills that should be developed by GCIO educational programs, the stages of public sector ICT in which GCIOs are most involved, the preferred delivery modes for the training, the preferred institutions for hosting GCIOs education and training programs, and the prerequisites for those who should participate in GCIO educational programs. In addition to the policy recommendations for the KSA Government, the main contribution of the paper is the validation of a methodology that can be applied by any government for designing capacity-building programs for their IT leaders.\n\n4. Competency Requirements for Transformational E-Government\nOne key aspect of e-government is its potential for an ICT enabled transformation of the public sector. Through ICT, new forms of collaboration and inter-organizational public service networks become feasible, making it possible to carry out the public sector's tasks more efficiently and effectively. However, a rather significant gap exists between this transformational potential and the tangible results that have been achieved so far. One reason for this slow and cumbersome implementation seems to be that public managers lack the necessary competencies to bring the promises of e-government to fruition. This article analyzes the changing competency requirements for public managers that accompany e-government and describes the first steps in the development of an e-government competency framework for public managers. The article sums up the results of a literature review on e-government competencies, a survey carried out for the article, and data gathered in focus group workshops. Based on these results, a first set of e-government competencies is then outlined that goes beyond pure ICT skills. The article concludes with a discussion of the framework and its implications for human resource management in the public sector.\n\n5. Collaborative Leadership Development For Local Government Officials: Exploring Competencies and Program Impact\nINTRODUCTION One hundred years after Frederick Taylor's seminal work, The Principles of Scientific Management (1911), it is worthwhile to observe how much the concept of leadership has evolved. Core themes of motivation, performance, and human interaction have developed and become more sophisticated (Yukl, 2010). \"Great man\" or \"trait\" theories have been replaced by more complex, interactive theories of leadership. However, the traditional notion of leadership focusing on hierarchical leaders and followers remains dominant in popular conceptions of leadership and in programs that seek to develop leaders. What characterized leadership in 20th-century organizations shaped by Taylor's scientific management paradigm contrasts with emerging, contemporary organizational priorities of the 21st century. Today's leadership context, particularly in the public sector, is interorganizational. In public administration in particular, this shift corresponds with an emerging collaborative governance paradigm that is reorienting the field away from a focus on hierarchy, toward a focus on networks and partnerships that cross traditional boundaries (Emerson, Nabatchi & Balogh, 2012). This new focus highlights the need to develop leadership competencies that extend beyond traditional, hierarchical, managerial functions (Morse, 2008; Sullivan, Williams & Jeffares, 2012). While it is important to understand how the definition of leadership has transformed over time, it is equally important to consider the connected task of developing leaders. Iles and Preece (2006) highlighted this need by noting that public leadership development programs must expand their efforts to build the competencies that create value both within organizations and beyond. Considering how these competencies align with leadership training components is necessary to assess training gaps and opportunities for improvement. The transition from leading within organizations to leading beyond them places new demands on leadership development programs. Drawing upon the growing body of literature on collaborative competencies, as well as the literature on leadership development, along with experiences and data from two local government leadership development programs, this article addresses the call to develop leaders who can achieve results both within traditional organizational structures and also across organizational and sectoral boundaries. This article utilizes program-specific information to offer insights and respond to the question presented in Getha-Taylor, Holmes, Jacobson, Morse and Sowa (2011, p. i92): \"Which programs, strategies, and curricula are most appropriate to build and nurture leadership skills for public leadership 'across boundaries'?\" To this end, three related questions of interest are explored: 1) What additional leadership competencies are required of local government managers for collaborative governance? 2) Which programmatic components are best suited to develop collaborative competencies? 3) What are the most appropriate methods to evaluate the expected outcomes of collaborative leadership development programs? The article is organized accordingly. First, we review literature on collaborative leadership and collaborative competencies and examine arguments calling for the development of those competencies in public leaders. Next, we consider how training curricula should adapt to develop collaborative competency development. We present insights from local government executive development programs in North Carolina and Kansas and examine data collected from program participants to consider which programmatic components are best suited to develop collaborative leadership competencies. We then turn to the question of how to evaluate program impact on collaborative competency, again utilizing data from the two programs being studied. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the implications of this research and offer advice for others engaged in training public sector executives. \u2026\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In exploring e-government competence, the methodologies employed across the five studies reveal a multifaceted approach to understanding the skills and capabilities required for effective public sector ICT leadership and management. The first study (1) utilizes a framework derived from business/IT alignment and innovation literature, along with coordination theory, to propose a e-governance competence framework, which is validated through immigration-related e-services in Hong Kong. This framework emphasizes the importance of technical and administrative alignment at strategic and operational levels. The second paper (2) contributes to the field by developing an ontology to formally define the Government Chief Information Officer (GCIO) function, focusing on the need for qualified human resources, coordination, and collaboration capabilities, among others, for the effective establishment and sustainability of the GCIO role. The third study (3) employs a survey and semi-structured interviews to identify knowledge areas and skills for GCIO educational programs, aiming to provide a foundation for the KSA national e-Government program's capacity-building initiatives. The fourth paper (4) analyzes the competency requirements for transformational e-government, summarizing literature on e-government competencies and surveying public managers to outline a first set of e-government competencies, emphasizing the need for skills beyond pure ICT. Lastly, the fifth study (5) explores collaborative leadership development for local government officials, utilizing program-specific data to evaluate the impact of leadership development programs on collaborative competencies, highlighting the necessity for curriculum adaptation to develop these skills in the context of collaborative governance. Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of empirical validation, ontological development, qualitative data analysis, and programmatic adaptation to address the evolving demands of e-government competence.",

E-governance competence: a framework\nWhile there is abundance of research on e-governance readiness and convergence, there is lack of research and theoretical understanding of competencies that governments must have to develop and deploy effective e-services and ensure usage of the deployed e-services in a manner that leads to effective e-governance. In this research, we draw from business/IT alignment framework, innovation literature, and coordination theory and propose a framework of e-governance competence that highlights the importance of technical and administrative alignment capability at strategic and operational levels for effective e-governance. We validate the proposed model in the context of immigration-related e-services provided by the Hong Kong SAR, P.R.C. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed.\n\n2. Government chief information officer (GCIO) ontology: a tool to formalize the GCIO function\nInformation Technology (IT) leadership is essential for the successful utilization of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in any organizational context. In particular, IT leadership is a critical success factor for every Electronic Government (e-Government) initiative. Most of the leading countries in e-Government development have adopted the Chief Information Officer (GCIO) function to lead and coordinate their technology-related projects. In addition, most influential international e-Government rankings -- like those conducted by United Nations and Waseda University; include the presence of the function in their assessment criteria. However, the adoption of the function entails broader actions than the merely establishment of the position itself. Several prerequisites, such as qualified human resources, coordination and collaboration capabilities, and governance mechanisms, among others, need to be available in government for the proper establishment and sustainability of the function. Despite its broader adoption in practice, there is scarce literature to assist governments in understanding the complexities of the GCIO function and making the prerequisites available. This paper presents the development of ontology to formally define the GCIO function. The main contribution of this work is to offer a tool for sharing and reusing the existing knowledge in the GCIO domain, filling the research-practice gap identified above.\n\n3. Identifying government chief information officer education and training needs: the case of Saudi Arabia\nThis paper identifies education and training needs of Government Chief Information Officers (GCIO) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). It aims to provide foundation that would assist the KSA national e-Government program (YESSER) in identifying and prioritizing initiatives oriented towards building the capacity of GCIOs. Based on the results of a survey conducted among GCIOs and highest IT officials of 30 government agencies and the results of four semi-structured interviews, the paper identifies the knowledge areas and skills that should be developed by GCIO educational programs, the stages of public sector ICT in which GCIOs are most involved, the preferred delivery modes for the training, the preferred institutions for hosting GCIOs education and training programs, and the prerequisites for those who should participate in GCIO educational programs. In addition to the policy recommendations for the KSA Government, the main contribution of the paper is the validation of a methodology that can be applied by any government for designing capacity-building programs for their IT leaders.\n\n4. Competency Requirements for Transformational E-Government\nOne key aspect of e-government is its potential for an ICT enabled transformation of the public sector. Through ICT, new forms of collaboration and inter-organizational public service networks become feasible, making it possible to carry out the public sector's tasks more efficiently and effectively. However, a rather significant gap exists between this transformational potential and the tangible results that have been achieved so far. One reason for this slow and cumbersome implementation seems to be that public managers lack the necessary competencies to bring the promises of e-government to fruition. This article analyzes the changing competency requirements for public managers that accompany e-government and describes the first steps in the development of an e-government competency framework for public managers. The article sums up the results of a literature review on e-government competencies, a survey carried out for the article, and data gathered in focus group workshops. Based on these results, a first set of e-government competencies is then outlined that goes beyond pure ICT skills. The article concludes with a discussion of the framework and its implications for human resource management in the public sector.\n\n5. Collaborative Leadership Development For Local Government Officials: Exploring Competencies and Program Impact\nINTRODUCTION One hundred years after Frederick Taylor's seminal work, The Principles of Scientific Management (1911), it is worthwhile to observe how much the concept of leadership has evolved. Core themes of motivation, performance, and human interaction have developed and become more sophisticated (Yukl, 2010). \"Great man\" or \"trait\" theories have been replaced by more complex, interactive theories of leadership. However, the traditional notion of leadership focusing on hierarchical leaders and followers remains dominant in popular conceptions of leadership and in programs that seek to develop leaders. What characterized leadership in 20th-century organizations shaped by Taylor's scientific management paradigm contrasts with emerging, contemporary organizational priorities of the 21st century. Today's leadership context, particularly in the public sector, is interorganizational. In public administration in particular, this shift corresponds with an emerging collaborative governance paradigm that is reorienting the field away from a focus on hierarchy, toward a focus on networks and partnerships that cross traditional boundaries (Emerson, Nabatchi & Balogh, 2012). This new focus highlights the need to develop leadership competencies that extend beyond traditional, hierarchical, managerial functions (Morse, 2008; Sullivan, Williams & Jeffares, 2012). While it is important to understand how the definition of leadership has transformed over time, it is equally important to consider the connected task of developing leaders. Iles and Preece (2006) highlighted this need by noting that public leadership development programs must expand their efforts to build the competencies that create value both within organizations and beyond. Considering how these competencies align with leadership training components is necessary to assess training gaps and opportunities for improvement. The transition from leading within organizations to leading beyond them places new demands on leadership development programs. Drawing upon the growing body of literature on collaborative competencies, as well as the literature on leadership development, along with experiences and data from two local government leadership development programs, this article addresses the call to develop leaders who can achieve results both within traditional organizational structures and also across organizational and sectoral boundaries. This article utilizes program-specific information to offer insights and respond to the question presented in Getha-Taylor, Holmes, Jacobson, Morse and Sowa (2011, p. i92): \"Which programs, strategies, and curricula are most appropriate to build and nurture leadership skills for public leadership 'across boundaries'?\" To this end, three related questions of interest are explored: 1) What additional leadership competencies are required of local government managers for collaborative governance? 2) Which programmatic components are best suited to develop collaborative competencies? 3) What are the most appropriate methods to evaluate the expected outcomes of collaborative leadership development programs? The article is organized accordingly. First, we review literature on collaborative leadership and collaborative competencies and examine arguments calling for the development of those competencies in public leaders. Next, we consider how training curricula should adapt to develop collaborative competency development. We present insights from local government executive development programs in North Carolina and Kansas and examine data collected from program participants to consider which programmatic components are best suited to develop collaborative leadership competencies. We then turn to the question of how to evaluate program impact on collaborative competency, again utilizing data from the two programs being studied. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the implications of this research and offer advice for others engaged in training public sector executives. \u2026\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The burgeoning field of e-government necessitates a distinct set of competencies for public sector officials, which are fundamentally different from traditional leadership skills (1, 4). The development and implementation of e-government initiatives require not only a deep understanding of ICT but also a broader perspective that encompasses strategic and operational alignment at the government level (1). This is especially true for the role of Government Chief Information Officer (GCIO), which is pivotal for the successful adoption and integration of ICT in government systems, and its function is multifaceted, necessitating a range of knowledge areas and skills (2). Moreover, the transformative potential of e-government is rarely realized, as public managers lack the necessary competencies to capitalize on the promises of e-government, highlighting the need for a comprehensive e-government competency framework (4). As organizations shift towards collaborative governance, public sector officials must develop competencies that go beyond traditional managerial functions, embracing an interorganizational approach and value creation across sectors (5). The educational and training needs of GCIOs, in particular, must be addressed to ensure they are equipped with the knowledge and skills to navigate the complexities of e-government, including the identification and prioritization of initiatives that build their capacity (3). The development of these competencies is facilitated by programs that include both hardware and software skills as well as softer skills like strategic thinking, coordination, and collaboration, with the ultimate goal of achieving results within and beyond traditional organizational structures (5). The empirical validation of these themes through surveys and focus groups underscores the critical need for a cohesive and comprehensive approach to developing e-government competencies, which is essential for the effective realization of the transformative potential of ICT in the public sector (1, 3, 4, 5).\n\n",

Detection of invalid routing announcement in the Internet\nNetwork measurement has shown that a specific IP address prefix may be announced by more than one autonomous system (AS), a phenomenon commonly referred to as Multiple Origin AS, or MOAS. MOAS can be due to either operational need to support multi-homing, or false route announcements due to configuration or implementation errors, or even by intentional attacks. Packets following such bogus routes will be either dropped or in the case of an intentional attack, delivered to a machine of the attacker's choosing. The paper presents a protocol enhancement to BGP which enables BGP to detect bogus route announcements from false origins. Rather than imposing cryptography-based authentication and encryption to secure routing message exchanges, our solution makes use of the rich connectivity among ASs that exists in the Internet. Simulation results show that this simple solution can effectively detect false routing announcements even in the presence of multiple compromised routers, become more robust in larger topologies, and can substantially reduce the impact of false routing announcements even with a partial deployment.\n\n2. On interdomain routing security and pretty secure BGP (psBGP)\nIt is well known that the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), the IETF standard interdomain routing protocol, is vulnerable to a variety of attacks, and that a single misconfigured or malicious BGP speaker could result in large-scale service disruption. In this paper, we present             Pretty Secure BGP (psBGP)             ---a proposal for securing BGP, including an architectural overview, design details for significant aspects, and preliminary security and operational analysis. psBGP differs from other security proposals (e.g., S-BGP and soBGP) in that it makes use of a single-level PKI for AS number authentication, a decentralized trust model for verifying the propriety of IP prefix origin, and a rating-based stepwise approach for AS_PATH (integrity) verification. psBGP trades off the strong security guarantees of S-BGP for presumed-simpler operation, e.g., using a PKI with a simple structure, with a small number of certificate types, and of manageable size. psBGP is designed to successfully defend against various (nonmalicious and malicious) threats from uncoordinated BGP speakers, and to be incrementally deployed with incremental benefits.\n\n3. Origin authentication in interdomain routing\nAttacks against Internet routing are increasing in number and severity. Contributing greatly to these attacks is the absence of origin authentication: there is no way to validate claims of address ownership or location. The lack of such services enables not only attacks by malicious entities, but indirectly allow seemingly inconsequential miconfigurations to disrupt large portions of the Internet. This paper considers the semantics, design, and costs of origin authentication in interdomain routing. We formalize the semantics of address delegation and use on the Internet, and develop and characterize broad classes of origin authentication proof systems. We estimate the address delegation graph representing the current use of IPv4 address space using available routing data. This effort reveals that current address delegation is dense and relatively static: as few as 16 entities perform 80% of the delegation on the Internet. We conclude by evaluating the proposed services via traced based simulation. Our simulation shows the enhanced proof systems can reduce significantly reduce resource costs associated with origin authentication.\n\n4. Representation of IP Routing Policies in a Routing Registry (ripe-81++)\nThis document was originally published as a RIPE document known as ripe-181 but is also being published as an Informational RFC to reach a larger audience than its original scope. It has received community wide interest and acknowledgment throughout the Internet service provider community and will be used as the basic starting point for future work on Internet Routing Registries and routing policy representation. It can also be referred to as ripe-81++. This document is an update to the original `ripe-81'[1] proposal for representing and storing routing polices within the RIPE database. It incorporates several extensions proposed by Merit Inc.[2] and gives details of a generalized IP routing policy representation to be used by all Internet routing registries. It acts as both tutorial and provides details of database objects and attributes that use and make up a routing registry.\n\n5. Optimizing BGP security by exploiting path stability\nThe Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the de facto interdomain routing protocol on the Internet. While the serious vulnerabilities of BGP are well known, no security solution has been widely deployed. The lack of adoption is largely caused by a failure to find a balance between deployability, cost, and security. In this paper, we consider the design and performance of BGP path authentication constructions that limit resource costs by exploiting route stability. Based on a year-long study of BGP traffic and indirectly supported by findings within the networking community, we observe that routing paths are highly stable. This observation leads to comprehensive and efficient constructions for path authentication. We empirically analyze the resource consumption of the proposed constructions via trace-based simulations. This latter study indicates that our constructions can reduce validation costs by as much as 97.3% over existing proposals while requiring nominal storage resources. We conclude by considering operational issues related to incremental deployment of our solution.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The methodologies employed across the five papers to address BGP security converge on the principle of enhancing message validation and authentication through a combination of protocol enhancements, cryptographic techniques, and database-backed solutions. The first paper introduces a protocol enhancement that leverages the rich connectivity among ASs to detect false route announcements, eschewing cryptography-based authentication in favor of network resilience (1). The second paper proposes a PKI-based authentication system for AS numbers within BGP, complemented by rating-based verification of the AS_PATH, catering to a decentralized trust model and incremental deployment (2). Origin authentication is the focus of the third paper, which formalizes address delegation semantics and develops origin authentication proof systems, evaluating their performance through traced-based simulation (3). The fourth paper contributes to the issue by proposing a generalized IP routing policy representation within a routing registry, aiming to provide a clear tutorial on database objects and attributes for improved policy representation (4). Lastly, the fifth paper explores path stability to optimize BGP security, suggesting efficient path authentication constructions that minimize resource costs and validate at a reduced scale, emphasizing the importance of incremental deployment (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore a multi-faceted approach to fortifying BGP against attacks, balancing the need for robust security with practical considerations of deployment and performance.\n\n",

        "inference": " The challenge of securing BGP, the backbone of interdomain routing on the Internet, has been a focal point for research due to the protocol's vulnerability to both accidental and malicious misconfigurations. A recurring theme across studies is the need to balance security, simplification, and practicality in proposed solutions. One approach aims to detect false routing announcements by leveraging the rich connectivity among autonomous systems (AS), utilizing simulation results to demonstrate its effectiveness in various deployment scenarios (1). Another proposition, Pretty Secure BGP (psBGP), introduces a single-level Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for AS number authentication and a rating-based approach for AS_PATH verification, striking a balance between strong security guarantees and operational simplicity (2). Origin authentication, which is essential for preventing both direct and indirect routing disruptions, is also highlighted as a critical aspect of interdomain routing security, with research focusing on developing broad classes of authentication proof systems that are computationally efficient (3). The ripe-81++ document contributes by providing a detailed representation of IP routing policies within a routing registry, which is instrumental for future work on infrastructure-level routing security (4). Lastly, exploiting path stability is proposed as a method to optimize BGP security, with the notion that paths are highly stable, leading to efficient path authentication constructions with minimal resource costs (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the importance of integrating security measures into the fabric of BGP while considering the protocol's operational complexity and the need for incremental, robust solutions.\n\n",

In this paper, we consider the design and performance of BGP path authentication constructions that limit resource costs by exploiting route stability. Based on a year-long study of BGP traffic and indirectly supported by findings within the networking community, we observe that routing paths are highly stable. This observation leads to comprehensive and efficient constructions for path authentication. We empirically analyze the resource consumption of the proposed constructions via trace-based simulations. This latter study indicates that our constructions can reduce validation costs by as much as 97.3% over existing proposals while requiring nominal storage resources. We conclude by considering operational issues related to incremental deployment of our solution.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In addressing the critical issue of BGP security, various research efforts have proposed distinct solutions to enhance the protocol's resilience against attacks and misconfigurations. The first paper introduces a protocol enhancement for BGP that utilizes the rich connectivity among autonomous systems (AS) to detect false route announcements, focusing on identifying multiple origin AS issues without relying on cryptography-based authentication and encryption (1). The second paper builds upon this by introducing Pretty Secure BGP (psBGP), which offers a single-level PKI for AS number authentication and a rating-based stepwise approach for AS_PATH verification, aiming to provide incremental security benefits with a simpler operational model (2). The third paper delves into origin authentication in interdomain routing, formalizing the semantics of address delegation and developing origin authentication proof systems, highlighting the need for such services to reduce resource costs and stabilize the Internet (3). The fourth paper contributes to the issue by recommending a representation of IP routing policies in a routing registry, providing a generalized IP routing policy representation that can serve as a foundation for future work on Internet Routing Registries and routing policy representation (4). Lastly, the fifth paper focuses on optimizing BGP security by exploiting path stability, proposing path authentication constructions that minimize resource costs while maintaining a high level of security, supported by empirical simulations that demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solutions (5). Together, these studies underscore the multifaceted approach to addressing BGP security, balancing the need for robust defense mechanisms with practical considerations for deployment and scalability.\n\n",

Ontology-driven approach for describing industrial socio-cyberphysical systems\u2019 components\nNowadays, the concept of the industrial Internet of things is considered by researchers as the basis of Industry 4.0. Its use is aimed at creating a single information space that allows to unite all the components of production, starting from the processed raw materials to the interaction with suppliers and users of completed goods. Such a union will allow to change the established business processes of production to increase the customization of end products for the consumer and to reduce the costs for its producers. Each of the components is described using a digital twin, showing their main characteristics, important for production. The heterogeneity of these characteristics for each of the production levels makes it very difficult to exchange information between them. To solve the problem of interaction between individual components this paper proposes to use the ontological approach to model the components of industrial socio-cyberphysical systems. The paper considers four scenarios of interaction in the industrial Internet of things, based on which the upper-level ontology is formed, which describes the main components of industrial socio-cyberphysical systems and the connections between them.\n\n2. Monitoring and Automating Factories Using Semantic Models\nKeeping factories running at any time is a critical task for every manufacturing enterprise. Optimizing the flows of goods and services inside and between factories is a challenge that attracts much attention in research and business. The idea to fully describe a factory in a digital form to improve decision making is called a virtual factory. While promising virtual factory frameworks have been proposed, their semantic models lack depth and suffer from limited expressiveness. We propose an enhanced semantic model of a factory, which enables views spanning from the high level of supply chains to the low level of machines on the shop floor. The model includes a mapping to relational production databases to support federated queries on different legacy systems in use. We evaluate the model in a production line use case, demonstrating that it can be used for typical factory tasks, such as assembly line identification or machine availability checks\n\n3. Resilient Ontology Support Facilitating Multi-Perspective Process Integration in Industry 4.0\nA major challenge for Industry 4.0 organizations is the mutual alignment of automation and information technology while increasing effectiveness and agility of processes. From a technological view, it requires architectures and systems coupling heterogeneous technologies, from an operations perspective, it requires context-sensitive representations. Ontologies do not only support alignment, but also integration and development processes. For the introduced ontology we utilize the multi-perspective RAMI4.0 framework, as it provides several layers and perspectives, including production and business processes. We suggest using Subject-oriented Business Process Management (S-BPM) models to represent executable processes, as they allow encapsulating industry standard-conform as well as stakeholder behavior. Thereby, the ontology backs perspective specific knowledge, and can be adapted as semantic baseline in a flexible way.\n\n4. ExtruOnt: An ontology for describing a\u00a0type\u00a0of manufacturing machine for\u00a0Industry\u00a04.0\u00a0systems\nSemantically rich descriptions of manufacturing machines, offered in a machine-interpretable code, can provide interesting benefits in Industry 4.0 scenarios. However, the lack of that type of descriptions is evident. In this paper we present the development effort made to build an ontology, called ExtruOnt, for describing a type of manufacturing machine, more precisely, a type that performs an extrusion process (extruder). Although the scope of the ontology is restricted to a concrete domain, it could be used as a model for the development of other ontologies for describing manufacturing machines in Industry 4.0 scenarios. The terms of the ExtruOnt ontology provide different types of information related with an extruder, which are reflected in distinct modules that constitute the ontology. Thus, it contains classes and properties for expressing descriptions about components of an extruder, spatial connections, features, and 3D representations of those components, and finally the sensors used to capture indicators about the performance of this type of machine. The ontology development process has been carried out in close collaboration with domain experts.\n\n5. An ISA-95 based Ontology for Manufacturing Systems Knowledge Description Extended with Semantic Rules\nThere is a trend about the adoption of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning formalisms, such as ontologies, for industrial automation. For example, semantic models are used as knowledge bases that encapsulate different type of information of manufacturing systems, e.g., statuses and capabilities of their cyber and physical resources. Moreover, these models can be updated and accessed during runtime. In this context, models are becoming a critical part of the system infrastructure for both controlling and monitoring activities. However, models tend to be designed for specific purposes and not standardized. This is an issue because the employed formalisms, such as ontologies, emerged in order to bring an engineering tool for commonly classifying, defining, and sharing information. This article proposes the development of modular ontologies based on different parts of the ISA-95 standard for describing the product, process, and resource information of manufacturing systems. In addition, this research work demonstrates a set of semantic rules that may be used for inferring implicit knowledge of the ontology that permits the automatic checking of the required machines to manufacture different product variants.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In exploring the role of semantic IoT in industry, researchers have employed various methodologies to enhance the interoperability and efficiency of industrial systems. An ontology-driven approach has been proposed to model the digital twin of industrial socio-cyberphysical systems, focusing on the interaction between diverse components through a multi-layered ontology that captures their unique characteristics (1). Similarly, an enhanced semantic model has been developed for factories, incorporating a multi-perspective RAMI4.0 framework and subject-oriented business process management models to facilitate the integration and development of industrial processes (2). The resilient ontology support approach suggests utilizing the multi-perspective RAMI4.0 framework and subject-oriented Business Process Management (S-BPM) models to align automation and information technology, making it flexible and context-sensitive (3). Additionally, the ExtruOnt ontology development effort focuses on a specific manufacturing machine, creating a machine-interpretable description that captures the machine's components, spatial connections, features, and performance indicators, with input from domain experts (4). Lastly, an ISA-95 based ontology has been developed, extended with semantic rules to provide a knowledge base for manufacturing systems, enabling the automatic checking of required machines for different product variants (5). These methodologies collectively emphasize the importance of standardized semantic models, which can be dynamically updated and applied to various industrial scenarios to improve efficiency and adaptability.\n\n",

Ontology-driven approach for describing industrial socio-cyberphysical systems\u2019 components\nNowadays, the concept of the industrial Internet of things is considered by researchers as the basis of Industry 4.0. Its use is aimed at creating a single information space that allows to unite all the components of production, starting from the processed raw materials to the interaction with suppliers and users of completed goods. Such a union will allow to change the established business processes of production to increase the customization of end products for the consumer and to reduce the costs for its producers. Each of the components is described using a digital twin, showing their main characteristics, important for production. The heterogeneity of these characteristics for each of the production levels makes it very difficult to exchange information between them. To solve the problem of interaction between individual components this paper proposes to use the ontological approach to model the components of industrial socio-cyberphysical systems. The paper considers four scenarios of interaction in the industrial Internet of things, based on which the upper-level ontology is formed, which describes the main components of industrial socio-cyberphysical systems and the connections between them.\n\n2. Monitoring and Automating Factories Using Semantic Models\nKeeping factories running at any time is a critical task for every manufacturing enterprise. Optimizing the flows of goods and services inside and between factories is a challenge that attracts much attention in research and business. The idea to fully describe a factory in a digital form to improve decision making is called a virtual factory. While promising virtual factory frameworks have been proposed, their semantic models lack depth and suffer from limited expressiveness. We propose an enhanced semantic model of a factory, which enables views spanning from the high level of supply chains to the low level of machines on the shop floor. The model includes a mapping to relational production databases to support federated queries on different legacy systems in use. We evaluate the model in a production line use case, demonstrating that it can be used for typical factory tasks, such as assembly line identification or machine availability checks\n\n3. Resilient Ontology Support Facilitating Multi-Perspective Process Integration in Industry 4.0\nA major challenge for Industry 4.0 organizations is the mutual alignment of automation and information technology while increasing effectiveness and agility of processes. From a technological view, it requires architectures and systems coupling heterogeneous technologies, from an operations perspective, it requires context-sensitive representations. Ontologies do not only support alignment, but also integration and development processes. For the introduced ontology we utilize the multi-perspective RAMI4.0 framework, as it provides several layers and perspectives, including production and business processes. We suggest using Subject-oriented Business Process Management (S-BPM) models to represent executable processes, as they allow encapsulating industry standard-conform as well as stakeholder behavior. Thereby, the ontology backs perspective specific knowledge, and can be adapted as semantic baseline in a flexible way.\n\n4. ExtruOnt: An ontology for describing a\u00a0type\u00a0of manufacturing machine for\u00a0Industry\u00a04.0\u00a0systems\nSemantically rich descriptions of manufacturing machines, offered in a machine-interpretable code, can provide interesting benefits in Industry 4.0 scenarios. However, the lack of that type of descriptions is evident. In this paper we present the development effort made to build an ontology, called ExtruOnt, for describing a type of manufacturing machine, more precisely, a type that performs an extrusion process (extruder). Although the scope of the ontology is restricted to a concrete domain, it could be used as a model for the development of other ontologies for describing manufacturing machines in Industry 4.0 scenarios. The terms of the ExtruOnt ontology provide different types of information related with an extruder, which are reflected in distinct modules that constitute the ontology. Thus, it contains classes and properties for expressing descriptions about components of an extruder, spatial connections, features, and 3D representations of those components, and finally the sensors used to capture indicators about the performance of this type of machine. The ontology development process has been carried out in close collaboration with domain experts.\n\n5. An ISA-95 based Ontology for Manufacturing Systems Knowledge Description Extended with Semantic Rules\nThere is a trend about the adoption of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning formalisms, such as ontologies, for industrial automation. For example, semantic models are used as knowledge bases that encapsulate different type of information of manufacturing systems, e.g., statuses and capabilities of their cyber and physical resources. Moreover, these models can be updated and accessed during runtime. In this context, models are becoming a critical part of the system infrastructure for both controlling and monitoring activities. However, models tend to be designed for specific purposes and not standardized. This is an issue because the employed formalisms, such as ontologies, emerged in order to bring an engineering tool for commonly classifying, defining, and sharing information. This article proposes the development of modular ontologies based on different parts of the ISA-95 standard for describing the product, process, and resource information of manufacturing systems. In addition, this research work demonstrates a set of semantic rules that may be used for inferring implicit knowledge of the ontology that permits the automatic checking of the required machines to manufacture different product variants.\n\n###\n\n",

The first paper presents an ontology-driven approach to describe the components of industrial socio-cyberphysical systems, emphasizing the need for a digital twin to facilitate interaction between heterogeneous components (1). The second paper extends this by proposing an enhanced semantic model for factories, which includes a mapping to relational production databases, thus enabling federated queries and aiding in tasks such as assembly line identification and machine availability checks (2). The third paper tackles the challenge of integrating automation and information technology in Industry 4.0 by utilizing an ontology that adopts the multi-perspective RAMI4.0 framework, allowing for context-sensitive representations and the support of perspective-specific knowledge (3). The fourth paper presents ExtruOnt, an ontology designed for describing a specific type of manufacturing machine, which exemplifies the benefits of semantically rich descriptions in Industry 4.0 scenarios and serves as a model for other machine ontologies (4). Lastly, the fifth paper proposes the development of modular ontologies based on the ISA-95 standard, which are enriched with semantic rules to infer implicit knowledge of manufacturing systems, facilitating the automatic checking of machine capabilities for different product variants (5).

Anti-fatigue-fracture hydrogels\nNanocrystalline domains can be used to create robust anti-fatigue-fracture hydrogels for artificial cartilages and soft robots.\n\n2. Muscle-like fatigue-resistant hydrogels by mechanical training\nSignificance              The combinational muscle-like properties including high fatigue resistance, high strength, superior compliance, and high water content are highly desirable for various applications of soft biomaterials such as hydrogels. These combinational properties, largely attributed to the aligned nanofibrils in natural muscles, have not been achieved in synthetic hydrogels. Here, we propose a strategy of mechanical training to impart hydrogels with an extremely high fatigue threshold (1,250 J/m             2             ) and strength (5.2 MPa), while maintaining a high water content (84 wt %) and a low Young\u2019s modulus (200 kPa), reaching combinational muscle-like properties with aligned nanofibrillar architectures. We further achieve isotropically enhanced properties by three-dimensionally printing the hydrogels into microstructures.\n\n3. Anisotropic tough multilayer hydrogels with programmable orientation\nThis study presents a novel self-welding-based interfacial reconfiguration strategy for preparing anisotropic tough hydrogels with user-programmed hierarchical orientation.\n\n4. Freezing Molecular Orientation under Stretch for High Mechanical Strength but Anisotropic Hydrogels\nThe poor mechanical strength of hydrogels has largely limited their wide applications, and improving hydrogels' mechanical strength is a hot and important topic in the hydrogel research field. Although many successful strategies have been proposed to improve hydrogels' mechanical strength during the past decades, a hydrogel with a tensile stress surpassing dozens of mega Pascal is desirable, yet still a big challenge. To address this issue, the Fe(3+) -mediated physical crosslinking formed under stretch conditions was employed in a chemically crosslinked poly (acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) network to achieve a dual-crosslinked hydrogel. The expected molecular orientation occurs under stretch and allows the maximumu chelating interaction between pendant carboxylic anions and Fe(3+) and molecules conformation being frozen, leading to the mechanical strength improving dramatically. As a result, an unprecedentedly high mechanical strength, but anisotropic dual-crosslinked hydrogel was obtained. By optimizing the experimental parameters, the nominal tensile stress along pre-stretching direction can reach as high as \u224840 MPa with elastic modulus of \u224840 MPa at large strain (>200%). In addition, the molecular orientation also leads to big difference of mechanical performance between parallel and perpendicular direction.\n\n5. A Mineralized High Strength and Tough Hydrogel for Skull Bone Regeneration\nOver the past decade, high strength hydrogels have been intensively investigated. However, developing high strength biofunctional hydrogels for eliciting bone regeneration has been rarely reported. In this work, a mineralized high strength and tough hydrogel is synthesized by one\u2010step copolymerization of acrylonitrile, 1\u2010vinylimidazole, and polyethylene glycol diacrylate, followed by in situ precipitation mineralization. It is demonstrated that the CN\uf8ffCN dipole\u2013dipole pairings combined with the interaction of CaP nanocrystals with polymer chains contribute to tremendous increase of tensile/compressive strength, modulus, and fracture energy up to 6.1 MPa, 11.5 MPa, 6.47 MPa, and 7935 J m\u22122, respectively. The biomineralization is shown to facilitate the attachment and proliferation of C2C12 cells in vitro. This biomineralized hydrogel scaffold is implanted into an 8 mm diameter critical\u2010size of calvarial defect of rats to evaluate the bone regeneration. 12 week postsurgery results reveal that the mineralized hydrogel exhibits the highest bone volume and density within the defect as measured by computed tomography and histology. This mineralized high strength and tough hydrogel offers a broad range of possibilities to be developed as biofunctional scaffold to promote the reconstruction and regeneration of not only bone, but also load\u2010bearing connective tissue.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The methodologies employed in the development of hydrogels with enhanced mechanical properties are diverse and innovative. The first study (1) introduces the concept of nanocrystalline domains within hydrogels to mimic the structure of natural cartilages, achieving fatigue resistance through the formation of interlocking molecules. In contrast, the second paper (2) focuses on mechanical training to align nanofibrillar structures within hydrogels, similar to the organization of muscles, which results in a combination of high fatigue resistance, strength, compliance, and water content. This approach is complemented by the third study (3), which utilizes a self-welding-based interfacial reconfiguration strategy to create anisotropic multilayer hydrogels with programmable orientation, offering a unique approach to tailoring mechanical properties based on molecular organization.

Anti-fatigue-fracture hydrogels\nNanocrystalline domains can be used to create robust anti-fatigue-fracture hydrogels for artificial cartilages and soft robots.\n\n2. Muscle-like fatigue-resistant hydrogels by mechanical training\nSignificance              The combinational muscle-like properties including high fatigue resistance, high strength, superior compliance, and high water content are highly desirable for various applications of soft biomaterials such as hydrogels. These combinational properties, largely attributed to the aligned nanofibrils in natural muscles, have not been achieved in synthetic hydrogels. Here, we propose a strategy of mechanical training to impart hydrogels with an extremely high fatigue threshold (1,250 J/m             2             ) and strength (5.2 MPa), while maintaining a high water content (84 wt %) and a low Young\u2019s modulus (200 kPa), reaching combinational muscle-like properties with aligned nanofibrillar architectures. We further achieve isotropically enhanced properties by three-dimensionally printing the hydrogels into microstructures.\n\n3. Anisotropic tough multilayer hydrogels with programmable orientation\nThis study presents a novel self-welding-based interfacial reconfiguration strategy for preparing anisotropic tough hydrogels with user-programmed hierarchical orientation.\n\n4. Freezing Molecular Orientation under Stretch for High Mechanical Strength but Anisotropic Hydrogels\nThe poor mechanical strength of hydrogels has largely limited their wide applications, and improving hydrogels' mechanical strength is a hot and important topic in the hydrogel research field. Although many successful strategies have been proposed to improve hydrogels' mechanical strength during the past decades, a hydrogel with a tensile stress surpassing dozens of mega Pascal is desirable, yet still a big challenge. To address this issue, the Fe(3+) -mediated physical crosslinking formed under stretch conditions was employed in a chemically crosslinked poly (acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) network to achieve a dual-crosslinked hydrogel. The expected molecular orientation occurs under stretch and allows the maximumu chelating interaction between pendant carboxylic anions and Fe(3+) and molecules conformation being frozen, leading to the mechanical strength improving dramatically. As a result, an unprecedentedly high mechanical strength, but anisotropic dual-crosslinked hydrogel was obtained. By optimizing the experimental parameters, the nominal tensile stress along pre-stretching direction can reach as high as \u224840 MPa with elastic modulus of \u224840 MPa at large strain (>200%). In addition, the molecular orientation also leads to big difference of mechanical performance between parallel and perpendicular direction.\n\n5. A Mineralized High Strength and Tough Hydrogel for Skull Bone Regeneration\nOver the past decade, high strength hydrogels have been intensively investigated. However, developing high strength biofunctional hydrogels for eliciting bone regeneration has been rarely reported. In this work, a mineralized high strength and tough hydrogel is synthesized by one\u2010step copolymerization of acrylonitrile, 1\u2010vinylimidazole, and polyethylene glycol diacrylate, followed by in situ precipitation mineralization. It is demonstrated that the CN\uf8ffCN dipole\u2013dipole pairings combined with the interaction of CaP nanocrystals with polymer chains contribute to tremendous increase of tensile/compressive strength, modulus, and fracture energy up to 6.1 MPa, 11.5 MPa, 6.47 MPa, and 7935 J m\u22122, respectively. The biomineralization is shown to facilitate the attachment and proliferation of C2C12 cells in vitro. This biomineralized hydrogel scaffold is implanted into an 8 mm diameter critical\u2010size of calvarial defect of rats to evaluate the bone regeneration. 12 week postsurgery results reveal that the mineralized hydrogel exhibits the highest bone volume and density within the defect as measured by computed tomography and histology. This mineralized high strength and tough hydrogel offers a broad range of possibilities to be developed as biofunctional scaffold to promote the reconstruction and regeneration of not only bone, but also load\u2010bearing connective tissue.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the quest to enhance the mechanical properties of hydrogels, researchers have developed various strategies to mimic the structural and functional principles of natural materials. One approach involved the creation of anti-fatigue-fracture hydrogels by incorporating nanocrystalline domains, which demonstrated improved mechanical strength and toughness, making them suitable for artificial cartilage and soft robot applications (1). Another study achieved muscle-like properties in hydrogels through mechanical training, achieving high fatigue resistance, strength, and compliance, while maintaining flexibility and water content, with the potential for use in biomaterials and soft electronics (2). A novel method of interfacial reconfiguration was employed to create anisotropic tough multilayer hydrogels with programmable orientation, allowing for the manipulation of mechanical properties depending on the direction of force application (3). Addressing the challenge of low mechanical strength in hydrogels, a Fe(3+) -mediated physical crosslinking method was used to significantly improve tensile strength and elastic modulus, achieving a remarkable anisotropic dual-crosslinked hydrogel with high nominal tensile stress and strain (4). Lastly, a mineralized hydrogel was developed by copolymerization and in situ mineralization, which led to unprecedented high strength and toughness, with the added benefit of promoting bone regeneration, indicating its potential as a biofunctional scaffold for tissue engineering (5). Each of these studies contributes to the understanding and development of hydrogels, highlighting the importance of structural design and molecular engineering in tailoring their mechanical properties for specific applications.\n\n",

Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models\nWe investigate the optimal model size and number of tokens for training a transformer language model under a given compute budget. We \ufb01nd that current large language models are signi\ufb01cantly under-trained, a consequence of the recent focus on scaling language models whilst keeping the amount of training data constant. By training over 400 language models ranging from 70 million to over 16 billion parameters on 5 to 500 billion tokens, we \ufb01nd that for compute-optimal training, the model size and the number of training tokens should be scaled equally: for every doubling of model size the number of training tokens should also be doubled. We test this hypothesis by training a predicted compute-optimal model, Chinchilla , that uses the same compute budget as Gopher but with 70B parameters and 4 \u00d7 more more data. Chinchilla uniformly and signi\ufb01cantly outperforms Gopher (280B), GPT-3 (175B), Jurassic-1 (178B), and Megatron-Turing NLG (530B) on a large range of downstream evaluation tasks. This also means that Chinchilla uses substantially less compute for \ufb01ne-tuning and inference, greatly facilitating downstream usage. As a highlight, Chinchilla reaches a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 67.5% on the MMLU benchmark, greater than a 7% improvement over Gopher .\n\n2. Photorealistic Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Deep Language Understanding\nWe present Imagen, a text-to-image diffusion model with an unprecedented degree of photorealism and a deep level of language understanding. Imagen builds on the power of large transformer language models in understanding text and hinges on the strength of diffusion models in high-\ufb01delity image generation. Our key discovery is that generic large language models (e.g. T5), pretrained on text-only corpora, are surprisingly effective at encoding text for image synthesis: increasing the size of the language model in Imagen boosts both sample \ufb01delity and image-text alignment much more than increasing the size of the image diffusion model. Imagen achieves a new state-of-the-art FID score of 7.27 on the COCO dataset, without ever training on COCO, and human raters \ufb01nd Imagen samples to be on par with the COCO data itself in image-text alignment. To assess text-to-image models in greater depth, we introduce DrawBench, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for text-to-image models. With DrawBench, we compare Imagen with recent methods including VQ-GAN+CLIP, Latent Diffusion Models, GLIDE and DALL-E 2, and \ufb01nd that human raters prefer Imagen over other models in side-by-side comparisons, both in terms of sample quality and image-text alignment. See imagen.research.google for an overview of the results.\n\n3. One Embedder, Any Task: Instruction-Finetuned Text Embeddings\nWe introduce INSTRUCTOR, a new method for computing text embeddings given task instructions: every text input is embedded together with instructions explaining the use case (e.g., task and domain descriptions). Unlike encoders from prior work that are more specialized, INSTRUCTOR is a single embedder that can generate text embeddings tailored to different downstream tasks and domains, without any further training. We first annotate instructions for 330 diverse tasks and train INSTRUCTOR on this multitask mixture with a contrastive loss. We evaluate INSTRUCTOR on 70 embedding evaluation tasks (66 of which are unseen during training), ranging from classification and information retrieval to semantic textual similarity and text generation evaluation. INSTRUCTOR, while having an order of magnitude fewer parameters than the previous best model, achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average improvement of 3.4% compared to the previous best results on the 70 diverse datasets. Our analysis suggests that INSTRUCTOR is robust to changes in instructions, and that instruction finetuning mitigates the challenge of training a single model on diverse datasets. Our model, code, and data are available at https://instructor-embedding.github.io.\n\n4. CTRL: A Conditional Transformer Language Model for Controllable Generation\nLarge-scale language models show promising text generation capabilities, but users cannot easily control particular aspects of the generated text. We release CTRL, a 1.63 billion-parameter conditional transformer language model, trained to condition on control codes that govern style, content, and task-specific behavior. Control codes were derived from structure that naturally co-occurs with raw text, preserving the advantages of unsupervised learning while providing more explicit control over text generation. These codes also allow CTRL to predict which parts of the training data are most likely given a sequence. This provides a potential method for analyzing large amounts of data via model-based source attribution. We have released multiple full-sized, pretrained versions of CTRL at this https URL.\n\n5. Pythia: A suite for analyzing large language models across training and scaling\nHow do large language models (LLMs) develop and evolve over the course of training? How do these patterns change as models scale? To answer these questions, we introduce \\textit{Pythia}, a suite of 16 LLMs all trained on public data seen in the exact same order and ranging in size from 70M to 12B parameters. We provide public access to 154 checkpoints for each one of the 16 models, alongside tools to download and reconstruct their exact training dataloaders for further study. We intend \\textit{Pythia} to facilitate research in many areas, and we present several case studies including novel results in memorization, term frequency effects on few-shot performance, and reducing gender bias. We demonstrate that this highly controlled setup can be used to yield novel insights toward LLMs and their training dynamics. Trained models, analysis code, training code, and training data can be found at \\url{https://github.com/EleutherAI/pythia}.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of transformer models, recent research has focused on optimizing model architecture, training strategies, and the integration of language understanding and image generation tasks. The study on compute-optimal large language models (LLMs) training reveals the importance of scaling both model size and training tokens equally, suggesting that a balance between the two is crucial for achieving superior performance on various evaluation tasks (1). Similarly, the development of Imagen, a text-to-image diffusion model, emphasizes the role of pretrained language models in encoding text for image synthesis, with the model's effectiveness increasing as the size of the language model grows (2). The INSTRUCTOR model introduces a novel approach to text embeddings, leveraging instruction finetuning to generate embeddings tailored for diverse tasks without the need for further training, thus demonstrating the adaptability of a single embedder (3). CTRL, a conditional transformer language model, provides controllable text generation by conditioning on control codes, offering explicit control over style and content while still benefiting from unsupervised learning (4). Lastly, Pythia, a suite of LLMs trained on public data, facilitates the analysis of training and scaling dynamics, providing insights into memorization, term frequency, and bias reduction (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the transformative potential of transformer models and their capacity to adapt and scale effectively for various applications.",

Chinchilla uniformly and signi\ufb01cantly outperforms Gopher (280B), GPT-3 (175B), Jurassic-1 (178B), and Megatron-Turing NLG (530B) on a large range of downstream evaluation tasks. This also means that Chinchilla uses substantially less compute for \ufb01ne-tuning and inference, greatly facilitating downstream usage. As a highlight, Chinchilla reaches a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 67.5% on the MMLU benchmark, greater than a 7% improvement over Gopher .\n\n2. Photorealistic Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Deep Language Understanding\nWe present Imagen, a text-to-image diffusion model with an unprecedented degree of photorealism and a deep level of language understanding. Imagen builds on the power of large transformer language models in understanding text and hinges on the strength of diffusion models in high-\ufb01delity image generation. Our key discovery is that generic large language models (e.g. T5), pretrained on text-only corpora, are surprisingly effective at encoding text for image synthesis: increasing the size of the language model in Imagen boosts both sample \ufb01delity and image-text alignment much more than increasing the size of the image diffusion model. Imagen achieves a new state-of-the-art FID score of 7.27 on the COCO dataset, without ever training on COCO, and human raters \ufb01nd Imagen samples to be on par with the COCO data itself in image-text alignment. To assess text-to-image models in greater depth, we introduce DrawBench, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for text-to-image models. With DrawBench, we compare Imagen with recent methods including VQ-GAN+CLIP, Latent Diffusion Models, GLIDE and DALL-E 2, and \ufb01nd that human raters prefer Imagen over other models in side-by-side comparisons, both in terms of sample quality and image-text alignment. See imagen.research.google for an overview of the results.\n\n3. One Embedder, Any Task: Instruction-Finetuned Text Embeddings\nWe introduce INSTRUCTOR, a new method for computing text embeddings given task instructions: every text input is embedded together with instructions explaining the use case (e.g., task and domain descriptions). Unlike encoders from prior work that are more specialized, INSTRUCTOR is a single embedder that can generate text embeddings tailored to different downstream tasks and domains, without any further training. We first annotate instructions for 330 diverse tasks and train INSTRUCTOR on this multitask mixture with a contrastive loss. We evaluate INSTRUCTOR on 70 embedding evaluation tasks (66 of which are unseen during training), ranging from classification and information retrieval to semantic textual similarity and text generation evaluation. INSTRUCTOR, while having an order of magnitude fewer parameters than the previous best model, achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average improvement of 3.4% compared to the previous best results on the 70 diverse datasets. Our analysis suggests that INSTRUCTOR is robust to changes in instructions, and that instruction finetuning mitigates the challenge of training a single model on diverse datasets. Our model, code, and data are available at https://instructor-embedding.github.io.\n\n4. CTRL: A Conditional Transformer Language Model for Controllable Generation\nLarge-scale language models show promising text generation capabilities, but users cannot easily control particular aspects of the generated text. We release CTRL, a 1.63 billion-parameter conditional transformer language model, trained to condition on control codes that govern style, content, and task-specific behavior. Control codes were derived from structure that naturally co-occurs with raw text, preserving the advantages of unsupervised learning while providing more explicit control over text generation. These codes also allow CTRL to predict which parts of the training data are most likely given a sequence. This provides a potential method for analyzing large amounts of data via model-based source attribution. We have released multiple full-sized, pretrained versions of CTRL at this https URL.\n\n5. Pythia: A suite for analyzing large language models across training and scaling\nHow do large language models (LLMs) develop and evolve over the course of training? How do these patterns change as models scale? To answer these questions, we introduce \\textit{Pythia}, a suite of 16 LLMs all trained on public data seen in the exact same order and ranging in size from 70M to 12B parameters. We provide public access to 154 checkpoints for each one of the 16 models, alongside tools to download and reconstruct their exact training dataloaders for further study. We intend \\textit{Pythia} to facilitate research in many areas, and we present several case studies including novel results in memorization, term frequency effects on few-shot performance, and reducing gender bias. We demonstrate that this highly controlled setup can be used to yield novel insights toward LLMs and their training dynamics. Trained models, analysis code, training code, and training data can be found at \\url{https://github.com/EleutherAI/pythia}.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " Recent advancements in transformer models have highlighted the importance of model scaling and training strategies for achieving state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. In language modeling, it has been shown that equally scaling model size and the number of training tokens is crucial for compute-optimal training, as larger models can achieve superior performance with fewer tokens, as evidenced by the Chinchilla model's outperformance of its larger counterparts (1). Similarly, in text-to-image generation, large transformer language models, when pretrained on text-only corpora, have shown to encode text effectively for image synthesis, with models like Imagen achieving photorealism and language understanding beyond their size (2). The versatility of text embeddings is further accentuated by the INSTRUCTOR model, which, with a single embedder, can generate tailored text embeddings for diverse tasks and domains, demonstrating an improvement in performance over previous models (3). In controlled text generation, the CTRL model offers users explicit control over the style, content, and tasks through conditional training, opening avenues for controllable AI applications (4). Lastly, the Pythia suite serves as a valuable tool for analyzing the training and scaling dynamics of large language models, facilitating research and providing insights into the development of these complex systems (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the critical role of model design, training data, and scaling in unlocking the full potential of transformer models for various AI tasks.",

Big Bird: Transformers for Longer Sequences\nTransformers-based models, such as BERT, have been one of the most successful deep learning models for NLP. Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having $O(1)$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also propose novel applications to genomics data.\n\n2. BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension\nWe present BART, a denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence models. BART is trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture which, despite its simplicity, can be seen as generalizing BERT (due to the bidirectional encoder), GPT (with the left-to-right decoder), and other recent pretraining schemes. We evaluate a number of noising approaches, finding the best performance by both randomly shuffling the order of sentences and using a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token. BART is particularly effective when fine tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa on GLUE and SQuAD, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 3.5 ROUGE. BART also provides a 1.1 BLEU increase over a back-translation system for machine translation, with only target language pretraining. We also replicate other pretraining schemes within the BART framework, to understand their effect on end-task performance.\n\n3. GLIDE: Towards Photorealistic Image Generation and Editing with Text-Guided Diffusion Models\nDiffusion models have recently been shown to generate high-quality synthetic images, especially when paired with a guidance technique to trade off diversity for fidelity. We explore diffusion models for the problem of text-conditional image synthesis and compare two different guidance strategies: CLIP guidance and classifier-free guidance. We find that the latter is preferred by human evaluators for both photorealism and caption similarity, and often produces photorealistic samples. Samples from a 3.5 billion parameter text-conditional diffusion model using classifier-free guidance are favored by human evaluators to those from DALL-E, even when the latter uses expensive CLIP reranking. Additionally, we find that our models can be fine-tuned to perform image inpainting, enabling powerful text-driven image editing. We train a smaller model on a filtered dataset and release the code and weights at https://github.com/openai/glide-text2im.\n\n4. Switch Transformers: Scaling to Trillion Parameter Models with Simple and Efficient Sparsity\nIn deep learning, models typically reuse the same parameters for all inputs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models defy this and instead select di\ufb00erent parameters for each incoming example. The result is a sparsely-activated model\u2014with an outrageous number of parameters\u2014but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs, and training instability. We address these with the introduction of the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques mitigate the instabilities, and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the \ufb01rst time, with lower precision (b\ufb02oat16) formats. We design models based o\ufb00 T5-Base and T5-Large (Ra\ufb00el et al., 2019) to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the \u201cColossal Clean Crawled Corpus\u201d, and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model. 1 present in each. These benchmarks consist of tasks requiring sentiment analysis (SST-2), word sense disambiguation (WIC), sentence similarty (MRPC, STS-B, QQP), natural language inference (MNLI, QNLI, RTE, CB), question answering (MultiRC, RECORD, BoolQ), coreference resolution (WNLI, WSC) and sentence completion (COPA) and sentence acceptability (CoLA). The CNNDM (Hermann et al., 2015) and BBC XSum (Narayan et al., 2018) data sets are used to measure the ability to summarize articles. Question answering is probed with the SQuAD data set (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) and the ARC Reasoning Challenge (Clark et al., 2018). And as in Roberts et al. (2020), we evaluate the knowledge of our models by \ufb01ne-tuning on three closed-book question answering data sets: Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), Web Questions (Berant et al., 2013) and Trivia QA (Joshi et al., 2017).

Megatron-LM: Training Multi-Billion Parameter Language Models Using Model Parallelism\nRecent work in language modeling demonstrates that training large transformer models advances the state of the art in Natural Language Processing applications. However, very large models can be quite difficult to train due to memory constraints. In this work, we present our techniques for training very large transformer models and implement a simple, efficient intra-layer model parallel approach that enables training transformer models with billions of parameters. Our approach does not require a new compiler or library changes, is orthogonal and complimentary to pipeline model parallelism, and can be fully implemented with the insertion of a few communication operations in native PyTorch. We illustrate this approach by converging transformer based models up to 8.3 billion parameters using 512 GPUs. We sustain 15.1 PetaFLOPs across the entire application with 76% scaling efficiency when compared to a strong single GPU baseline that sustains 39 TeraFLOPs, which is 30% of peak FLOPs. To demonstrate that large language models can further advance the state of the art (SOTA), we train an 8.3 billion parameter transformer language model similar to GPT-2 and a 3.9 billion parameter model similar to BERT. We show that careful attention to the placement of layer normalization in BERT-like models is critical to achieving increased performance as the model size grows. Using the GPT-2 model we achieve SOTA results on the WikiText103 (10.8 compared to SOTA perplexity of 15.8) and LAMBADA (66.5% compared to SOTA accuracy of 63.2%) datasets. Our BERT model achieves SOTA results on the RACE dataset (90.9% compared to SOTA accuracy of 89.4%).\n\n###\n\n",

Big Bird: Transformers for Longer Sequences\nTransformers-based models, such as BERT, have been one of the most successful deep learning models for NLP. Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having $O(1)$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also propose novel applications to genomics data.\n\n2. BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension\nWe present BART, a denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence models. BART is trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture which, despite its simplicity, can be seen as generalizing BERT (due to the bidirectional encoder), GPT (with the left-to-right decoder), and other recent pretraining schemes. We evaluate a number of noising approaches, finding the best performance by both randomly shuffling the order of sentences and using a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token. BART is particularly effective when fine tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa on GLUE and SQuAD, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 3.5 ROUGE. BART also provides a 1.1 BLEU increase over a back-translation system for machine translation, with only target language pretraining. We also replicate other pretraining schemes within the BART framework, to understand their effect on end-task performance.\n\n3. GLIDE: Towards Photorealistic Image Generation and Editing with Text-Guided Diffusion Models\nDiffusion models have recently been shown to generate high-quality synthetic images, especially when paired with a guidance technique to trade off diversity for fidelity. We explore diffusion models for the problem of text-conditional image synthesis and compare two different guidance strategies: CLIP guidance and classifier-free guidance. We find that the latter is preferred by human evaluators for both photorealism and caption similarity, and often produces photorealistic samples. Samples from a 3.5 billion parameter text-conditional diffusion model using classifier-free guidance are favored by human evaluators to those from DALL-E, even when the latter uses expensive CLIP reranking. Additionally, we find that our models can be fine-tuned to perform image inpainting, enabling powerful text-driven image editing. We train a smaller model on a filtered dataset and release the code and weights at https://github.com/openai/glide-text2im.\n\n4. Switch Transformers: Scaling to Trillion Parameter Models with Simple and Efficient Sparsity\nIn deep learning, models typically reuse the same parameters for all inputs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models defy this and instead select di\ufb00erent parameters for each incoming example. The result is a sparsely-activated model\u2014with an outrageous number of parameters\u2014but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs, and training instability. We address these with the introduction of the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques mitigate the instabilities, and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the \ufb01rst time, with lower precision (b\ufb02oat16) formats. We design models based o\ufb00 T5-Base and T5-Large (Ra\ufb00el et al., 2019) to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the \u201cColossal Clean Crawled Corpus\u201d, and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model. 1 present in each. These benchmarks consist of tasks requiring sentiment analysis (SST-2), word sense disambiguation (WIC), sentence similarty (MRPC, STS-B, QQP), natural language inference (MNLI, QNLI, RTE, CB), question answering (MultiRC, RECORD, BoolQ), coreference resolution (WNLI, WSC) and sentence completion (COPA) and sentence acceptability (CoLA). The CNNDM (Hermann et al., 2015) and BBC XSum (Narayan et al., 2018) data sets are used to measure the ability to summarize articles. Question answering is probed with the SQuAD data set (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) and the ARC Reasoning Challenge (Clark et al., 2018). And as in Roberts et al. (2020), we evaluate the knowledge of our models by \ufb01ne-tuning on three closed-book question answering data sets: Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), Web Questions (Berant et al., 2013) and Trivia QA (Joshi et al., 2017).

Megatron-LM: Training Multi-Billion Parameter Language Models Using Model Parallelism\nRecent work in language modeling demonstrates that training large transformer models advances the state of the art in Natural Language Processing applications. However, very large models can be quite difficult to train due to memory constraints. In this work, we present our techniques for training very large transformer models and implement a simple, efficient intra-layer model parallel approach that enables training transformer models with billions of parameters. Our approach does not require a new compiler or library changes, is orthogonal and complimentary to pipeline model parallelism, and can be fully implemented with the insertion of a few communication operations in native PyTorch. We illustrate this approach by converging transformer based models up to 8.3 billion parameters using 512 GPUs. We sustain 15.1 PetaFLOPs across the entire application with 76% scaling efficiency when compared to a strong single GPU baseline that sustains 39 TeraFLOPs, which is 30% of peak FLOPs. To demonstrate that large language models can further advance the state of the art (SOTA), we train an 8.3 billion parameter transformer language model similar to GPT-2 and a 3.9 billion parameter model similar to BERT. We show that careful attention to the placement of layer normalization in BERT-like models is critical to achieving increased performance as the model size grows. Using the GPT-2 model we achieve SOTA results on the WikiText103 (10.8 compared to SOTA perplexity of 15.8) and LAMBADA (66.5% compared to SOTA accuracy of 63.2%) datasets. Our BERT model achieves SOTA results on the RACE dataset (90.9% compared to SOTA accuracy of 89.4%).\n\n###\n\n",

Deberta: Decoding-enhanced bert with disentangled attention\nRecent progress in pre-trained neural language models has significantly improved the performance of many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper we propose a new model architecture DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention) that improves the BERT and RoBERTa models using two novel techniques. The first is the disentangled attention mechanism, where each word is represented using two vectors that encode its content and position, respectively, and the attention weights among words are computed using disentangled matrices on their contents and relative positions. Second, an enhanced mask decoder is used to replace the output softmax layer to predict the masked tokens for model pretraining. We show that these two techniques significantly improve the efficiency of model pre-training and performance of downstream tasks. Compared to RoBERTa-Large, a DeBERTa model trained on half of the training data performs consistently better on a wide range of NLP tasks, achieving improvements on MNLI by +0.9% (90.2% vs. 91.1%), on SQuAD v2.0 by +2.3% (88.4% vs. 90.7%) and RACE by +3.6% (83.2% vs. 86.8%). The DeBERTa code and pre-trained models will be made publicly available at this https URL.\n\n2. OPT: Open Pre-trained Transformer Language Models\nLarge language models, which are often trained for hundreds of thousands of compute days, have shown remarkable capabilities for zero- and few-shot learning. Given their computational cost, these models are dif\ufb01cult to replicate without signi\ufb01cant capital. For the few that are available through APIs, no access is granted to the full model weights, making them dif\ufb01cult to study. We present Open Pre-trained Transformers (OPT), a suite of decoder-only pre-trained transformers ranging from 125M to 175B parameters, which we aim to fully and responsibly share with interested researchers. We show that OPT-175B is comparable to GPT-3, 1 while requiring only 1/7th the carbon footprint to develop. We are also releasing our logbook detailing the infrastructure challenges we faced, along with code for experimenting with all of the released models.\n\n3. Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training\nNatural language understanding comprises a wide range of diverse tasks such as textual entailment, question answering, semantic similarity assessment, and document classi\ufb01cation. Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant, labeled data for learning these speci\ufb01c tasks is scarce, making it challenging for discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative \ufb01ne-tuning on each speci\ufb01c task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-aware input transformations during \ufb01ne-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language understanding. Our general task-agnostic model outperforms discriminatively trained models that use architectures speci\ufb01cally crafted for each task, signi\ufb01cantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied. For instance, we achieve absolute improvements of 8.9% on commonsense reasoning (Stories Cloze Test), 5.7% on question answering (RACE), and 1.5% on textual entailment (MultiNLI).\n\n4. Decision Transformer: Reinforcement Learning via Sequence Modeling\nWe introduce a framework that abstracts Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a sequence modeling problem. This allows us to draw upon the simplicity and scalability of the Transformer architecture, and associated advances in language modeling such as GPT-x and BERT. In particular, we present Decision Transformer, an architecture that casts the problem of RL as conditional sequence modeling. Unlike prior approaches to RL that fit value functions or compute policy gradients, Decision Transformer simply outputs the optimal actions by leveraging a causally masked Transformer. By conditioning an autoregressive model on the desired return (reward), past states, and actions, our Decision Transformer model can generate future actions that achieve the desired return. Despite its simplicity, Decision Transformer matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art model-free offline RL baselines on Atari, OpenAI Gym, and Key-to-Door tasks.\n\n5. High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models\nBy decomposing the image formation process into a sequential application of denoising autoencoders, diffusion models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art synthesis results on image data and beyond. Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve new state of the art scores for image inpainting and class-conditional image synthesis and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, text-to-image synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs.\n\n###\n\n",

Deberta: Decoding-enhanced bert with disentangled attention\nRecent progress in pre-trained neural language models has significantly improved the performance of many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper we propose a new model architecture DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention) that improves the BERT and RoBERTa models using two novel techniques. The first is the disentangled attention mechanism, where each word is represented using two vectors that encode its content and position, respectively, and the attention weights among words are computed using disentangled matrices on their contents and relative positions. Second, an enhanced mask decoder is used to replace the output softmax layer to predict the masked tokens for model pretraining. We show that these two techniques significantly improve the efficiency of model pre-training and performance of downstream tasks. Compared to RoBERTa-Large, a DeBERTa model trained on half of the training data performs consistently better on a wide range of NLP tasks, achieving improvements on MNLI by +0.9% (90.2% vs. 91.1%), on SQuAD v2.0 by +2.3% (88.4% vs. 90.7%) and RACE by +3.6% (83.2% vs. 86.8%). The DeBERTa code and pre-trained models will be made publicly available at this https URL.\n\n2. OPT: Open Pre-trained Transformer Language Models\nLarge language models, which are often trained for hundreds of thousands of compute days, have shown remarkable capabilities for zero- and few-shot learning. Given their computational cost, these models are dif\ufb01cult to replicate without signi\ufb01cant capital. For the few that are available through APIs, no access is granted to the full model weights, making them dif\ufb01cult to study. We present Open Pre-trained Transformers (OPT), a suite of decoder-only pre-trained transformers ranging from 125M to 175B parameters, which we aim to fully and responsibly share with interested researchers. We show that OPT-175B is comparable to GPT-3, 1 while requiring only 1/7th the carbon footprint to develop. We are also releasing our logbook detailing the infrastructure challenges we faced, along with code for experimenting with all of the released models.\n\n3. Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training\nNatural language understanding comprises a wide range of diverse tasks such as textual entailment, question answering, semantic similarity assessment, and document classi\ufb01cation. Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant, labeled data for learning these speci\ufb01c tasks is scarce, making it challenging for discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative \ufb01ne-tuning on each speci\ufb01c task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-aware input transformations during \ufb01ne-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language understanding. Our general task-agnostic model outperforms discriminatively trained models that use architectures speci\ufb01cally crafted for each task, signi\ufb01cantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied. For instance, we achieve absolute improvements of 8.9% on commonsense reasoning (Stories Cloze Test), 5.7% on question answering (RACE), and 1.5% on textual entailment (MultiNLI).\n\n4. Decision Transformer: Reinforcement Learning via Sequence Modeling\nWe introduce a framework that abstracts Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a sequence modeling problem. This allows us to draw upon the simplicity and scalability of the Transformer architecture, and associated advances in language modeling such as GPT-x and BERT. In particular, we present Decision Transformer, an architecture that casts the problem of RL as conditional sequence modeling. Unlike prior approaches to RL that fit value functions or compute policy gradients, Decision Transformer simply outputs the optimal actions by leveraging a causally masked Transformer. By conditioning an autoregressive model on the desired return (reward), past states, and actions, our Decision Transformer model can generate future actions that achieve the desired return. Despite its simplicity, Decision Transformer matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art model-free offline RL baselines on Atari, OpenAI Gym, and Key-to-Door tasks.\n\n5. High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models\nBy decomposing the image formation process into a sequential application of denoising autoencoders, diffusion models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art synthesis results on image data and beyond. Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve new state of the art scores for image inpainting and class-conditional image synthesis and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, text-to-image synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of transformer models, DeBerta introduces a novel architecture that enhances BERT's performance with a disentangled attention mechanism and an improved mask decoder, achieving superior results on various NLP tasks with less training data (1). OPT provides a solution to the inaccessibility of large language models by releasing a suite of pre-trained transformers, including an OPT-175B model that matches GPT-3's performance while being significantly more environmentally friendly, along with a detailed logbook for research replication (2). Generative pre-training, as proposed in another study, demonstrates that pre-training on a diverse corpus followed by task-specific fine-tuning can substantially improve natural language understanding tasks, outperforming task-specific models even when the latter are architecturally different from the former (3). The Decision Transformer reframes reinforcement learning as a sequence modeling task, utilizing a causally masked Transformer to predict optimal actions, thereby simplifying the RL paradigm and achieving competitive results in various benchmarks (4). Lastly, High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) leverages the sequential application of denoising autoencoders in diffusion models, combining them with cross-attention layers for flexibility in conditioning inputs, which results in state-of-the-art image synthesis while reducing computational demands (5).

Finetuned language models are zero-shot learners\nA BSTRACT This paper explores a simple method for improving the zero-shot learning abilities of language models. We show that instruction tuning \u2014\ufb01netuning language models on a collection of datasets described via instructions\u2014substantially improves zero-shot performance on unseen tasks. We take a 137B parameter pretrained language model and instruction tune it on over 60 NLP datasets verbalized via natural language instruction templates. We evaluate this instruction-tuned model, which we call FLAN, on unseen task types. FLAN substantially improves the performance of its unmodi\ufb01ed counterpart and surpasses zero-shot 175B GPT-3 on 20 of 25 datasets that we evaluate. FLAN even outperforms few-shot GPT-3 by a large margin on ANLI, RTE, BoolQ, AI2-ARC, OpenbookQA, and StoryCloze. Ablation studies reveal that number of \ufb01netuning datasets, model scale, and natural language instructions are key to the success of instruction tuning. many tasks\n\n2. XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding\nWith the capability of modeling bidirectional contexts, denoising autoencoding based pretraining like BERT achieves better performance than pretraining approaches based on autoregressive language modeling. However, relying on corrupting the input with masks, BERT neglects dependency between the masked positions and suffers from a pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In light of these pros and cons, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining. Empirically, under comparable experiment settings, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large margin, including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking.\n\n3. Solving Quantitative Reasoning Problems with Language Models\nLanguage models have achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of tasks that require natural language understanding. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art models have generally struggled with tasks that require quantitative reasoning, such as solving mathematics, science, and engineering problems at the college level. To help close this gap, we introduce Minerva , a large language model pretrained on general natural language data and further trained on technical content. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on technical benchmarks without the use of external tools. We also evaluate our model on over two hundred undergraduate-level problems in physics, biology, chemistry, economics, and other sciences that require quantitative reasoning, and find that the model can correctly answer nearly a third of them.\n\n4. Hierarchical Text-Conditional Image Generation with CLIP Latents\nContrastive models like CLIP have been shown to learn robust representations of images that capture both semantics and style. To leverage these representations for image generation, we propose a two-stage model: a prior that generates a CLIP image embedding given a text caption, and a decoder that generates an image conditioned on the image embedding. We show that explicitly generating image representations improves image diversity with minimal loss in photorealism and caption similarity. Our decoders conditioned on image representations can also produce variations of an image that preserve both its semantics and style, while varying the non-essential details absent from the image representation. We use diffusion models for the decoder and experiment with both autoregressive and diffusion models for the prior, finding that the latter are computationally more efficient and produce higher-quality samples.\n\n5. GPT-4 Technical Report\nWe report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4's performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4.\n\n###\n\n",

To help close this gap, we introduce Minerva , a large language model pretrained on general natural language data and further trained on technical content. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on technical benchmarks without the use of external tools. We also evaluate our model on over two hundred undergraduate-level problems in physics, biology, chemistry, economics, and other sciences that require quantitative reasoning, and find that the model can correctly answer nearly a third of them.\n\n4. Hierarchical Text-Conditional Image Generation with CLIP Latents\nContrastive models like CLIP have been shown to learn robust representations of images that capture both semantics and style. To leverage these representations for image generation, we propose a two-stage model: a prior that generates a CLIP image embedding given a text caption, and a decoder that generates an image conditioned on the image embedding. We show that explicitly generating image representations improves image diversity with minimal loss in photorealism and caption similarity. Our decoders conditioned on image representations can also produce variations of an image that preserve both its semantics and style, while varying the non-essential details absent from the image representation. We use diffusion models for the decoder and experiment with both autoregressive and diffusion models for the prior, finding that the latter are computationally more efficient and produce higher-quality samples.\n\n5. GPT-4 Technical Report\nWe report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4's performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4.\n\n###\n\n",

Finetuned language models are zero-shot learners\nA BSTRACT This paper explores a simple method for improving the zero-shot learning abilities of language models. We show that instruction tuning \u2014\ufb01netuning language models on a collection of datasets described via instructions\u2014substantially improves zero-shot performance on unseen tasks. We take a 137B parameter pretrained language model and instruction tune it on over 60 NLP datasets verbalized via natural language instruction templates. We evaluate this instruction-tuned model, which we call FLAN, on unseen task types. FLAN substantially improves the performance of its unmodi\ufb01ed counterpart and surpasses zero-shot 175B GPT-3 on 20 of 25 datasets that we evaluate. FLAN even outperforms few-shot GPT-3 by a large margin on ANLI, RTE, BoolQ, AI2-ARC, OpenbookQA, and StoryCloze. Ablation studies reveal that number of \ufb01netuning datasets, model scale, and natural language instructions are key to the success of instruction tuning. many tasks\n\n2. XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding\nWith the capability of modeling bidirectional contexts, denoising autoencoding based pretraining like BERT achieves better performance than pretraining approaches based on autoregressive language modeling. However, relying on corrupting the input with masks, BERT neglects dependency between the masked positions and suffers from a pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In light of these pros and cons, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining. Empirically, under comparable experiment settings, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large margin, including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking.\n\n3.

Bhattacharya_Lab at SemEval-2023 Task 12: A Transformer-based Language Model for Sentiment Classification for Low Resource African Languages: Nigerian Pidgin and Yoruba\nSentiment Analysis is an aspect of natural languageprocessing (NLP) that has been a topicof research. While most studies focus on highresourcelanguages with an extensive amountof available data, the study on low-resource languageswith insufficient data needs attention.To address this issue, we propose a transformerbasedmethod for sentiment analysis for lowresourcesAfrican languages, Nigerian Pidginand Yoruba. To evaluate the effectiveness ofour multilingual language models for monolingualsentiment classification, we participated inthe AfriSenti SemEval shared task 2023 competition.On the official e valuation s et, ourgroup (named as Bhattacharya_Lab) ranked1 out of 33 participating groups in the MonolingualSentiment Classification task (i.e., TaskA) for Nigerian Pidgin (i.e., Track 4), and inthe Top 5 among 33 participating groups inthe Monolingual Sentiment Classification taskfor Yoruba (i.e., Track 2) respectively, demonstratingthe potential for our transformer-basedlanguage models to improve sentiment analysisin low-resource languages. Overall, ourstudy highlights the importance of exploringthe potential of NLP in low-resource languagesand the impact of transformer-based multilinguallanguage models in sentiment analysis forthe low-resource African languages, NigerianPidgin and Yoruba.\n\n2. UM6P at SemEval-2023 Task 12: Out-Of-Distribution Generalization Method for African Languages Sentiment Analysis\nThis paper presents our submitted system to AfriSenti SemEval-2023 Task 12: Sentiment Analysis for African Languages. The AfriSenti consists of three different tasks, covering monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot sentiment analysis scenarios for African languages. To improve model generalization, we have explored the following steps: 1) further pre-training of the AfroXLM Pre-trained Language Model (PLM), 2) combining AfroXLM and MARBERT PLMs using a residual layer, and 3) studying the impact of metric learning and two out-of-distribution generalization training objectives. The overall evaluation results show that our system has achieved promising results on several sub-tasks of Task A. For Tasks B and C, our system is ranked among the top six participating systems.\n\n3. UCAS-IIE-NLP at SemEval-2023 Task 12: Enhancing Generalization of Multilingual BERT for Low-resource Sentiment Analysis\nThis paper describes our system designed for SemEval-2023 Task 12: Sentiment analysis for African languages. The challenge faced by this task is the scarcity of labeled data and linguistic resources in low-resource settings. To alleviate these, we propose a generalized multilingual system SACL-XLMR for sentiment analysis on low-resource languages. Specifically, we design a lexicon-based multilingual BERT to facilitate language adaptation and sentiment-aware representation learning. Besides, we apply a supervised adversarial contrastive learning technique to learn sentiment-spread structured representations and enhance model generalization. Our system achieved competitive results, largely outperforming baselines on both multilingual and zero-shot sentiment classification subtasks. Notably, the system obtained the 1st rank on the zero-shot classification subtask in the official ranking. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.\n\n4. Trinity at SemEval-2023 Task 12: Sentiment Analysis for Low-resource African Languages using Twitter Dataset\nIn this paper, we have performed sentiment analysis on three African languages (Hausa, Swahili, and Yoruba). We used various deep learning and traditional models paired with a vectorizer for classification and data -preprocessing. We have also used a few data oversampling methods to handle the imbalanced text data. Thus, we could analyze the performance of those models in all the languages by using weighted and macro F1 scores as evaluation metrics.\n\n5. UMUTeam at SemEval-2023 Task 12: Ensemble Learning of LLMs applied to Sentiment Analysis for Low-resource African Languages\nThese working notes summarize the participation of the UMUTeam in the SemEval 2023 shared task: AfriSenti, focused on Sentiment Analysis in several African languages. Two subtasks are proposed, one in which each language is considered separately and another one in which all languages are merged. Our proposal to solve both subtasks is grounded on the combination of features extracted from several multilingual Large Language Models and a subset of language-independent linguistic features. Our best results are achieved with the African languages less represented in the training set: Xitsonga, a Mozambique dialect, with a weighted f1-score of 54.89\\%; Algerian Arabic, with a weighted f1-score of 68.52\\%; Swahili, with a weighted f1-score of 60.52\\%; and Twi, with a weighted f1-score of 71.14%.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In addressing the challenge of sentiment analysis for low-resource African languages, recent methodologies have demonstrates the utility of transformer-based language models, pre-trained on large corpora and fine-tuned for sentiment classification (1, 3, 5). The Bhattacharya_Lab team (1) employed a transformer-based language model, leveraging its performance on monolingual sentiment classification tasks for Nigerian Pidgin and Yoruba, while UCAS-IIE-NLP (3) enhanced generalization by introducing a lexicon-based multilingual BERT, coupled with supervised adversarial contrastive learning to improve sentiment-aware representation learning. Similarly, UM6P (2) explored out-of-distribution generalization methodologies, combining AfroXLM and MARBERT PLMs with a residual layer, and applying metric learning to aid in sentiment analysis. These approaches are complemented by the use of deep learning and traditional models, paired with vectorization for classification, as seen in the Trinity team's (4) work. Lastly, UMUTeam (5) pursued an ensemble learning strategy, combining features from multiple multilingual Large Language Models with language-independent linguistic features. Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of model adaptation and representation learning in enhancing sentiment analysis for African languages, with a focus on leveraging existing resources and data oversampling techniques to address the scarcity of labeled data (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n\n",

Bhattacharya_Lab at SemEval-2023 Task 12: A Transformer-based Language Model for Sentiment Classification for Low Resource African Languages: Nigerian Pidgin and Yoruba\nSentiment Analysis is an aspect of natural languageprocessing (NLP) that has been a topicof research. While most studies focus on highresourcelanguages with an extensive amountof available data, the study on low-resource languageswith insufficient data needs attention.To address this issue, we propose a transformerbasedmethod for sentiment analysis for lowresourcesAfrican languages, Nigerian Pidginand Yoruba. To evaluate the effectiveness ofour multilingual language models for monolingualsentiment classification, we participated inthe AfriSenti SemEval shared task 2023 competition.On the official e valuation s et, ourgroup (named as Bhattacharya_Lab) ranked1 out of 33 participating groups in the MonolingualSentiment Classification task (i.e., TaskA) for Nigerian Pidgin (i.e., Track 4), and inthe Top 5 among 33 participating groups inthe Monolingual Sentiment Classification taskfor Yoruba (i.e., Track 2) respectively, demonstratingthe potential for our transformer-basedlanguage models to improve sentiment analysisin low-resource languages. Overall, ourstudy highlights the importance of exploringthe potential of NLP in low-resource languagesand the impact of transformer-based multilinguallanguage models in sentiment analysis forthe low-resource African languages, NigerianPidgin and Yoruba.\n\n2. UM6P at SemEval-2023 Task 12: Out-Of-Distribution Generalization Method for African Languages Sentiment Analysis\nThis paper presents our submitted system to AfriSenti SemEval-2023 Task 12: Sentiment Analysis for African Languages. The AfriSenti consists of three different tasks, covering monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot sentiment analysis scenarios for African languages. To improve model generalization, we have explored the following steps: 1) further pre-training of the AfroXLM Pre-trained Language Model (PLM), 2) combining AfroXLM and MARBERT PLMs using a residual layer, and 3) studying the impact of metric learning and two out-of-distribution generalization training objectives. The overall evaluation results show that our system has achieved promising results on several sub-tasks of Task A. For Tasks B and C, our system is ranked among the top six participating systems.\n\n3. UCAS-IIE-NLP at SemEval-2023 Task 12: Enhancing Generalization of Multilingual BERT for Low-resource Sentiment Analysis\nThis paper describes our system designed for SemEval-2023 Task 12: Sentiment analysis for African languages. The challenge faced by this task is the scarcity of labeled data and linguistic resources in low-resource settings. To alleviate these, we propose a generalized multilingual system SACL-XLMR for sentiment analysis on low-resource languages. Specifically, we design a lexicon-based multilingual BERT to facilitate language adaptation and sentiment-aware representation learning. Besides, we apply a supervised adversarial contrastive learning technique to learn sentiment-spread structured representations and enhance model generalization. Our system achieved competitive results, largely outperforming baselines on both multilingual and zero-shot sentiment classification subtasks. Notably, the system obtained the 1st rank on the zero-shot classification subtask in the official ranking. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.\n\n4. Trinity at SemEval-2023 Task 12: Sentiment Analysis for Low-resource African Languages using Twitter Dataset\nIn this paper, we have performed sentiment analysis on three African languages (Hausa, Swahili, and Yoruba). We used various deep learning and traditional models paired with a vectorizer for classification and data -preprocessing. We have also used a few data oversampling methods to handle the imbalanced text data. Thus, we could analyze the performance of those models in all the languages by using weighted and macro F1 scores as evaluation metrics.\n\n5. UMUTeam at SemEval-2023 Task 12: Ensemble Learning of LLMs applied to Sentiment Analysis for Low-resource African Languages\nThese working notes summarize the participation of the UMUTeam in the SemEval 2023 shared task: AfriSenti, focused on Sentiment Analysis in several African languages. Two subtasks are proposed, one in which each language is considered separately and another one in which all languages are merged. Our proposal to solve both subtasks is grounded on the combination of features extracted from several multilingual Large Language Models and a subset of language-independent linguistic features. Our best results are achieved with the African languages less represented in the training set: Xitsonga, a Mozambique dialect, with a weighted f1-score of 54.89\\%; Algerian Arabic, with a weighted f1-score of 68.52\\%; Swahili, with a weighted f1-score of 60.52\\%; and Twi, with a weighted f1-score of 71.14%.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " Recent advancements in sentiment analysis for African languages have underscored the significance of leveraging transformer-based language models and ensemble learning techniques to address the challenges posed by low-resource data and linguistic diversity. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of multilingual language models such as AfroXLM and the combination of AfroXLM with other pre-trained models like MARBERT in enhancing sentiment classification for languages like Nigerian Pidgin and Yoruba (1, 2). The use of lexicon-based multilingual BERT, coupled with supervised adversarial contrastive learning, has also been identified as a method to facilitate language adaptation and sentiment-aware representation learning, achieving competitive results in both multilingual and zero-shot sentiment classification (3). Moreover, ensemble learning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been proposed, with the combination of features extracted from these models and language-independent linguistic features showing promising results, especially for less represented languages like Xitsonga and Twi (5). These studies collectively highlight the potential of advanced machine learning techniques to improve sentiment analysis in the context of African languages, emphasizing the need for further research and development in this domain to address the unique challenges posed by the diverse and often data-scarce nature of African languages (1-5).\n\n",

Analysis of the efficiency of land transport connectivity for international trade between Thailand and China\nAbstract This paper aims to analyze the efficiency of land transport connectivity for international trade between Thailand and China, focusing on the 4 main routes (R3A, R8, R9, and R12). The study commenced by taking the data of time, cost, and distance for transportation and border process of general cargo with 40 feet containers collected from field surveys and in-depth interviews of 126 key-informants from the 4 countries involved (Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and China). The data are analyzed, and created the relationship graphics by Time Cost Distance Analysis to evaluate the efficiency of the linkage land transport routes on trade between Thailand and China to identify the bottlenecks/obstacles along the 4 routes. This study will support government agencies in policy decision-making to improve the efficiency of each route. The result found that R9 is the most efficient route due to the low approximate transport cost (3.39 US dollars/km.) and the highest approximate speed (44.52\u2009km./hr.). It is also found that the average Border Process Cost of routes R9, R8, and R12 is approximately 40% of the Total Cost, while the average Border Process Time of each route is approximately 16\u201325% of the Total Time, which shows that the border process cost and time of each route is quite high compared to operations along the route. Therefore, the government agencies of these 4 countries should jointly formulate policies related to the Border Process in order to develop more efficient land transport connectivity for Thailand and China\u2019s international trade.\n\n2. An Optimization Route Selection Method of Urban Oversize Cargo Transportation\nIn order to select the optimal transportation route among alternative transportation routes more accurately and objectively, the choice of urban oversize cargo transportation routes was studied by taking the optimization weight\u2013TOPSIS combination method for specific calculations. This model, based on an entropy weight method, cloud model, and TOPSIS method, combines the superiority of the cloud model for reflecting the randomness and discreteness of subjective evaluation with the advantages of the TOPSIS method in dealing with the problem of multi-objective programming. Through selecting and classifying several the main road influencing factors of urban oversize cargo transportation, based on the data of four urban roads, the entropy weight method is used to initially determine the weights of each influencing factor, the cloud model is used to optimize weights, the TOPSIS method is used to compare and evaluate the paths, and the optimal transportation route is selected on this basis. The results showed that the optimization weight\u2013TOPSIS method is scientific and accurate for the multi-objective planning of oversize cargo transportation route selection, and solves the problem of the impact of subjective factors in existing methods and the difficulty of processing multiple influencing factors. The Pearson consistency test results show that the Pearson correlation coefficient between the proposed method and the actual oversize cargo transportation route selection is 0.995, which is higher than the calculation results without using the combination weight.\n\n3. An AIMMS-based decision-making model for optimizing the intelligent stowage of export containers in a single bay\nStowage operations in container terminals are an important part of a port's operational system, as the quality of stowage operations will directly affect the efficiency of port loading and discharge operations, and the scheduling of container shipping liners. The intelligent stowage of containers in container ships was studied in this work. A multi-objective integer programming model was constructed with the minimization of container rehandling, yard crane movements, and the sum of weight differences between stacked container pairs as its objective functions, to address the need for intelligent optimization of single bay export container stowage on a ship's deck. This model also satisfies the stability requirements of preliminary stowage plans drawn by shipping companies, and the operational requirements of container terminals. Linear computational methods were then constructed to transform non-linear constraints into linear ones for better AIMMS solution. Through numerous case analyses and systematic tests, it was shown that our system is able to rapidly solve for stowage planning optimization problems with complex preliminary stowage data, thus proving the applicability and effectiveness of this model. In particular, the application of this model will simultaneously address the safety of ship voyages, the transportation quality of shipping containers and other forms of cargo, and the cost efficiency of ship operations. In addition, this model will also contribute to the optimization of loading and discharge processes in container terminals. Therefore, our model has immense practical value for improving port productivity, as it will contribute to the organization of port operations in a rational, orderly and effective manner.\n\n4. Localization of Relevant Urban Micro-Consolidation Centers for Last-Mile Cargo Bike Delivery Based on Real Demand Data and City Characteristics\nThe use of cargo cycles for last-mile parcel distribution requires urban micro-consolidation centers (UMC). We develop an approach to localize suitable locations for UMCs with the consideration of three criteria: demand, land use, and type of road. The analysis considers metric levels (demand), linguistic levels (land use), and cardinal levels (type of road). The land-use category is divided into commercial, residential, mixed commercial and residential, and others. The type of road category is divided into bicycle road, pedestrian zone, oneway road, and traffic-calmed road. The approach is a hybrid multi-criteria analysis combining an Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and PROMETHEE methods. We apply the approach to the city center of Stuttgart in Germany, using real demand data provided by a large logistics service provider.

Impacts of transport connections on port hinterlands\nABSTRACT This paper examines the spatial distribution of freight flows between the French NUTS-3 regions and West European ports. It focuses on the impacts of the quality of inland and maritime connections on the scope of hinterlands. The results of a spatial interaction analysis reveal that the inland distance constraint is significantly lower when intermodal connections such as regular barge or rail services are available. A case study focused on East Asian trade confirmed that factors related to maritime connectivity, such as the frequency of services at ports and their ability to accommodate large vessels, also contribute to limit the distance impedance. However, these effects vary considerably depending on the value density of the cargo.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In addressing the data analysis task in cargo transportation, the methodologies employed across the five studies reveal a diverse yet complementary approach to optimization and efficiency. The first study conducted a Time Cost Distance Analysis using data from field surveys and in-depth interviews, revealing the efficiency of different land transport routes by considering the impact of border processes on cargo delivery (1). This was complemented by the second paper's use of an optimization weight\u2013TOPSIS combination method, which integrated entropy weighting and a cloud model to select optimal urban oversize cargo transportation routes, addressing the challenges of subjective factors and multiple influencing factors (2). Similarly, the third study contributed to the optimization of intelligent stowage in container ships by constructing a multi-objective integer programming model that balanced container rehandling and yard crane movements, demonstrating the model's effectiveness through case analyses and systematic tests (3). The fourth paper's approach involved a hybrid multi-criteria analysis combining AHP and PROMETHEE methods to localize suitable micro-consolidation centers for last-mile cargo bike delivery, considering demand, land use, and type of road to refine the selection process (4). Lastly, the fifth study applied a spatial interaction analysis to examine the impact of transport connections on port hinterlands, focusing on the role of inland and maritime services in influencing the scope of hinterlands, as evidenced by a case study on East Asian trade (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of data-informed models, optimization techniques, and hybrid analytical frameworks in enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of cargo transportation systems.",

Analysis of the efficiency of land transport connectivity for international trade between Thailand and China\nAbstract This paper aims to analyze the efficiency of land transport connectivity for international trade between Thailand and China, focusing on the 4 main routes (R3A, R8, R9, and R12). The study commenced by taking the data of time, cost, and distance for transportation and border process of general cargo with 40 feet containers collected from field surveys and in-depth interviews of 126 key-informants from the 4 countries involved (Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and China). The data are analyzed, and created the relationship graphics by Time Cost Distance Analysis to evaluate the efficiency of the linkage land transport routes on trade between Thailand and China to identify the bottlenecks/obstacles along the 4 routes. This study will support government agencies in policy decision-making to improve the efficiency of each route. The result found that R9 is the most efficient route due to the low approximate transport cost (3.39 US dollars/km.) and the highest approximate speed (44.52\u2009km./hr.). It is also found that the average Border Process Cost of routes R9, R8, and R12 is approximately 40% of the Total Cost, while the average Border Process Time of each route is approximately 16\u201325% of the Total Time, which shows that the border process cost and time of each route is quite high compared to operations along the route. Therefore, the government agencies of these 4 countries should jointly formulate policies related to the Border Process in order to develop more efficient land transport connectivity for Thailand and China\u2019s international trade.\n\n2. An Optimization Route Selection Method of Urban Oversize Cargo Transportation\nIn order to select the optimal transportation route among alternative transportation routes more accurately and objectively, the choice of urban oversize cargo transportation routes was studied by taking the optimization weight\u2013TOPSIS combination method for specific calculations. This model, based on an entropy weight method, cloud model, and TOPSIS method, combines the superiority of the cloud model for reflecting the randomness and discreteness of subjective evaluation with the advantages of the TOPSIS method in dealing with the problem of multi-objective programming. Through selecting and classifying several the main road influencing factors of urban oversize cargo transportation, based on the data of four urban roads, the entropy weight method is used to initially determine the weights of each influencing factor, the cloud model is used to optimize weights, the TOPSIS method is used to compare and evaluate the paths, and the optimal transportation route is selected on this basis. The results showed that the optimization weight\u2013TOPSIS method is scientific and accurate for the multi-objective planning of oversize cargo transportation route selection, and solves the problem of the impact of subjective factors in existing methods and the difficulty of processing multiple influencing factors. The Pearson consistency test results show that the Pearson correlation coefficient between the proposed method and the actual oversize cargo transportation route selection is 0.995, which is higher than the calculation results without using the combination weight.\n\n3. An AIMMS-based decision-making model for optimizing the intelligent stowage of export containers in a single bay\nStowage operations in container terminals are an important part of a port's operational system, as the quality of stowage operations will directly affect the efficiency of port loading and discharge operations, and the scheduling of container shipping liners. The intelligent stowage of containers in container ships was studied in this work. A multi-objective integer programming model was constructed with the minimization of container rehandling, yard crane movements, and the sum of weight differences between stacked container pairs as its objective functions, to address the need for intelligent optimization of single bay export container stowage on a ship's deck. This model also satisfies the stability requirements of preliminary stowage plans drawn by shipping companies, and the operational requirements of container terminals. Linear computational methods were then constructed to transform non-linear constraints into linear ones for better AIMMS solution. Through numerous case analyses and systematic tests, it was shown that our system is able to rapidly solve for stowage planning optimization problems with complex preliminary stowage data, thus proving the applicability and effectiveness of this model. In particular, the application of this model will simultaneously address the safety of ship voyages, the transportation quality of shipping containers and other forms of cargo, and the cost efficiency of ship operations. In addition, this model will also contribute to the optimization of loading and discharge processes in container terminals. Therefore, our model has immense practical value for improving port productivity, as it will contribute to the organization of port operations in a rational, orderly and effective manner.\n\n4. Localization of Relevant Urban Micro-Consolidation Centers for Last-Mile Cargo Bike Delivery Based on Real Demand Data and City Characteristics\nThe use of cargo cycles for last-mile parcel distribution requires urban micro-consolidation centers (UMC). We develop an approach to localize suitable locations for UMCs with the consideration of three criteria: demand, land use, and type of road. The analysis considers metric levels (demand), linguistic levels (land use), and cardinal levels (type of road). The land-use category is divided into commercial, residential, mixed commercial and residential, and others. The type of road category is divided into bicycle road, pedestrian zone, oneway road, and traffic-calmed road. The approach is a hybrid multi-criteria analysis combining an Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and PROMETHEE methods. We apply the approach to the city center of Stuttgart in Germany, using real demand data provided by a large logistics service provider. We compared different scenarios weighting the criteria differently with DART software. The different weight allocation results in different numbers of required UMCs and slightly different locations. This research was able to develop, implement, and successfully apply the proposed approach. In subsequent steps, stakeholders such as logistics companies and cities should be involved at all levels of this approach to validate the selected criteria and depict the \u201cweight\u201d of each criterion.\n\n5.

        "inference": " The burgeoning field of data analysis for cargo transportation has highlighted several critical aspects of the logistical apparatus supporting global trade. The efficiency of land transport connectivity between Thailand and China, as evaluated through Time Cost Distance Analysis, has been found to be contingent on the optimization of border processes, with a preference for utilizing the shortest and most cost-effective routes to minimize the financial impact on general cargo transport (1). Similarly, the optimization of urban oversize cargo transportation has been advanced as a method for selecting the most scientific and accurate routes, emphasizing the need for a multi-objective approach that incorporates subjective factors without the difficulty of processing multiple influencing factors (2). The intensive study of container stowage on a ship's deck has led to the development of an AIMMS-based decision-making model, which addresses the safety and efficiency of container transportation while optimizing the use of yard cranes and ensuring the satisfaction of both shipping companies and container terminals (3). The localization of urban micro-consolidation centers for last-mile cargo bike delivery has been informed by real demand data and city characteristics, utilizing a hybrid multi-criteria analysis that considers demand, land use, and type of road to identify suitable locations for efficient distribution (4). Lastly, the analysis of transport connections on port hinterlands has revealed the significance of inland and maritime connections in facilitating the flow of freight between regions, with the availability of intermodal services contributing to the reduction of inland distance constraints and the ability of ports to accommodate large vessels influencing the scope of hinterlands (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the multifaceted nature of data analysis in cargo transportation, highlighting the importance of optimizing connectivity, integrating real-time data, and considering the spatial dynamics of hinterlands to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of global logistics.",

Semantic text mining with linked data\nLinked Data is an open data space that emerges from the publication and interlinking of structured data on the Web using the Semantic Web technologies. How to utilize this wealth of data is currently a focused research theme of the Semantic Web community. In this paper, we aim to utilize Linked Data to generate semantic annotations for frequent patterns extracted from textual documents. First, we extract semantic relations from textual documents and merge them into a set of semantic graphs. Then, we apply a frequent subgraph discovery algorithm on the set of graphs to generate frequent patterns. Finally, we annotate the discovered patterns using Linked Data. Our approach can be applied in such domains as terrorist network analysis and biological network analysis. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through an empirical experiment that discovers and validates relationships between political figures from large number of news on the Web.\n\n2. Out of the box: Reasoning with graph convolution nets for factual visual question answering\nAccurately answering a question about a given image requires combining observations with general knowledge. While this is effortless for humans, reasoning with general knowledge remains an algorithmic challenge. To advance research in this direction a novel `fact-based' visual question answering (FVQA) task has been introduced recently along with a large set of curated facts which link two entities, i.e., two possible answers, via a relation. Given a question-image pair, deep network techniques have been employed to successively reduce the large set of facts until one of the two entities of the final remaining fact is predicted as the answer. We observe that a successive process which considers one fact at a time to form a local decision is sub-optimal. Instead, we develop an entity graph and use a graph convolutional network to `reason' about the correct answer by jointly considering all entities. We show on the challenging FVQA dataset that this leads to an improvement in accuracy of around 7% compared to the state of the art.\n\n3. Using linked data to interpret tables\nVast amounts of information is available in structured forms like spreadsheets, database relations, and tables found in documents and on the Web. We describe an approach that uses linked data to interpret such tables and associate their components with nodes in a reference linked data collection. Our proposed framework assigns a class (i.e. type) to table columns, links table cells to entities, and inferred relations between columns to properties. The resulting interpretation can be used to annotate tables, confirm existing facts in the linked data collection, and propose new facts to be added. Our implemented prototype uses DBpedia as the linked data collection and Wikitology for background knowledge. We evaluated its performance using a collection of tables from Google Squared, Wikipedia and the Web.\n\n4. Knowledge-based interactive postmining of association rules using ontologies\nIn Data Mining, the usefulness of association rules is strongly limited by the huge amount of delivered rules. To overcome this drawback, several methods were proposed in the literature such as itemset concise representations, redundancy reduction, and postprocessing. However, being generally based on statistical information, most of these methods do not guarantee that the extracted rules are interesting for the user. Thus, it is crucial to help the decision-maker with an efficient postprocessing step in order to reduce the number of rules. This paper proposes a new interactive approach to prune and filter discovered rules. First, we propose to use ontologies in order to improve the integration of user knowledge in the postprocessing task. Second, we propose the Rule Schema formalism extending the specification language proposed by Liu et al. for user expectations. Furthermore, an interactive framework is designed to assist the user throughout the analyzing task. Applying our new approach over voluminous sets of rules, we were able, by integrating domain expert knowledge in the postprocessing step, to reduce the number of rules to several dozens or less. Moreover, the quality of the filtered rules was validated by the domain expert at various points in the interactive process.\n\n5. Explod: a framework for explaining recommendations based on the linked open data cloud\nIn this paper we present ExpLOD, a framework which exploits the information available in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud to generate a natural language explanation of the suggestions produced by a recommendation algorithm. The methodology is based on building a graph in which the items liked by a user are connected to the items recommended through the properties available in the LOD cloud. Next, given this graph, we implemented some techniques to rank those properties and we used the most relevant ones to feed a module for generating explanations in natural language. In the experimental evaluation we performed a user study with 308 subjects aiming to investigate to what extent our explanation framework can lead to more transparent, trustful and engaging recommendations. The preliminary results provided us with encouraging findings, since our algorithm performed better than both a non-personalized explanation baseline and a popularity-based one.\n\n###\n\n",

The approach in (1) utilizes Linked Data to semantically annotate frequent patterns in text, demonstrating its effectiveness in domains such as terrorist and biological network analysis by mining news articles on the Web. Similarly, (2) introduces a `fact-based' visual question answering (FVQA) task, employing graph convolutional networks to reason about the correct answer by considering all entities simultaneously, thereby improving accuracy in question-image pair matching. In the interpretation of structured data, (3) develops a framework that uses linked data to classify table columns, link table cells to entities, and infer relations between columns to properties, which has been evaluated using tables from various online sources. Addressing the issue of rule overload in data mining, (4) proposes an interactive postmining approach that incorporates ontologies to filter and prune rules, thereby focusing on the most interesting ones for the user. Lastly, (5) presents ExpLOD, a framework that explains recommendations by constructing a graph connecting items liked by a user to those recommended using LOD properties, followed by a module that generates natural language explanations, which has shown promising results in user evaluations. Collectively, these methodologies underscore a trend towards integrating semantic knowledge and interactive user input to refine and personalize recommender system outputs (1-5).\n\n",

This additional information is useful for understanding user behavior and designing better user interfaces. We present CTRanker, a novel method for ranking web pages based on click-time information. CTRanker is an extension of the known mathematical storytelling technique, Minimum Bounding Box (MBB) algorithm. MBB produces a set of hyperrectangles that bounds all of the click-through linkage data in a set of web pages. CTRanker extends MBB to rank the pages by calculating a novel click-time feature, the click-time ratio, and using it in a ranker that competes with the original MBB ranker. The click-time ratio is the ratio of the click-time to the duration of the related document. In this study, we show that the click-time ratio is robust to variations in user behavior and page content, and that CTRanker outperforms the original MBB approach in terms of click-through rate and average click-time. In CTRanker's competition with the original MBB approach, the click-through rate increased by an average of 9.26% and the average click-time increased by an average of 14.37% across all of the test cases.\n\n",

The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through an empirical experiment that discovers and validates relationships between political figures from large number of news on the Web.\n\n2. Out of the box: Reasoning with graph convolution nets for factual visual question answering\nAccurately answering a question about a given image requires combining observations with general knowledge. While this is effortless for humans, reasoning with general knowledge remains an algorithmic challenge. To advance research in this direction a novel `fact-based' visual question answering (FVQA) task has been introduced recently along with a large set of curated facts which link two entities, i.e., two possible answers, via a relation. Given a question-image pair, deep network techniques have been employed to successively reduce the large set of facts until one of the two entities of the final remaining fact is predicted as the answer. We observe that a successive process which considers one fact at a time to form a local decision is sub-optimal. Instead, we develop an entity graph and use a graph convolutional network to `reason' about the correct answer by jointly considering all entities. We show on the challenging FVQA dataset that this leads to an improvement in accuracy of around 7% compared to the state of the art.\n\n3. Using linked data to interpret tables\nVast amounts of information is available in structured forms like spreadsheets, database relations, and tables found in documents and on the Web. We describe an approach that uses linked data to interpret such tables and associate their components with nodes in a reference linked data collection. Our proposed framework assigns a class (i.e. type) to table columns, links table cells to entities, and inferred relations between columns to properties. The resulting interpretation can be used to annotate tables, confirm existing facts in the linked data collection, and propose new facts to be added. Our implemented prototype uses DBpedia as the linked data collection and Wikitology for background knowledge. We evaluated its performance using a collection of tables from Google Squared, Wikipedia and the Web.\n\n4. Knowledge-based interactive postmining of association rules using ontologies\nIn Data Mining, the usefulness of association rules is strongly limited by the huge amount of delivered rules. To overcome this drawback, several methods were proposed in the literature such as itemset concise representations, redundancy reduction, and postprocessing. However, being generally based on statistical information, most of these methods do not guarantee that the extracted rules are interesting for the user. Thus, it is crucial to help the decision-maker with an efficient postprocessing step in order to reduce the number of rules. This paper proposes a new interactive approach to prune and filter discovered rules. First, we propose to use ontologies in order to improve the integration of user knowledge in the postprocessing task. Second, we propose the Rule Schema formalism extending the specification language proposed by Liu et al. for user expectations. Furthermore, an interactive framework is designed to assist the user throughout the analyzing task. Applying our new approach over voluminous sets of rules, we were able, by integrating domain expert knowledge in the postprocessing step, to reduce the number of rules to several dozens or less. Moreover, the quality of the filtered rules was validated by the domain expert at various points in the interactive process.\n\n5. Explod: a framework for explaining recommendations based on the linked open data cloud\nIn this paper we present ExpLOD, a framework which exploits the information available in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud to generate a natural language explanation of the suggestions produced by a recommendation algorithm. The methodology is based on building a graph in which the items liked by a user are connected to the items recommended through the properties available in the LOD cloud. Next, given this graph, we implemented some techniques to rank those properties and we used the most relevant ones to feed a module for generating explanations in natural language. In the experimental evaluation we performed a user study with 308 subjects aiming to investigate to what extent our explanation framework can lead to more transparent, trustful and engaging recommendations. The preliminary results provided us with encouraging findings, since our algorithm performed better than both a non-personalized explanation baseline and a popularity-based one.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of recommender systems, the integration of Linked Data and semantic technologies has shown significant advancements. The first paper presents a novel approach that leverages Linked Data to semantically annotate frequent patterns in textual documents, demonstrating its efficacy in terrorist and biological network analysis by discovering and validating political relations in news articles (1). The second paper shifts focus to visual question answering, where a graph convolutional network is employed to reason about the answers in visual queries, leading to a 7% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods on a fact-based visual question answering dataset (2). The third paper utilizes Linked Data to interpret and enrich structured information found in tables, assigning column types and linking cells to entities, thereby enhancing the annotation of tables and the confirmation of facts in linked data collections (3). Addressing the abundance of rules in data mining, the fourth paper proposes an interactive, knowledge-based postmining framework that incorporates user knowledge using ontologies, significantly reducing the number of rules and enhancing their quality (4). Lastly, the fifth paper introduces ExpLOD, a framework that generates natural language explanations for product recommendations by connecting users' liked items with the items recommended through the LOD cloud, showing promise in user studies for its transparency and trustworthiness (5). Together, these studies underscore the potential of integrating large-scale data and advanced reasoning techniques to improve the interpretability and effectiveness of recommender systems.",

Improving sequential recommendation with knowledge-enhanced memory networks\nWith the revival of neural networks, many studies try to adapt powerful sequential neural models, \u0131e Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), to sequential recommendation. RNN-based networks encode historical interaction records into a hidden state vector. Although the state vector is able to encode sequential dependency, it still has limited representation power in capturing complicated user preference. It is difficult to capture fine-grained user preference from the interaction sequence. Furthermore, the latent vector representation is usually hard to understand and explain. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel knowledge enhanced sequential recommender. Our model integrates the RNN-based networks with Key-Value Memory Network (KV-MN). We further incorporate knowledge base (KB) information to enhance the semantic representation of KV-MN. RNN-based models are good at capturing sequential user preference, while knowledge-enhanced KV-MNs are good at capturing attribute-level user preference. By using a hybrid of RNNs and KV-MNs, it is expected to be endowed with both benefits from these two components. The sequential preference representation together with the attribute-level preference representation are combined as the final representation of user preference. With the incorporation of KB information, our model is also highly interpretable. To our knowledge, it is the first time that sequential recommender is integrated with external memories by leveraging large-scale KB information.\n\n2. Semantic explanations of predictions\nThe main objective of explanations is to transmit knowledge to humans. This work proposes to construct informative explanations for predictions made from machine learning models. Motivated by the observations from social sciences, our approach selects data points from the training sample that exhibit special characteristics crucial for explanation, for instance, ones contrastive to the classification prediction and ones representative of the models. Subsequently, semantic concepts are derived from the selected data points through the use of domain ontologies. These concepts are filtered and ranked to produce informative explanations that improves human understanding. The main features of our approach are that (1) knowledge about explanations is captured in the form of ontological concepts, (2) explanations include contrastive evidences in addition to normal evidences, and (3) explanations are user relevant.\n\n3. Interaction Embeddings for Prediction and Explanation in Knowledge Graphs\nKnowledge graph embedding aims to learn distributed representations for entities and relations, and is proven to be effective in many applications. Crossover interactions -- bi-directional effects between entities and relations --- help select related information when predicting a new triple, but haven't been formally discussed before. In this paper, we propose CrossE, a novel knowledge graph embedding which explicitly simulates crossover interactions. It not only learns one general embedding for each entity and relation as most previous methods do, but also generates multiple triple specific embeddings for both of them, named interaction embeddings. We evaluate embeddings on typical link prediction tasks and find that CrossE achieves state-of-the-art results on complex and more challenging datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate embeddings from a new perspective -- giving explanations for predicted triples, which is important for real applications. In this work, an explanation for a triple is regarded as a reliable closed-path between the head and the tail entity. Compared to other baselines, we show experimentally that CrossE, benefiting from interaction embeddings, is more capable of generating reliable explanations to support its predictions.\n\n4. Knowledge-aware autoencoders for explainable recommender systems\nRecommender Systems have been widely used to help users in finding what they are looking for thus tackling the information overload problem. After several years of research and industrial findings looking after better algorithms to improve accuracy and diversity metrics, explanation services for recommendation are gaining momentum as a tool to provide a human-understandable feedback to results computed, in most of the cases, by black-box machine learning techniques. As a matter of fact, explanations may guarantee users satisfaction, trust, and loyalty in a system. In this paper, we evaluate how different information encoded in a Knowledge Graph are perceived by users when they are adopted to show them an explanation. More precisely, we compare how the use of categorical information, factual one or a mixture of them both in building explanations, affect explanatory criteria for a recommender system. Experimental results are validated through an A/B testing platform which uses a recommendation engine based on a Semantics-Aware Autoencoder to build users profiles which are in turn exploited to compute recommendation lists and to provide an explanation.\n\n5. Linked data and online classifications to organise mined patterns in patient data\nIn this paper, we investigate the use of web data resources in medicine, especially through medical classifications made available using the principles of Linked Data, to support the interpretation of patterns mined from patient care trajectories. Interpreting such patterns is naturally a challenge for an analyst, as it requires going through large amounts of results and access to sufficient background knowledge. We employ linked data, especially as exposed through the BioPortal system, to create a navigation structure within the patterns obtained form sequential pattern mining. We show how this approach provides a flexible way to explore data about trajectories of diagnoses and treatments according to different medical classifications.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In addressing the challenges of recommender systems, recent methodologies have leveraged a combination of sequential neural models, knowledge-enhanced memory networks, ontological concepts, and linked data to improve prediction accuracy and provide explanations that are both interpretable and user-relevant. The integration of RNN-based networks with Key-Value Memory Networks (KV-MN) has been proposed to capture both sequential and attribute-level user preferences, enhancing the representation power of latent vector representations (1). Similarly, the use of semantic concepts derived from domain ontologies has been instrumental in constructing informative explanations that include contrastive evidence, thus catering to human understanding (2). The novel CrossE approach has extended this by explicitly simulating crossover interactions within knowledge graphs, generating interaction embeddings that not only facilitate precise predictions but also provide reliable explanations for predicted triples (3). In the realm of explainable recommender systems, knowledge-aware autoencoders have been employed to encode various information from Knowledge Graphs, generating diverse explanations based on user preferences and behavior (4). Lastly, the utilization of linked data, particularly through the BioPortal system, has been shown to organize mined patterns in patient data, employing medical classifications to facilitate the interpretation of complex health trajectories (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore a trend towards more interpretable and sophisticated recommender systems that can cater to user needs and provide meaningful insights.\n\n",

Improving sequential recommendation with knowledge-enhanced memory networks\nWith the revival of neural networks, many studies try to adapt powerful sequential neural models, \u0131e Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), to sequential recommendation. RNN-based networks encode historical interaction records into a hidden state vector. Although the state vector is able to encode sequential dependency, it still has limited representation power in capturing complicated user preference. It is difficult to capture fine-grained user preference from the interaction sequence. Furthermore, the latent vector representation is usually hard to understand and explain. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel knowledge enhanced sequential recommender. Our model integrates the RNN-based networks with Key-Value Memory Network (KV-MN). We further incorporate knowledge base (KB) information to enhance the semantic representation of KV-MN. RNN-based models are good at capturing sequential user preference, while knowledge-enhanced KV-MNs are good at capturing attribute-level user preference. By using a hybrid of RNNs and KV-MNs, it is expected to be endowed with both benefits from these two components. The sequential preference representation together with the attribute-level preference representation are combined as the final representation of user preference. With the incorporation of KB information, our model is also highly interpretable. To our knowledge, it is the first time that sequential recommender is integrated with external memories by leveraging large-scale KB information.\n\n2. Semantic explanations of predictions\nThe main objective of explanations is to transmit knowledge to humans. This work proposes to construct informative explanations for predictions made from machine learning models. Motivated by the observations from social sciences, our approach selects data points from the training sample that exhibit special characteristics crucial for explanation, for instance, ones contrastive to the classification prediction and ones representative of the models. Subsequently, semantic concepts are derived from the selected data points through the use of domain ontologies. These concepts are filtered and ranked to produce informative explanations that improves human understanding. The main features of our approach are that (1) knowledge about explanations is captured in the form of ontological concepts, (2) explanations include contrastive evidences in addition to normal evidences, and (3) explanations are user relevant.\n\n3. Interaction Embeddings for Prediction and Explanation in Knowledge Graphs\nKnowledge graph embedding aims to learn distributed representations for entities and relations, and is proven to be effective in many applications. Crossover interactions -- bi-directional effects between entities and relations --- help select related information when predicting a new triple, but haven't been formally discussed before. In this paper, we propose CrossE, a novel knowledge graph embedding which explicitly simulates crossover interactions. It not only learns one general embedding for each entity and relation as most previous methods do, but also generates multiple triple specific embeddings for both of them, named interaction embeddings. We evaluate embeddings on typical link prediction tasks and find that CrossE achieves state-of-the-art results on complex and more challenging datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate embeddings from a new perspective -- giving explanations for predicted triples, which is important for real applications. In this work, an explanation for a triple is regarded as a reliable closed-path between the head and the tail entity. Compared to other baselines, we show experimentally that CrossE, benefiting from interaction embeddings, is more capable of generating reliable explanations to support its predictions.\n\n4. Knowledge-aware autoencoders for explainable recommender systems\nRecommender Systems have been widely used to help users in finding what they are looking for thus tackling the information overload problem. After several years of research and industrial findings looking after better algorithms to improve accuracy and diversity metrics, explanation services for recommendation are gaining momentum as a tool to provide a human-understandable feedback to results computed, in most of the cases, by black-box machine learning techniques. As a matter of fact, explanations may guarantee users satisfaction, trust, and loyalty in a system. In this paper, we evaluate how different information encoded in a Knowledge Graph are perceived by users when they are adopted to show them an explanation. More precisely, we compare how the use of categorical information, factual one or a mixture of them both in building explanations, affect explanatory criteria for a recommender system. Experimental results are validated through an A/B testing platform which uses a recommendation engine based on a Semantics-Aware Autoencoder to build users profiles which are in turn exploited to compute recommendation lists and to provide an explanation.\n\n5. Linked data and online classifications to organise mined patterns in patient data\nIn this paper, we investigate the use of web data resources in medicine, especially through medical classifications made available using the principles of Linked Data, to support the interpretation of patterns mined from patient care trajectories. Interpreting such patterns is naturally a challenge for an analyst, as it requires going through large amounts of results and access to sufficient background knowledge. We employ linked data, especially as exposed through the BioPortal system, to create a navigation structure within the patterns obtained form sequential pattern mining. We show how this approach provides a flexible way to explore data about trajectories of diagnoses and treatments according to different medical classifications.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of recommender systems, the integration of knowledge-enhanced memory networks and knowledge base information has significantly advanced the field by improving sequential recommendations and their interpretability. The first paper introduces a novel model that combines RNN-based networks with Key-Value Memory Networks (KV-MNs), incorporating knowledge base (KB) information to enhance semantic representation, thereby capturing both sequential and attribute-level user preferences (1). The second paper shifts focus to the generation of semantic explanations for model predictions, proposing an approach that selects distinctive data points from the training sample and derives semantic concepts through domain ontologies, which are then filtered and ranked to produce user-relevant explanations (2). The third paper, CrossE, explores the concept of crossover interactions in knowledge graph embedding, suggesting that by learning interaction embeddings, it can achieve state-of-the-art results in link prediction tasks and provide reliable explanations for predicted triples (3). Fourthly, the exploration of explainable recommender systems through knowledge-aware autoencoders is examined, where the paper compares the perception of different types of information encoded in a Knowledge Graph on user understanding, demonstrating the effectiveness of semantics-aware autoencoders in generating explanations (4). Lastly, the fifth paper investigates the use of linked data and online classifications in organizing mined patterns in patient data, employing the BioPortal system to provide a navigation structure within patterns, thus facilitating the interpretation of medical trajectories for analysts (5). Together, these studies underscore the transformative potential of integrating external knowledge and advanced machine learning techniques in enhancing the performance and explainability of recommender systems.\n\n",

Knowledgeable reader: Enhancing cloze-style read- ing comprehension with external commonsense knowledge\nWe introduce a neural reading comprehension model that integrates external commonsense knowledge, encoded as a key-value memory, in a cloze-style setting. Instead of relying only on document-to-question interaction or discrete features as in prior work, our model attends to relevant external knowledge and combines this knowledge with the context representation before inferring the answer. This allows the model to attract and imply knowledge from an external knowledge source that is not explicitly stated in the text, but that is relevant for inferring the answer. Our model improves results over a very strong baseline on a hard Common Nouns dataset, making it a strong competitor of much more complex models. By including knowledge explicitly, our model can also provide evidence about the background knowledge used in the RC process.\n\n3. Learning heterogeneous knowledge base embeddings for explainable recommendation\nProviding model-generated explanations in recommender systems is important to user experience. State-of-the-art recommendation algorithms\u2014especially the collaborative filtering (CF)- based approaches with shallow or deep models\u2014usually work with various unstructured information sources for recommendation, such as textual reviews, visual images, and various implicit or explicit feedbacks. Though structured knowledge bases were considered in content-based approaches, they have been largely ignored recently due to the availability of vast amounts of data and the learning power of many complex models. However, structured knowledge bases exhibit unique advantages in personalized recommendation systems. When the explicit knowledge about users and items is considered for recommendation, the system could provide highly customized recommendations based on users\u2019 historical behaviors and the knowledge is helpful for providing informed explanations regarding the recommended items. A great challenge for using knowledge bases for recommendation is how to integrate large-scale structured and unstructured data, while taking advantage of collaborative filtering for highly accurate performance. Recent achievements in knowledge-base embedding (KBE) sheds light on this problem, which makes it possible to learn user and item representations while preserving the structure of their relationship with external knowledge for explanation. In this work, we propose to explain knowledge-base embeddings for explainable recommendation. Specifically, we propose a knowledge-base representation learning framework to embed heterogeneous entities for recommendation, and based on the embedded knowledge base, a soft matching algorithm is proposed to generate personalized explanations for the recommended items. Experimental results on real-world e-commerce datasets verified the superior recommendation performance and the explainability power of our approach compared with state-of-the-art baselines.\n\n4. Knowledge engineering tools for reasoning with scientific observations and interpretations: a neural connectivity use case\nAbstract  Background We address the goal of curating observations from published experiments in a generalizable form; reasoning over these observations to generate interpretations and then querying this interpreted knowledge to supply the supporting evidence. We present web-application software as part of the 'BioScholar' project (R01-GM083871) that fully instantiates this process for a well-defined domain: using tract-tracing experiments to study the neural connectivity of the rat brain.   Results The main contribution of this work is to provide the first instantiation of a knowledge representation for experimental observations called 'Knowledge Engineering from Experimental Design' (KEfED) based on experimental variables and their interdependencies. The software has three parts: (a) the KEfED model editor - a design editor for creating KEfED models by drawing a flow diagram of an experimental protocol; (b) the KEfED data interface - a spreadsheet-like tool that permits users to enter experimental data pertaining to a specific model; (c) a 'neural connection matrix' interface that presents neural connectivity as a table of ordinal connection strengths representing the interpretations of tract-tracing data. This tool also allows the user to view experimental evidence pertaining to a specific connection. BioScholar is built in Flex 3.5. It uses Persevere (a noSQL database) as a flexible data store and PowerLoom\u00ae (a mature First Order Logic reasoning system) to execute queries using spatial reasoning over the BAMS neuroanatomical ontology.   Conclusions We first introduce the KEfED approach as a general approach and describe its possible role as a way of introducing structured reasoning into models of argumentation within new models of scientific publication. We then describe the design and implementation of our example application: the BioScholar software. This is presented as a possible biocuration interface and supplementary reasoning toolkit for a larger, more specialized bioinformatics system: the Brain Architecture Management System (BAMS).\n\n5. Answering science exam questions using query reformulation with background knowledge\nOpen-domain question answering (QA) is an important problem in AI and NLP that is emerging as a bellwether for progress on the generalizability of AI methods and techniques. Much of the progress in open-domain QA systems has been realized through advances in information retrieval methods and corpus construction. In this paper, we focus on the recently introduced ARC Challenge dataset, which contains 2,590 multiple choice questions authored for grade-school science exams. These questions are selected to be the most challenging for current QA systems, and current state of the art performance is only slightly better than random chance. We present a system that reformulates a given question into queries that are used to retrieve supporting text from a large corpus of science-related text. Our rewriter is able to incorporate background knowledge from ConceptNet and -- in tandem with a generic textual entailment system trained on SciTail that identifies support in the retrieved results -- outperforms several strong baselines on the end-to-end QA task despite only being trained to identify essential terms in the original source question. We use a generalizable decision methodology over the retrieved evidence and answer candidates to select the best answer. By combining query reformulation, background knowledge, and textual entailment our system is able to outperform several strong baselines on the ARC dataset.\n\n###\n\n",

Experimental results on real-world e-commerce datasets verified the superior recommendation performance and the explainability power of our approach compared with state-of-the-art baselines.\n\n4. Knowledge engineering tools for reasoning with scientific observations and interpretations: a neural connectivity use case\nAbstract  Background We address the goal of curating observations from published experiments in a generalizable form; reasoning over these observations to generate interpretations and then querying this interpreted knowledge to supply the supporting evidence. We present web-application software as part of the 'BioScholar' project (R01-GM083871) that fully instantiates this process for a well-defined domain: using tract-tracing experiments to study the neural connectivity of the rat brain.   Results The main contribution of this work is to provide the first instantiation of a knowledge representation for experimental observations called 'Knowledge Engineering from Experimental Design' (KEfED) based on experimental variables and their interdependencies. The software has three parts: (a) the KEfED model editor - a design editor for creating KEfED models by drawing a flow diagram of an experimental protocol; (b) the KEfED data interface - a spreadsheet-like tool that permits users to enter experimental data pertaining to a specific model; (c) a 'neural connection matrix' interface that presents neural connectivity as a table of ordinal connection strengths representing the interpretations of tract-tracing data. This tool also allows the user to view experimental evidence pertaining to a specific connection. BioScholar is built in Flex 3.5. It uses Persevere (a noSQL database) as a flexible data store and PowerLoom\u00ae (a mature First Order Logic reasoning system) to execute queries using spatial reasoning over the BAMS neuroanatomical ontology.   Conclusions We first introduce the KEfED approach as a general approach and describe its possible role as a way of introducing structured reasoning into models of argumentation within new models of scientific publication. We then describe the design and implementation of our example application: the BioScholar software. This is presented as a possible biocuration interface and supplementary reasoning toolkit for a larger, more specialized bioinformatics system: the Brain Architecture Management System (BAMS).\n\n5. Answering science exam questions using query reformulation with background knowledge\nOpen-domain question answering (QA) is an important problem in AI and NLP that is emerging as a bellwether for progress on the generalizability of AI methods and techniques. Much of the progress in open-domain QA systems has been realized through advances in information retrieval methods and corpus construction. In this paper, we focus on the recently introduced ARC Challenge dataset, which contains 2,590 multiple choice questions authored for grade-school science exams. These questions are selected to be the most challenging for current QA systems, and current state of the art performance is only slightly better than random chance. We present a system that reformulates a given question into queries that are used to retrieve supporting text from a large corpus of science-related text. Our rewriter is able to incorporate background knowledge from ConceptNet and -- in tandem with a generic textual entailment system trained on SciTail that identifies support in the retrieved results -- outperforms several strong baselines on the end-to-end QA task despite only being trained to identify essential terms in the original source question. We use a generalizable decision methodology over the retrieved evidence and answer candidates to select the best answer. By combining query reformulation, background knowledge, and textual entailment our system is able to outperform several strong baselines on the ARC dataset.\n\n###\n\n",

Knowledgeable reader: Enhancing cloze-style read- ing comprehension with external commonsense knowledge\nWe introduce a neural reading comprehension model that integrates external commonsense knowledge, encoded as a key-value memory, in a cloze-style setting. Instead of relying only on document-to-question interaction or discrete features as in prior work, our model attends to relevant external knowledge and combines this knowledge with the context representation before inferring the answer. This allows the model to attract and imply knowledge from an external knowledge source that is not explicitly stated in the text, but that is relevant for inferring the answer. Our model improves results over a very strong baseline on a hard Common Nouns dataset, making it a strong competitor of much more complex models. By including knowledge explicitly, our model can also provide evidence about the background knowledge used in the RC process.\n\n3. Learning heterogeneous knowledge base embeddings for explainable recommendation\nProviding model-generated explanations in recommender systems is important to user experience. State-of-the-art recommendation algorithms\u2014especially the collaborative filtering (CF)- based approaches with shallow or deep models\u2014usually work with various unstructured information sources for recommendation, such as textual reviews, visual images, and various implicit or explicit feedbacks. Though structured knowledge bases were considered in content-based approaches, they have been largely ignored recently due to the availability of vast amounts of data and the learning power of many complex models. However, structured knowledge bases exhibit unique advantages in personalized recommendation systems. When the explicit knowledge about users and items is considered for recommendation, the system could provide highly customized recommendations based on users\u2019 historical behaviors and the knowledge is helpful for providing informed explanations regarding the recommended items. A great challenge for using knowledge bases for recommendation is how to integrate large-scale structured and unstructured data, while taking advantage of collaborative filtering for highly accurate performance. Recent achievements in knowledge-base embedding (KBE) sheds light on this problem, which makes it possible to learn user and item representations while preserving the structure of their relationship with external knowledge for explanation. In this work, we propose to explain knowledge-base embeddings for explainable recommendation. Specifically, we propose a knowledge-base representation learning framework to embed heterogeneous entities for recommendation, and based on the embedded knowledge base, a soft matching algorithm is proposed to generate personalized explanations for the recommended items. Experimental results on real-world e-commerce datasets verified the superior recommendation performance and the explainability power of our approach compared with state-of-the-art baselines.\n\n4.

Out of the box: Reasoning with graph convolution nets for factual visual question answering\nAccurately answering a question about a given image requires combining observations with general knowledge. While this is effortless for humans, reasoning with general knowledge remains an algorithmic challenge. To advance research in this direction a novel `fact-based' visual question answering (FVQA) task has been introduced recently along with a large set of curated facts which link two entities, i.e., two possible answers, via a relation. Given a question-image pair, deep network techniques have been employed to successively reduce the large set of facts until one of the two entities of the final remaining fact is predicted as the answer. We observe that a successive process which considers one fact at a time to form a local decision is sub-optimal. Instead, we develop an entity graph and use a graph convolutional network to `reason' about the correct answer by jointly considering all entities. We show on the challenging FVQA dataset that this leads to an improvement in accuracy of around 7% compared to the state of the art.\n\n4. Using taxonomies to facilitate the analysis of the association rules\nThe Data Mining process enables the end users to analyze, understand and use the extracted knowledge in an intelligent system or to support in the decision-making processes. However, many algorithms used in the process encounter large quantities of patterns, complicating the analysis of the patterns. This fact occurs with association rules, a Data Mining technique that tries to identify intrinsic patterns in large data sets. A method that can help the analysis of the association rules is the use of taxonomies in the step of post-processing knowledge. In this paper, the GART algorithm is proposed, which uses taxonomies to generalize association rules, and the RulEE-GAR computational module, that enables the analysis of the generalized rules.\n\n5. How a general-purpose common- sense ontology can improve performance of learning-based image retrieval\nThe knowledge representation community has built general-purpose ontologies which contain large amounts of commonsense knowledge over relevant aspects of the world, including useful visual information, e.g.: \"a ball is used by a football player\", \"a tennis player is located at a tennis court\". Current state-of-the-art approaches for visual recognition do not exploit these rule-based knowledge sources. Instead, they learn recognition models directly from training examples. In this paper, we study how general-purpose ontologies\u2014specifically, MIT's ConceptNet ontology\u2014can improve the performance of state-of-the-art vision systems. As a testbed, we tackle the problem of sentence-based image retrieval. Our retrieval approach incorporates knowledge from ConceptNet on top of a large pool of object detectors derived from a deep learning technique. In our experiments, we show that ConceptNet can improve performance on a common benchmark dataset. Key to our performance is the use of the ESPGAME dataset to select visually relevant relations from ConceptNet. Consequently, a main conclusion of this work is that general-purpose commonsense ontologies improve performance on visual reasoning tasks when properly filtered to select meaningful visual relations.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of rule-based machine learning, methodologies vary but share a common goal of integrating knowledge representation with learning tasks to enhance performance. The symbolic approach in (1) focuses on explaining image classification errors by linking them to missed connections in the input data, demonstrating the utility of rules in refining error analysis. Similarly, (2) leverages knowledge graphs to enrich the understanding of images, specifically by linking ImageNet WordNet synsets with Wikidata items, thereby augmenting deep learning with multilingual knowledge. This approach highlights the value of knowledge graphs in real-time image classification. In (3), a graph convolutional network is employed to reason about the answer in visual question answering tasks, moving beyond serial reduction of facts to consider all entities simultaneously, which has been shown to improve accuracy in the FVQA dataset. The GART algorithm in (4) uses taxonomies to generalize association rules, providing a post-processing method to facilitate the analysis of large pattern sets. Lastly, (5) explores the integration of general-purpose ontologies, such as MIT's ConceptNet, with deep learning techniques for sentence-based image retrieval, selecting visually relevant relations from the ontology to improve performance on benchmark datasets.

Out of the box: Reasoning with graph convolution nets for factual visual question answering\nAccurately answering a question about a given image requires combining observations with general knowledge. While this is effortless for humans, reasoning with general knowledge remains an algorithmic challenge. To advance research in this direction a novel `fact-based' visual question answering (FVQA) task has been introduced recently along with a large set of curated facts which link two entities, i.e., two possible answers, via a relation. Given a question-image pair, deep network techniques have been employed to successively reduce the large set of facts until one of the two entities of the final remaining fact is predicted as the answer. We observe that a successive process which considers one fact at a time to form a local decision is sub-optimal. Instead, we develop an entity graph and use a graph convolutional network to `reason' about the correct answer by jointly considering all entities. We show on the challenging FVQA dataset that this leads to an improvement in accuracy of around 7% compared to the state of the art.\n\n4. Using taxonomies to facilitate the analysis of the association rules\nThe Data Mining process enables the end users to analyze, understand and use the extracted knowledge in an intelligent system or to support in the decision-making processes. However, many algorithms used in the process encounter large quantities of patterns, complicating the analysis of the patterns. This fact occurs with association rules, a Data Mining technique that tries to identify intrinsic patterns in large data sets. A method that can help the analysis of the association rules is the use of taxonomies in the step of post-processing knowledge. In this paper, the GART algorithm is proposed, which uses taxonomies to generalize association rules, and the RulEE-GAR computational module, that enables the analysis of the generalized rules.\n\n5. How a general-purpose common- sense ontology can improve performance of learning-based image retrieval\nThe knowledge representation community has built general-purpose ontologies which contain large amounts of commonsense knowledge over relevant aspects of the world, including useful visual information, e.g.: \"a ball is used by a football player\", \"a tennis player is located at a tennis court\". Current state-of-the-art approaches for visual recognition do not exploit these rule-based knowledge sources. Instead, they learn recognition models directly from training examples. In this paper, we study how general-purpose ontologies\u2014specifically, MIT's ConceptNet ontology\u2014can improve the performance of state-of-the-art vision systems. As a testbed, we tackle the problem of sentence-based image retrieval. Our retrieval approach incorporates knowledge from ConceptNet on top of a large pool of object detectors derived from a deep learning technique. In our experiments, we show that ConceptNet can improve performance on a common benchmark dataset. Key to our performance is the use of the ESPGAME dataset to select visually relevant relations from ConceptNet. Consequently, a main conclusion of this work is that general-purpose commonsense ontologies improve performance on visual reasoning tasks when properly filtered to select meaningful visual relations.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " Recent advancements in rule-based machine learning have demonstrated the significance of integrating knowledge graphs and taxonomies to enhance the accuracy and utility of machine learning algorithms across various applications. In the realm of computer vision, the incorporation of general-purpose ontologies such as ConceptNet has been shown to improve image retrieval tasks by capturing commonsense relations between visual elements, thereby outperforming learning-based approaches that rely solely on training examples (5). Similarly, the linkage of ImageNet WordNet synsets with Wikidata has the potential to enrich deep learning algorithms with multilingual knowledge, facilitating real-time image classification and labeling in non-English languages, thus broadening the scope of applications that can benefit from such knowledge graphs (2). Moreover, the use of taxonomies, like the GART algorithm, has been proposed to simplify the analysis of association rules, a Data Mining technique, by generalizing patterns, which aids in the decision-making process (4). In the context of natural language processing, the reasoning with graph convolution nets has been employed to enhance factual visual question answering, demonstrating an improvement in accuracy by considering all entities jointly rather than sequentially (3). These studies collectively underscore the value of leveraging symbolic approaches and knowledge graphs to refine the performance of machine learning systems, indicating a trend towards more intellectually nuanced machine learning paradigms (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n\n",

Research Notes: Smart City Control Room Dashboards: Big Data Infrastructure, from data to decision support\nSmart City Control Rooms are mainly focused on Dashboards which are in turn created by using the socalled Dashboard Builders tools or generated custom. For a city the production of Dashboards is not something that is performed once forever, and it is a continuous working task for improving city monitoring, to follow extraordinary events and/or activities, to monitor critical conditions and cases. Thus, relevant complexities are due to the data aggregation architecture and to the identification of modalities to present data and their identification, prediction, etc., to arrive at producing high level representations that can be used by decision makers. In this paper, the architecture of a Dashboard Builder for creating Smart City Control Rooms is presented. As a validation and test, it has been adopted for generating the dashboards in Florence city and other cities in Tuscany area. The solution proposed has been developed in the context of REPLICATE H2020 European Commission Flagship project on Smart City and Communities.\n\n2. ISO-Standardized Smart City Platform Architecture and Dashboard\nA concept guided by the ISO 37120 standard for city services and quality of life is suggested as unified framework for smart city dashboards. The slow (annual, quarterly, or monthly) ISO 37120 indicators are enhanced and complemented with more detailed and person-centric indicators that can further accelerate the transition toward smart cities. The architecture supports three tasks: acquire and manage data from heterogeneous sensors; process data originated from heterogeneous sources (sensors, OpenData, social data, blogs, news, and so on); and implement such collection and processing on the cloud. A prototype application based on the proposed architecture concept is developed for the city of Skopje, Macedonia. This article is part of a special issue on smart cities.\n\n3. Cities-Board: A Framework to Automate the Development of Smart Cities Dashboards\nSmart cities\u2019 authorities use graphic dashboards to visualize and analyze important information on cities, citizens, institutions, and their interactions. This information supports various decision-making processes that affect citizens\u2019 quality of life. Cities across the world have similar, if not the same, functional and nonfunctional requirements to develop their dashboards. Software developers will face the same challenges and they are likely to provide similar solutions for each developed city dashboard. Moreover, the development of these dashboards implies a significant investment in terms of human and financial resources from cities. The automation of the development of smart cities dashboards is feasible as these visualization systems will have common requirements between cities. This article introduces cities-board, a framework to automate the development of smart cities dashboards based on model-driven engineering. Cities-board proposes a graphic domain-specific language (DSL) that allows the creation of dashboard models with concepts that are closer to city authorities. Cities-board transforms these dashboards models to functional code artifacts by using model-to-model (M2M) and model-to-text (M2T) transformations. We evaluate cities-board by measuring the generation time, and the quality of the generated code under different models configurations. Results show the strengths and weaknesses of cities-board compared against a generic code generation tool.\n\n4. THE DUBLIN DASHBOARD: DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF A REAL-TIME\nANALYTICAL URBAN DASHBOARD\nAbstract. As many cities increase in size across multiple dimensions such as population, economic output and physical size, new methods for understanding and managing cities are required. Data produced by and about urban environments offer insight into what is happening in cities. Real-time data from sensors within the city record current transport and environmental conditions such as noise levels, water levels, journey times and public transport delays. Similarly administrative data such as demographics, employment statistics, property prices and crime rates all provide insight into how a city is evolving. Traditionally, these data were maintained separately and managed by individual city departments. Advances in technology and a move to open-government have placed many of these data in the public domain. Urban dashboards have emerged as a technique to visualise these data in an accessible way. This paper describes the implementation of one such dashboard, the Dublin Dashboard, an interactive website which collects, analyses and visualises data from a variety of sources about Dublin in Ireland through a series of interactive maps, graphs and applications. This paper describes the approach, the data and the technology used to develop the Dublin Dashboard and acts as a guideline for developing urban dashboards in other cities.\n\n5. A Smart City Dashboard for Combining and Analysing Multi-source Data Streams\nSmart city projects are making available numerous, diverse, potentially valuable data streams. However, it is cumbersome and laborious for domain experts to identify, analyse and inter-relate such streams. In this paper we describe a system that is designed to support these users to obtain an understanding of key features of individual streams, and to undertake a variety of analyses that inter-relate multiple streams. Three case studies are presented, showing the use of the system to process live car-park, weather, building energy consumption and bicycle journey data from the CityVerve Smart City project in Manchester.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In addressing the research problem of data analysis, the methodologies employed across the five papers demonstrate a convergence towards the development and refinement of smart city dashboards, which serve as focal points for integrating and analyzing diverse data streams. The first paper introduces a Dashboard Builder for Smart City Control Rooms, emphasizing the dynamic nature of data aggregation and the importance of customizing dashboards to meet specific city requirements (1). This is echoed by the second paper, which advocates for a unified framework based on the ISO 37120 standard to standardize smart city dashboards, complementing traditional indicator data with more granular, person-centric information (2). The third paper, cities-board, proposes an automation framework that utilizes model-driven engineering to generate smart city dashboards, streamlining the development process and enhancing interaction with city authorities through a graphic domain-specific language (3). The fourth paper describes the Dublin Dashboard as a real-time analytical tool that synthesizes data from various urban sources, emphasizing the importance of interactive maps and applications in disseminating data to non-technical users (4). Lastly, the fifth paper presents a system for combining and analyzing multi-source data streams, focusing on domain experts' ability to undertake complex analyses and identify key features within individual data streams (5).

Research Notes: Smart City Control Room Dashboards: Big Data Infrastructure, from data to decision support\nSmart City Control Rooms are mainly focused on Dashboards which are in turn created by using the socalled Dashboard Builders tools or generated custom. For a city the production of Dashboards is not something that is performed once forever, and it is a continuous working task for improving city monitoring, to follow extraordinary events and/or activities, to monitor critical conditions and cases. Thus, relevant complexities are due to the data aggregation architecture and to the identification of modalities to present data and their identification, prediction, etc., to arrive at producing high level representations that can be used by decision makers. In this paper, the architecture of a Dashboard Builder for creating Smart City Control Rooms is presented. As a validation and test, it has been adopted for generating the dashboards in Florence city and other cities in Tuscany area. The solution proposed has been developed in the context of REPLICATE H2020 European Commission Flagship project on Smart City and Communities.\n\n2. ISO-Standardized Smart City Platform Architecture and Dashboard\nA concept guided by the ISO 37120 standard for city services and quality of life is suggested as unified framework for smart city dashboards. The slow (annual, quarterly, or monthly) ISO 37120 indicators are enhanced and complemented with more detailed and person-centric indicators that can further accelerate the transition toward smart cities. The architecture supports three tasks: acquire and manage data from heterogeneous sensors; process data originated from heterogeneous sources (sensors, OpenData, social data, blogs, news, and so on); and implement such collection and processing on the cloud. A prototype application based on the proposed architecture concept is developed for the city of Skopje, Macedonia. This article is part of a special issue on smart cities.\n\n3. Cities-Board: A Framework to Automate the Development of Smart Cities Dashboards\nSmart cities\u2019 authorities use graphic dashboards to visualize and analyze important information on cities, citizens, institutions, and their interactions. This information supports various decision-making processes that affect citizens\u2019 quality of life. Cities across the world have similar, if not the same, functional and nonfunctional requirements to develop their dashboards. Software developers will face the same challenges and they are likely to provide similar solutions for each developed city dashboard. Moreover, the development of these dashboards implies a significant investment in terms of human and financial resources from cities. The automation of the development of smart cities dashboards is feasible as these visualization systems will have common requirements between cities. This article introduces cities-board, a framework to automate the development of smart cities dashboards based on model-driven engineering. Cities-board proposes a graphic domain-specific language (DSL) that allows the creation of dashboard models with concepts that are closer to city authorities. Cities-board transforms these dashboards models to functional code artifacts by using model-to-model (M2M) and model-to-text (M2T) transformations. We evaluate cities-board by measuring the generation time, and the quality of the generated code under different models configurations. Results show the strengths and weaknesses of cities-board compared against a generic code generation tool.\n\n4. THE DUBLIN DASHBOARD: DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF A REAL-TIME\nANALYTICAL URBAN DASHBOARD\nAbstract. As many cities increase in size across multiple dimensions such as population, economic output and physical size, new methods for understanding and managing cities are required. Data produced by and about urban environments offer insight into what is happening in cities. Real-time data from sensors within the city record current transport and environmental conditions such as noise levels, water levels, journey times and public transport delays. Similarly administrative data such as demographics, employment statistics, property prices and crime rates all provide insight into how a city is evolving. Traditionally, these data were maintained separately and managed by individual city departments. Advances in technology and a move to open-government have placed many of these data in the public domain. Urban dashboards have emerged as a technique to visualise these data in an accessible way. This paper describes the implementation of one such dashboard, the Dublin Dashboard, an interactive website which collects, analyses and visualises data from a variety of sources about Dublin in Ireland through a series of interactive maps, graphs and applications. This paper describes the approach, the data and the technology used to develop the Dublin Dashboard and acts as a guideline for developing urban dashboards in other cities.\n\n5. A Smart City Dashboard for Combining and Analysing Multi-source Data Streams\nSmart city projects are making available numerous, diverse, potentially valuable data streams. However, it is cumbersome and laborious for domain experts to identify, analyse and inter-relate such streams. In this paper we describe a system that is designed to support these users to obtain an understanding of key features of individual streams, and to undertake a variety of analyses that inter-relate multiple streams. Three case studies are presented, showing the use of the system to process live car-park, weather, building energy consumption and bicycle journey data from the CityVerve Smart City project in Manchester.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The synthesis of recent research on data analysis for smart cities highlights the critical role of dashboards in synthesizing and presenting complex data to support decision-making. The development of smart city control rooms relies on advanced data aggregation architectures and custom dashboards, which are continually evolving to accommodate new events and information sources (1). ISO-standardized frameworks, such as the one proposed for Skopje, aim to provide a unified approach to smart city dashboard design, integrating various data sources and enabling personalized indicators to enhance the quality of life (2). The automation of smart city dashboard development is also being explored, with frameworks like cities-board utilizing model-driven engineering to streamline the process, reducing development time and resource investments (3). In practice, the Dublin Dashboard serves as an example of a real-time analytical urban dashboard, combining data from sensors and administrative sources to provide interactive visualizations that aid in urban management (4). Similarly, the integration of multi-source data streams is addressed, with systems designed to facilitate the identification and analysis of disparate data sets, aiding domain experts in unlocking insights and relationships within smart city projects (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the importance of user-centric design, standardization, and automation in the development of effective data analysis tools for the enhancement of urban services and living conditions.\n\n1.

THE DUBLIN DASHBOARD: DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF A REAL-TIME\nANALYTICAL URBAN DASHBOARD\nAbstract. As many cities increase in size across multiple dimensions such as population, economic output and physical size, new methods for understanding and managing cities are required. Data produced by and about urban environments offer insight into what is happening in cities. Real-time data from sensors within the city record current transport and environmental conditions such as noise levels, water levels, journey times and public transport delays. Similarly administrative data such as demographics, employment statistics, property prices and crime rates all provide insight into how a city is evolving. Traditionally, these data were maintained separately and managed by individual city departments. Advances in technology and a move to open-government have placed many of these data in the public domain. Urban dashboards have emerged as a technique to visualise these data in an accessible way. This paper describes the implementation of one such dashboard, the Dublin Dashboard, an interactive website which collects, analyses and visualises data from a variety of sources about Dublin in Ireland through a series of interactive maps, graphs and applications. This paper describes the approach, the data and the technology used to develop the Dublin Dashboard and acts as a guideline for developing urban dashboards in other cities.\n\n2. Research Notes: Smart City Control Room Dashboards: Big Data Infrastructure, from data to decision support\nSmart City Control Rooms are mainly focused on Dashboards which are in turn created by using the socalled Dashboard Builders tools or generated custom. For a city the production of Dashboards is not something that is performed once forever, and it is a continuous working task for improving city monitoring, to follow extraordinary events and/or activities, to monitor critical conditions and cases. Thus, relevant complexities are due to the data aggregation architecture and to the identification of modalities to present data and their identification, prediction, etc., to arrive at producing high level representations that can be used by decision makers. In this paper, the architecture of a Dashboard Builder for creating Smart City Control Rooms is presented. As a validation and test, it has been adopted for generating the dashboards in Florence city and other cities in Tuscany area. The solution proposed has been developed in the context of REPLICATE H2020 European Commission Flagship project on Smart City and Communities.\n\n3. Cities-Board: A Framework to Automate the Development of Smart Cities Dashboards\nSmart cities\u2019 authorities use graphic dashboards to visualize and analyze important information on cities, citizens, institutions, and their interactions. This information supports various decision-making processes that affect citizens\u2019 quality of life. Cities across the world have similar, if not the same, functional and nonfunctional requirements to develop their dashboards. Software developers will face the same challenges and they are likely to provide similar solutions for each developed city dashboard. Moreover, the development of these dashboards implies a significant investment in terms of human and financial resources from cities. The automation of the development of smart cities dashboards is feasible as these visualization systems will have common requirements between cities. This article introduces cities-board, a framework to automate the development of smart cities dashboards based on model-driven engineering.

CityDash: Visualising a Changing City Using Open Data\nIn an increasingly urbanised world, there are pressures being placed on our cities, which planners, decision-makers, and communities need to be able to respond to. Data driven responses and tools that can support the communication of information, and indicators on a city\u2019s performance are becoming increasingly available and have the potential to play a critical role in understanding and managing complex urban systems. In this research, we will review international efforts in the creation of city dashboards and introduce the City of Sydney Dashboard, known as CityDash. This chapter culminates in a number of recommendations for city dashboards\u2019 implementation. The recommendations for city dashboards include: consolidated information on a single web page, live data feeds relevant to planners and decision-makers as well as citizens\u2019 daily lives, and site analytics as a way of evaluating user interactions and preferences\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The methodologies employed in the development of urban dashboards across the studies reflect a convergence towards real-time data analysis and visualization, with an emphasis on integrating diverse data sources and enabling interactive user interactions. The Dublin Dashboard project utilized a comprehensive approach, collecting data from various sensors and administrative sources to create interactive maps and graphs, which were made publicly accessible via a web-based platform (1). Similarly, the Smart City Control Room dashboards described in the second study also emphasized the importance of data aggregation and the need for continuous refinement to meet the demands of real-time monitoring and decision support, employing a Dashboard Builder tool to facilitate the creation of high-level representations from complex datasets (2). The cities-board framework introduced in the third study took a model-driven engineering approach, transforming visual dashboard models into functional code artifacts, thereby automating the development process and addressing the repetitive nature of dashboard creation across smart cities (3). The fourth study suggested an ISO-standardized platform architecture to unify smart city dashboards, focusing on data acquisition, processing, and cloud implementation, with a prototype developed for the city of Skopje (4). Lastly, the CityDash project advocated for open data visualization, highlighting the need for consolidated information and live data feeds to support urban planning and decision-making, with site analytics to evaluate user interactions and preferences (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the critical role of data integrity, standardization, and adaptability in the development of dynamic, user-centric urban dashboards for effective urban management.",

THE DUBLIN DASHBOARD: DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF A REAL-TIME\nANALYTICAL URBAN DASHBOARD\nAbstract. As many cities increase in size across multiple dimensions such as population, economic output and physical size, new methods for understanding and managing cities are required. Data produced by and about urban environments offer insight into what is happening in cities. Real-time data from sensors within the city record current transport and environmental conditions such as noise levels, water levels, journey times and public transport delays. Similarly administrative data such as demographics, employment statistics, property prices and crime rates all provide insight into how a city is evolving. Traditionally, these data were maintained separately and managed by individual city departments. Advances in technology and a move to open-government have placed many of these data in the public domain. Urban dashboards have emerged as a technique to visualise these data in an accessible way. This paper describes the implementation of one such dashboard, the Dublin Dashboard, an interactive website which collects, analyses and visualises data from a variety of sources about Dublin in Ireland through a series of interactive maps, graphs and applications.

Laboratory Astrophysics Survey of Key X\u2010Ray Diagnostic Lines Using A Microcalorimeter on an Electron Beam Ion Trap\nCosmic plasma conditions created in an electron beam ion trap (EBIT) make it possible to simulate the dependencies of key diagnostic X-ray lines on density, temperature, and excitation conditions that exist in astrophysical sources. We used a microcalorimeter for such laboratory astrophysics studies because it has a resolving power \u22481000, quantum efficiency approaching 100%, and a bandwidth that spans the X-ray energies from 0.2 keV to 10 keV. Our microcalorimeter, coupled with an X-ray optic to increase the effective solid angle, provides a significant new capability for laboratory astrophysics measurements. Broadband spectra obtained from the National Institute of Standards and Technology EBIT with an energy resolution approaching that of a Bragg crystal spectrometer are presented for nitrogen, oxygen, neon, argon, and krypton in various stages of ionization. We have compared the measured line intensities to theoretical predictions for an EBIT plasma.\n\n2. Laboratory Data on the EUV/Soft-X-Ray Flux Problem of Fe xviii and Fe xix\nAbstract Observations by the spacecraft Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE), Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE), Chandra, and XMM-Newton of Capella (\u03b1 Aurigae) have encountered problems with the relative intensities of the Fe xviii and Fe xix line emission in the soft-X-ray (XUV) and extreme-ultraviolet spectral ranges versus various model predictions based on theoretical atomic data. The reason may either lie in astrophysical phenomena, e.g., at emission or because of absorption by the interstellar medium, in the theoretical atomic data, in one or more spectrometer calibrations, or in the spectral modeling. By measurements using an electron beam ion trap we provide laboratory data obtained under conditions that are reasonably close to stellar emission regions. The laboratory data on Fe xviii and Fe xix show line ratios that are rather similar to the observations of Capella. The measurements, therefore, rule out astrophysical phenomena and calibration errors and point to issues with the modeling of the observed Capella emission.\n\n3. Laboratory astrophysics and microanalysis with NTD-germanium-based X-ray microcalorimeters\nWith the ability to create cosmic plasma conditions in the laboratory it is possible to investigate the dependencies of key diagnostic X-ray lines on density, temperature, and excitation conditions that exist in astrophysical sources with X-ray optics and a high-resolution X-ray microcalorimeter. The same instrumentation can be coupled to scanning electron microscopes or X-ray fluorescence probes to analyze the elemental and chemical composition of electronic, biological, geological and particulate materials. We describe how our microcalorimeter and X-ray optics provide significantly improved capabilities for laboratory astrophysics and microanalysis\n\n4. Fe XVII X-RAY LINE RATIOS FOR ACCURATE ASTROPHYSICAL PLASMA DIAGNOSTICS\nNew laboratory measurements using an electron beam ion trap and an X-ray microcalorimeter are presented for the n = 3 to n = 2 Fe\u2009xvii emission lines in the 15\u201317 \u00c5 range, along with new theoretical predictions for a variety of electron energy distributions. This work improves upon our earlier work on these lines by providing measurements at more electron-impact energies (seven values from 846 to 1185 eV), performing an in situ determination of the X-ray window transmission, taking steps to minimize the ion impurity concentrations, correcting the electron energies for space charge shifts, and estimating the residual electron energy uncertainties. The results for the 3C/3D and 3s/3C line ratios are generally in agreement with the closest theory to within 10%, and in agreement with previous measurements from an independent group to within 20%. Better consistency between the two experimental groups is obtained at the lowest electron energies by using theory to interpolate, taking into account the significantly different electron energy distributions. Evidence for resonance collision effects in the spectra is discussed. Renormalized values for the absolute cross sections of the 3C and 3D lines are obtained by combining previously published results and shown to be in agreement with the predictions of converged R-matrix theory. This work establishes consistency between results from independent laboratories and improves the reliability of these lines for astrophysical diagnostics. Factors that should be taken into account for accurate diagnostics are discussed, including electron energy distribution, polarization, absorption/scattering, and line blends.\n\n5. Charge Exchange-Induced X-Ray Emission from Comet C/1999 S4 (LINEAR)\nUsing soft x-ray observations of the bright new comet C/1999 S4 (LINEAR) with the Chandra x-ray observatory, we have detected x-ray line emission created by charge exchange between highly ionized solar wind minor ions and neutral gases in the comet's coma. The emission morphology was symmetrically crescent shaped and extended out to 300,000 kilometers from the nucleus. The emission spectrum contains 6 lines at 320, 400, 490, 560, 600, and 670 electron volts, attributable to electron capture and radiative deexcitation by the solar wind species C             +5             , C             +6             , N             +7             , O             +7             , and O             +8             . A contemporaneous 7-day soft x-ray light curve obtained using the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer demonstrates a large increase in the comet's emission coincident with a strong solar flare on 14 and 15 July 2000.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of astrophysics using highly charged ions (HCI), laboratory measurements have been pivotal in understanding the diagnostic capabilities of X-ray spectra from ionized plasmas. Electron beam ion traps (EBITs) have been instrumental in simulating astrophysical conditions within laboratories, allowing for the study of HCI under controlled environments (1). Microcalorimeters attached to EBITs have enhanced this methodology by providing high-resolution, all-in-one spectrometer capabilities, which are crucial for comparing theoretical predictions with observed spectra (1, 3). The use of EBITs has been complemented by measurements on Capella, a star modeled to exhibit similar conditions to those found in astrophysics, to validate the line ratios observed in EUV and soft-X-ray emissions, thereby ruling out errors in astrophysical or calibration phenomena (2). Additionally, the integration of X-ray microcalorimeters with scanning electron microscopes or X-ray fluorescence probes has expanded the application of HCIs in microanalysis, offering improved astrophysical plasma diagnosis (3). Finally, the study of comets has also benefited from the application of HCIs, with the detection of charge exchange-induced X-ray emission providing insights into the interaction of highly ionized solar wind particles with neutral coma gases, as evidenced by the symmetric crescent-shaped morphology observed in comet C/1999 S4 (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of laboratory-based HCI research in advancing the understanding of cosmic plasmas and interstellar conditions as observed in astrophysics.\n\n",

        "inference": " Recent advancements in laboratory astrophysics have demonstrated the pivotal role of highly charged ions (HCIs) in the understanding of astrophysical plasma conditions. The use of microcalorimeters within electron beam ion traps (EBITs) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of simulating the characteristics of HCIs under various conditions, providing insights into the diagnostic capabilities of X-ray lines for determining plasma temperatures and densities (1). This is complemented by measurements of HCI lines, such as Fe xviii and Fe xix, which have revealed discrepancies between laboratory data and astrophysical observations, suggesting the need for a closer examination of astrophysical phenomena and potential errors in spectrometer calibrations (2). Moreover, the combination of EBITs with X-ray optics and microcalorimeters has expanded the scope of microanalysis, allowing for the investigation of elemental and chemical composition in a range of materials (3). Specifically, the study of Fe xvii emission lines has been improved through new laboratory measurements, which, despite some discrepancies, contribute to the refinement of astrophysical plasma diagnostics (4). Finally, the study of cometary X-ray emissions has underscored the importance of charge exchange events in the formation of X-ray lines, offering insights into the complex dynamics of solar wind interactions with astrophysical objects (5).

Laboratory Astrophysics Survey of Key X\u2010Ray Diagnostic Lines Using A Microcalorimeter on an Electron Beam Ion Trap\nCosmic plasma conditions created in an electron beam ion trap (EBIT) make it possible to simulate the dependencies of key diagnostic X-ray lines on density, temperature, and excitation conditions that exist in astrophysical sources. We used a microcalorimeter for such laboratory astrophysics studies because it has a resolving power \u22481000, quantum efficiency approaching 100%, and a bandwidth that spans the X-ray energies from 0.2 keV to 10 keV. Our microcalorimeter, coupled with an X-ray optic to increase the effective solid angle, provides a significant new capability for laboratory astrophysics measurements. Broadband spectra obtained from the National Institute of Standards and Technology EBIT with an energy resolution approaching that of a Bragg crystal spectrometer are presented for nitrogen, oxygen, neon, argon, and krypton in various stages of ionization. We have compared the measured line intensities to theoretical predictions for an EBIT plasma.\n\n2. Laboratory Data on the EUV/Soft-X-Ray Flux Problem of Fe xviii and Fe xix\nAbstract Observations by the spacecraft Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE), Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE), Chandra, and XMM-Newton of Capella (\u03b1 Aurigae) have encountered problems with the relative intensities of the Fe xviii and Fe xix line emission in the soft-X-ray (XUV) and extreme-ultraviolet spectral ranges versus various model predictions based on theoretical atomic data. The reason may either lie in astrophysical phenomena, e.g., at emission or because of absorption by the interstellar medium, in the theoretical atomic data, in one or more spectrometer calibrations, or in the spectral modeling. By measurements using an electron beam ion trap we provide laboratory data obtained under conditions that are reasonably close to stellar emission regions. The laboratory data on Fe xviii and Fe xix show line ratios that are rather similar to the observations of Capella. The measurements, therefore, rule out astrophysical phenomena and calibration errors and point to issues with the modeling of the observed Capella emission.\n\n3. Laboratory astrophysics and microanalysis with NTD-germanium-based X-ray microcalorimeters\nWith the ability to create cosmic plasma conditions in the laboratory it is possible to investigate the dependencies of key diagnostic X-ray lines on density, temperature, and excitation conditions that exist in astrophysical sources with X-ray optics and a high-resolution X-ray microcalorimeter. The same instrumentation can be coupled to scanning electron microscopes or X-ray fluorescence probes to analyze the elemental and chemical composition of electronic, biological, geological and particulate materials. We describe how our microcalorimeter and X-ray optics provide significantly improved capabilities for laboratory astrophysics and microanalysis\n\n4. Fe XVII X-RAY LINE RATIOS FOR ACCURATE ASTROPHYSICAL PLASMA DIAGNOSTICS\nNew laboratory measurements using an electron beam ion trap and an X-ray microcalorimeter are presented for the n = 3 to n = 2 Fe\u2009xvii emission lines in the 15\u201317 \u00c5 range, along with new theoretical predictions for a variety of electron energy distributions. This work improves upon our earlier work on these lines by providing measurements at more electron-impact energies (seven values from 846 to 1185 eV), performing an in situ determination of the X-ray window transmission, taking steps to minimize the ion impurity concentrations, correcting the electron energies for space charge shifts, and estimating the residual electron energy uncertainties. The results for the 3C/3D and 3s/3C line ratios are generally in agreement with the closest theory to within 10%, and in agreement with previous measurements from an independent group to within 20%. Better consistency between the two experimental groups is obtained at the lowest electron energies by using theory to interpolate, taking into account the significantly different electron energy distributions. Evidence for resonance collision effects in the spectra is discussed. Renormalized values for the absolute cross sections of the 3C and 3D lines are obtained by combining previously published results and shown to be in agreement with the predictions of converged R-matrix theory. This work establishes consistency between results from independent laboratories and improves the reliability of these lines for astrophysical diagnostics. Factors that should be taken into account for accurate diagnostics are discussed, including electron energy distribution, polarization, absorption/scattering, and line blends.\n\n5. Charge Exchange-Induced X-Ray Emission from Comet C/1999 S4 (LINEAR)\nUsing soft x-ray observations of the bright new comet C/1999 S4 (LINEAR) with the Chandra x-ray observatory, we have detected x-ray line emission created by charge exchange between highly ionized solar wind minor ions and neutral gases in the comet's coma. The emission morphology was symmetrically crescent shaped and extended out to 300,000 kilometers from the nucleus. The emission spectrum contains 6 lines at 320, 400, 490, 560, 600, and 670 electron volts, attributable to electron capture and radiative deexcitation by the solar wind species C             +5             , C             +6             , N             +7             , O             +7             , and O             +8             . A contemporaneous 7-day soft x-ray light curve obtained using the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer demonstrates a large increase in the comet's emission coincident with a strong solar flare on 14 and 15 July 2000.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of astrophysics, highly charged ions (HCIs) have emerged as a powerful diagnostic tool for probing cosmic conditions. Laboratory-based studies utilizing a microcalorimeter on an electron beam ion trap (EBIT) have advanced the field by providing a high-resolution, quantum-efficient instrument for measuring X-ray lines from various elements, such as nitrogen, oxygen, neon, argon, and krypton under simulated astrophysical conditions (1). These measurements have been instrumental in determining the line intensities for different plasma densities and temperatures, aiding in the understanding of cosmic environments. Moreover, laboratory data on the EUV/Soft-X-Ray flux problem of Fe xviii and Fe xix have revealed discrepancies between observed line ratios and theoretical predictions, suggesting that astrophysical phenomena or issues with theoretical atomic data may be present in space observations, which can now be further investigated using the EBIT-microcalorimeter setup (2). The capability of this instrumentation to not only measure X-ray spectra but also analyze elemental compositions has been demonstrated, with applications extending to electronic, biological, geological, and particulate materials (3). Furthermore, new measurements of Fe xvii X-ray line ratios have been obtained using an EBIT and X-ray microcalorimeter, which, when compared with astronomical observations, indicate the presence of resonance collision effects and highlight the importance of electron energy distributions and transmission for accurate plasma diagnostics (4). Lastly, the detection of X-ray emission from comet C/1999 S4 (LINEAR) has provided insights into charge exchange-induced emissions, enhancing our understanding of interactions between highly charged ions and neutral gases in space, with implications for astrophysical processes (5).

The Presence of Dust and Ice Scattering in X-Ray Emissions from Comets\nX-ray emissions from cometary atmospheres were modeled from first principles using the charge-exchange interaction with solar wind ions as well as coherent scattering of solar X-rays from dust and ice grains. Scattering cross-sections were interpolated over the 1 nm\u20131 cm grain radius range using approximations based on the optically thin or thick nature of grains with different sizes. The theoretical emission model was compared to Chandra observations of Comets ISON and Ikeya\u2013Zhang due to their high signal-to-noise ratios and clearly defined spectral features. Comparing the observed intensities to the model showed that the charge-exchange mechanism accurately reproduced the emission spectra below 1 keV, while dust and ice scattering was negligible. Examining the 1\u20132 keV range found dust and ice scattering emissions to agree well with observations, while charge-exchange contributions were insignificant. Spectral features between the scattering model and observations also trended similarly over the 1\u20132 keV range. The dust and ice density within the cometary atmosphere n was varied with respect to grain size a as the function , with Ikeya\u2013Zhang requiring and ISON requiring to best fit the observed spectral intensities. These grain size dependencies agreed with independent observations and simulations of such systems. The overall findings demonstrate evidence of significant scattering emissions present above 1 keV in the analyzed cometary emission spectra and that the dust/ice density dependence on grain radius a may vary significantly between comets.\n\n2. Spectral analysis of the Chandra comet survey\nAims.We present results of the analysis of cometary X-ray spectra with an extended version of our charge exchange emission model (Bodewits et al. 2006). We have applied this model to the sample of 8 comets thus far observed with the Chandra X-ray observatory and ACIS spectrometer in the 300-1000 eV range. The surveyed comets are C/1999 S4 (LINEAR), C/1999 T1 (McNaught-Hartley), C/2000 WM1 (LINEAR), 153P/2002 (Ikeya-Zhang), 2P/2003 (Encke), C/2001 Q4 (NEAT), 9P/2005 (Tempel 1) and 73P/2006-B (Schwassmann-Wachmann 3) and the observations include a broad variety of comets, solar wind environments and observational conditions. Methods.The interaction model is based on state selective, velocity dependent charge exchange cross sections and is used to explore how cometary X-ray emission depend on cometary, observational and solar wind characteristics. It is further demonstrated that cometary X-ray spectra mainly reflect the state of the local solar wind. The current sample of Chandra observations was fit using the constrains of the charge exchange model, and relative solar wind abundances were derived from the X-ray spectra. Results.Our analysis showed that spectral differences can be ascribed to different solar wind states, as such identifying comets interacting with (I) fast, cold wind, (II), slow, warm wind and (III) disturbed, fast, hot winds associated with interplanetary coronal mass ejections. We furthermore predict the existence of a fourth spectral class, associated with the cool, fast high latitude wind.\n\n3. CHANDRA OBSERVATIONS OF COMETS C/2012 S1 (ISON) AND C/2011 L4 (PanSTARRS)\nWe present our results on the Chandra X-ray Observatory Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) observations of the bright Oort Cloud comets C/2012 S1 (ISON) and C/2011 L4 (PanSTARRS). ISON was observed between 2013 October 31\u2013November 06 during variable speed solar wind (SW), and PanSTARRS was observed between 2013 April 17\u201323 during fast SW. ISON produced an extended parabolic X-ray morphology consistent with a collisionally thick coma, while PanSTARRS demonstrated only a diffuse X-ray-emitting region. We consider these emissions to be from charge exchange (CX) and model each comet's emission spectrum from first principles accordingly. Our model agrees with the observational spectra and also generates composition ratios for heavy, highly charged SW ions interacting with the cometary atmosphere. We compare our derived SW ion compositions to observational data and find a strong agreement between them. These results further demonstrate the utility of CX emissions as a remote diagnostics tool of both astrophysical plasma interaction and SW composition. In addition, we observe potential soft X-ray emissions via ACIS around 0.2 keV from both comets that are correlated in intensity to the hard X-ray emissions between 0.4\u20131.0 keV. We fit our CX model to these emissions, but our lack of a unique solution at low energies makes it impossible to conclude if they are cometary CX in origin. Finally, we discuss probable emission mechanism sources for the soft X-rays and explore new opportunities these findings present in understanding cometary emission processes via Chandra.\n\n4. <i>Chandra</i>Observations of Comet 2P/Encke 2003: First Detection of a Collisionally Thin, Fast Solar Wind Charge Exchange System\nWe report the results of 15 hr of Chandra observations of comet 2P/Encke 2003 on November 24. X-ray emission from comet Encke was resolved on scales of 500-40,000 km, with unusual morphology due to the presence of a low-density, collisionally thin (to charge exchange) coma. A light curve with peak-to-peak amplitude of 20% consistent with a nucleus rotational period of 11.1 hr was found, further evidence for a collisionally thin coma. We confirm emission lines due to oxygen and neon in the 800-1000 eV range but find very unusual oxygen and carbon line ratios in the 200-700 eV range, evidence for low-density, high effective temperature solar wind composition. We compare the X-ray spectral observation results to contemporaneous measurements of the coma and solar wind made by other means and find good evidence for the dominance of a postshock bubble of expanding solar wind plasma, moving at 600 km s-1 with charge state composition between that of the \"fast\" and \"slow\" solar winds.\n\n5.

        "inference": " In the realm of solar system X-ray astronomy, researchers have employed a variety of methodologies to analyze the emissions from celestial objects such as comets. The first study utilized a charge-exchange interaction model with spectral interpolation to compare observed X-ray emissions from comets with predictions from scattering and charge-exchange processes, revealing significant scattering emissions above 1 keV in cometary spectra and variable dust/ice densities with grain size (1). Another research effort extended the charge-exchange emission model to a larger sample of comets, applying it to their X-ray spectra over a broad energy range to identify patterns related to solar wind interactions, thus providing insights into cometary X-ray spectra as indicators of local solar wind conditions (2). Similar analyses on other comets, such as ISON and PanSTARRS, involved the application of charge exchange models to identify emission sources and derive composition ratios for solar wind ions interacting with cometary atmospheres, with results supporting the utility of X-ray emissions as remote diagnostics tools (3, 4). Lastly, the detection of symmetric crescent-shaped X-ray emission morphologies in comets, observed by Chandra, was attributed to charge exchange between highly ionized solar wind minor ions and neutral gases, with the light curve analysis providing information on the temporal evolution of these emissions (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of charge exchange models and their application to X-ray spectroscopy as a key diagnostic tool for understanding solar system dynamics.",

The Presence of Dust and Ice Scattering in X-Ray Emissions from Comets\nX-ray emissions from cometary atmospheres were modeled from first principles using the charge-exchange interaction with solar wind ions as well as coherent scattering of solar X-rays from dust and ice grains. Scattering cross-sections were interpolated over the 1 nm\u20131 cm grain radius range using approximations based on the optically thin or thick nature of grains with different sizes. The theoretical emission model was compared to Chandra observations of Comets ISON and Ikeya\u2013Zhang due to their high signal-to-noise ratios and clearly defined spectral features. Comparing the observed intensities to the model showed that the charge-exchange mechanism accurately reproduced the emission spectra below 1 keV, while dust and ice scattering was negligible. Examining the 1\u20132 keV range found dust and ice scattering emissions to agree well with observations, while charge-exchange contributions were insignificant. Spectral features between the scattering model and observations also trended similarly over the 1\u20132 keV range. The dust and ice density within the cometary atmosphere n was varied with respect to grain size a as the function , with Ikeya\u2013Zhang requiring and ISON requiring to best fit the observed spectral intensities. These grain size dependencies agreed with independent observations and simulations of such systems. The overall findings demonstrate evidence of significant scattering emissions present above 1 keV in the analyzed cometary emission spectra and that the dust/ice density dependence on grain radius a may vary significantly between comets.\n\n2. Spectral analysis of the Chandra comet survey\nAims.We present results of the analysis of cometary X-ray spectra with an extended version of our charge exchange emission model (Bodewits et al. 2006). We have applied this model to the sample of 8 comets thus far observed with the Chandra X-ray observatory and ACIS spectrometer in the 300-1000 eV range. The surveyed comets are C/1999 S4 (LINEAR), C/1999 T1 (McNaught-Hartley), C/2000 WM1 (LINEAR), 153P/2002 (Ikeya-Zhang), 2P/2003 (Encke), C/2001 Q4 (NEAT), 9P/2005 (Tempel 1) and 73P/2006-B (Schwassmann-Wachmann 3) and the observations include a broad variety of comets, solar wind environments and observational conditions. Methods.The interaction model is based on state selective, velocity dependent charge exchange cross sections and is used to explore how cometary X-ray emission depend on cometary, observational and solar wind characteristics. It is further demonstrated that cometary X-ray spectra mainly reflect the state of the local solar wind. The current sample of Chandra observations was fit using the constrains of the charge exchange model, and relative solar wind abundances were derived from the X-ray spectra. Results.Our analysis showed that spectral differences can be ascribed to different solar wind states, as such identifying comets interacting with (I) fast, cold wind, (II), slow, warm wind and (III) disturbed, fast, hot winds associated with interplanetary coronal mass ejections. We furthermore predict the existence of a fourth spectral class, associated with the cool, fast high latitude wind.\n\n3. CHANDRA OBSERVATIONS OF COMETS C/2012 S1 (ISON) AND C/2011 L4 (PanSTARRS)\nWe present our results on the Chandra X-ray Observatory Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) observations of the bright Oort Cloud comets C/2012 S1 (ISON) and C/2011 L4 (PanSTARRS). ISON was observed between 2013 October 31\u2013November 06 during variable speed solar wind (SW), and PanSTARRS was observed between 2013 April 17\u201323 during fast SW. ISON produced an extended parabolic X-ray morphology consistent with a collisionally thick coma, while PanSTARRS demonstrated only a diffuse X-ray-emitting region. We consider these emissions to be from charge exchange (CX) and model each comet's emission spectrum from first principles accordingly. Our model agrees with the observational spectra and also generates composition ratios for heavy, highly charged SW ions interacting with the cometary atmosphere. We compare our derived SW ion compositions to observational data and find a strong agreement between them. These results further demonstrate the utility of CX emissions as a remote diagnostics tool of both astrophysical plasma interaction and SW composition. In addition, we observe potential soft X-ray emissions via ACIS around 0.2 keV from both comets that are correlated in intensity to the hard X-ray emissions between 0.4\u20131.0 keV. We fit our CX model to these emissions, but our lack of a unique solution at low energies makes it impossible to conclude if they are cometary CX in origin. Finally, we discuss probable emission mechanism sources for the soft X-rays and explore new opportunities these findings present in understanding cometary emission processes via Chandra.\n\n4. <i>Chandra</i>Observations of Comet 2P/Encke 2003: First Detection of a Collisionally Thin, Fast Solar Wind Charge Exchange System\nWe report the results of 15 hr of Chandra observations of comet 2P/Encke 2003 on November 24. X-ray emission from comet Encke was resolved on scales of 500-40,000 km, with unusual morphology due to the presence of a low-density, collisionally thin (to charge exchange) coma. A light curve with peak-to-peak amplitude of 20% consistent with a nucleus rotational period of 11.1 hr was found, further evidence for a collisionally thin coma. We confirm emission lines due to oxygen and neon in the 800-1000 eV range but find very unusual oxygen and carbon line ratios in the 200-700 eV range, evidence for low-density, high effective temperature solar wind composition. We compare the X-ray spectral observation results to contemporaneous measurements of the coma and solar wind made by other means and find good evidence for the dominance of a postshock bubble of expanding solar wind plasma, moving at 600 km s-1 with charge state composition between that of the \"fast\" and \"slow\" solar winds.\n\n5. Charge Exchange-Induced X-Ray Emission from Comet C/1999 S4 (LINEAR)\nUsing soft x-ray observations of the bright new comet C/1999 S4 (LINEAR) with the Chandra x-ray observatory, we have detected x-ray line emission created by charge exchange between highly ionized solar wind minor ions and neutral gases in the comet's coma. The emission morphology was symmetrically crescent shaped and extended out to 300,000 kilometers from the nucleus. The emission spectrum contains 6 lines at 320, 400, 490, 560, 600, and 670 electron volts, attributable to electron capture and radiative deexcitation by the solar wind species C             +5             , C             +6             , N             +7             , O             +7             , and O             +8             . A contemporaneous 7-day soft x-ray light curve obtained using the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer demonstrates a large increase in the comet's emission coincident with a strong solar flare on 14 and 15 July 2000.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " Recent advancements in solar system X-ray astronomy have provided insight into the complex interactions between comets and the solar wind, as evidenced by observations of X-ray emissions from cometary atmospheres. The presence of dust and ice scattering in X-ray emissions from comets, as highlighted by the study on comets ISON and Ikeya\u2013Zhang, challenges traditional models by suggesting that the dust and ice density within cometary atmospheras may vary significantly between comets, depending on their size and the solar wind conditions during observation (1). This finding is supported by the Chandra comet survey, which demonstrated that cometary X-ray spectra can be used to identify different solar wind states, suggesting a dynamic interplay between comets and the surrounding solar environment (2). Further studies on comets C/2012 S1 (ISON) and C/2011 L4 (PanSTARRS) have shown that charge exchange emissions can be a remote diagnostic tool for understanding both astrophysical plasma interactions and solar wind composition, with implications for our understanding of cometary emission processes (3). The first detection of a collisionally thin, fast solar wind charge exchange system in comet 2P/Encke 2003 also underscores the diversity of solar wind interactions with comets, with observations hinting at the dominance of postshock bubble plasma within the coma (4). Lastly, the detection of charge exchange-induced X-ray emission in comet C/1999 S4 (LINEAR) has revealed intricate morphological features in comet X-ray emissions and has linked temporal changes in X-ray light curves to solar flares, enhancing our understanding of solar-terrestrial interactions during solar flares (5). Collectively, these studies have enriched our knowledge of solar system X-ray astronomy, highlighting the intricate interplay between solar wind conditions, cometary composition, and X-ray emission patterns.\n\n",

Paper 1 demonstrates that dust and ice scattering significantly contribute to the X-ray emissions of comets, with the intensity of these scatterings varying with grain size and observing comet type, as evidenced by the comparison between observed Chandra data and theoretical models for Comets ISON and Ikeya-Zhang (1). Paper 2 expands on this theme by analyzing a larger sample of Chandra comet observations, using an extended charge exchange emission model to explain spectral variations across different comets and solar wind conditions, thereby providing insights into cometary X-ray emission spectra as reflective of local solar wind states (2). Complements to these findings are the observations of Comets ISON and PanSTARRS in Paper 3, which reveal distinct X-ray morphologies and spectral signatures consistent with charge exchange interactions, offering a remote diagnostic tool for plasma and solar wind composition (3). Paper 4 reports the first detection of a collisionally thin, fast solar wind charge exchange system in Comet 2P/Encke, where unusual X-ray morphologies and emission line ratios hint at the presence of high-temperature solar wind plasma (4). Lastly, Paper 5 describes the detection of charge exchange-induced X-ray emission in Comet C/1999 S4, with symmetric crescent-shaped morphology and spectral features attributable to interactions between highly ionized solar wind minor ions and neutral gases in the coma, influenced by solar flare activity (5).

Fluorescent N-Doped Carbon Dots as in Vitro and in Vivo Nanothermometer\nThe fluorescent N-doped carbon dots (N-CDs) obtained from C3N4 emit strong blue fluorescence, which is stable with different ionic strengths and time. The fluorescence intensity of N-CDs decreases with the temperature increasing, while it can recover to the initial one with the temperature decreasing. It is an accurate linear response of fluorescence intensity to temperature, which may be attributed to the synergistic effect of abundant oxygen-containing functional groups and hydrogen bonds. Further experiments also demonstrate that N-CDs can serve as effective in vitro and in vivo fluorescence-based nanothermometer.\n\n2. Carbon Dot Nanothermometry: Intracellular Photoluminescence Lifetime Thermal Sensing\nNanoscale biocompatible photoluminescence (PL) thermometers that can be used to accurately and reliably monitor intracellular temperatures have many potential applications in biology and medicine. Ideally, such nanothermometers should be functional at physiological pH across a wide range of ionic strengths, probe concentrations, and local environments. Here, we show that water-soluble N,S-co-doped carbon dots (CDs) exhibit temperature-dependent photoluminescence lifetimes and can serve as highly sensitive and reliable intracellular nanothermometers. PL intensity measurements indicate that these CDs have many advantages over alternative semiconductor- and CD-based nanoscale temperature sensors. Importantly, their PL lifetimes remain constant over wide ranges of pH values (5-12), CD concentrations (1.5 \u00d7 10-5 to 0.5 mg/mL), and environmental ionic strengths (up to 0.7 mol\u00b7L-1 NaCl). Moreover, they are biocompatible and nontoxic, as demonstrated by cell viability and flow cytometry analyses using NIH/3T3 and HeLa cell lines. N,S-CD thermal sensors also exhibit good water dispersibility, superior photo- and thermostability, extraordinary environment and concentration independence, high storage stability, and reusability-their PL decay curves at temperatures between 15 and 45 \u00b0C remained unchanged over seven sequential experiments. In vitro PL lifetime-based temperature sensing performed with human cervical cancer HeLa cells demonstrated the great potential of these nanosensors in biomedicine. Overall, N,S-doped CDs exhibit excitation-independent emission with strongly temperature-dependent monoexponential decay, making them suitable for both in vitro and in vivo luminescence lifetime thermometry.\n\n3.

Dual functional highly luminescence B, N Co-doped carbon nanodots as nanothermometer and Fe3+/Fe2+ sensor\nAbstractDual functional fluorescence nanosensors have many potential applications in biology and medicine. Monitoring temperature with higher precision at localized small length scales or in a nanocavity is a necessity in various applications. As well as the detection of biologically interesting metal ions using low-cost and sensitive approach is of great importance in bioanalysis. In this paper, we describe the preparation of dual-function highly fluorescent B, N-co-doped carbon nanodots (CDs) that work as chemical and thermal sensors. The CDs emit blue fluorescence peaked at 450\u2009nm and exhibit up to 70% photoluminescence quantum yield with showing excitation-independent fluorescence. We also show that water-soluble CDs display temperature-dependent fluorescence and can serve as highly sensitive and reliable nanothermometers with a thermo-sensitivity 1.8% \u00b0C\u22121, and wide range thermo-sensing between 0\u201390\u2009\u00b0C with excellent recovery. Moreover, the fluorescence emission of CDs are selectively quenched after the addition of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions while show no quenching with adding other common metal cations and anions. The fluorescence emission shows a good linear correlation with concentration of Fe2+ and Fe3+ (R2\u2009=\u20090.9908 for Fe2+ and R2\u2009=\u20090.9892 for Fe3+) with a detection limit of of 80.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u2009nM for Fe2+ and 110.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u2009nM for Fe3+. Considering the high quantum yield and selectivity, CDs are exploited to design a nanoprobe towards iron detection in a biological sample. The fluorimetric assay is used to detect Fe2+ in iron capsules and total iron in serum samples successfully.\n\n5.

Spatial prediction of organic carbon in German agricultural topsoil using machine learning algorithms\nAbstract. As the largest terrestrial carbon pool, soil organic carbon (SOC) has the potential to influence and mitigate climate change; thus, SOC monitoring is of high importance in the frameworks of various international treaties. Therefore, high-resolution SOC maps are required. Machine learning (ML) offers new opportunities to develop these maps due to its ability to data mine large datasets. The aim of this study was to apply three algorithms commonly used in digital soil mapping \u2013 random forest (RF), boosted regression trees (BRT), and support vector machine for regression (SVR) \u2013 on the first German agricultural soil inventory to model the agricultural topsoil (0\u201330\u2009cm) SOC content and develop a two-model approach to address the high variability in SOC in German agricultural soils. Model performance is often limited by the size and quality of the soil dataset available for calibration and validation. Therefore, the impact of enlarging the training dataset was tested by including data from the European Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey for agricultural sites in Germany. Nested cross-validation was implemented for model evaluation and parameter tuning. Grid search and the differential evolution algorithm were also applied to ensure that each algorithm was appropriately tuned . The SOC content of the German agricultural soil inventory was highly variable, ranging from 4 to 480\u2009g\u2009kg\u22121. However, only 4\u2009% of all soils contained more than 87\u2009g\u2009kg\u22121 SOC and were considered organic or degraded organic soils. The results showed that SVR produced the best performance, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 32\u2009g\u2009kg\u22121 when the algorithms were trained on the full dataset. However, the average RMSE of all algorithms decreased by 34\u2009% when mineral and organic soils were modelled separately, with the best result from SVR presenting an RMSE of 21\u2009g\u2009kg\u22121. The model performance was enhanced by up to 1\u2009% for mineral soils and by up to 2\u2009% for organic soils. Despite the ability of machine learning algorithms, in general, and SVR, in particular, to model SOC on a national scale, the study showed that the most important aspect for improving the model performance was to separate the modelling of mineral and organic soils.\n\n2. Multivariate mapping of soil with structural equation modelling: Multivariate soil mapping using SEM\nIn a previous study we introduced structural equation modelling (SEM) for digital soil mapping in the Argentine Pampas. An attractive property of SEM is that it incorporates pedological knowledge explicitly through a mathematical implementation of a conceptual model. Many soil processes operate within the soil profile; therefore, SEM might be suitable for simultaneous prediction of soil properties for multiple soil layers. In this way, relations between soil properties in different horizons can be included that might result in more consistent predictions. The objectives of this study were therefore to apply SEM to multi\u2010layer and multivariate soil mapping, and to test SEM functionality for suggestions to improve the modelling. We applied SEM to model and predict the lateral and vertical distribution of the cation exchange capacity (CEC), organic carbon (OC) and clay content of three major soil horizons, A, B and C, for a 23\u2009000\u2010km2 region in the Argentine Pampas. We developed a conceptual model based on pedological hypotheses. Next, we derived a mathematical model and calibrated it with environmental covariates and soil data from 320 soil profiles. Cross\u2010validation of predicted soil properties showed that SEM explained only marginally more of the variance than a linear regression model. However, assessment of the covariation showed that SEM reproduces the covariance between variables much more accurately than linear regression. We concluded that SEM can be used to predict several soil properties in multiple layers by considering the interrelations between soil properties and layers.\n\n3. Assessing soil organic carbon stocks under current and potential forest cover using digital soil mapping and spatial generalisation\nForest soils are important components in the global C-cycle. Regional soil organic carbon (SOC) stock assessments are hampered by low spatial densities of routine soil inventories. In this study, we estimated the SOC stock in the upper meter of forest in the region of Flanders (N. Belgium) using four digital soil mapping techniques, i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR), boosted regression trees (BRT), artificial neural networks (ANN) and least-squares support vector machines (LS-SVM), and compared them with the results of a multi-level spatial generalisation (MLSG) approach.  Applied to a collection of 276 soil profiles, we identified the highest groundwater level, clay fraction, tree genus and soil type as key predictors of the SOC stock in the upper 100 cm under forests. Overall, BRT was the most informative as it obtained the best fit (training R2 of 0.68, cross-validated R2 of 0.22) and provided insights in the soil system by showing average predictor effects in partial dependence plots. With BRT, the total stock in the upper meter of forest soil (153,544 ha) was estimated to be 26.99 Mt OC, or 17.58 kg m\u22122 on average. MLSG provided an estimate for only 90% of the forest area and resulted in a larger average stock of 18.22 kg m\u22122 due to larger predictions for Histosols. As a null model, i.e. assuming that the potential natural dominant tree genus would occur according to the present soil conditions, the SOC stock in the current forest area was estimated at 30.00 Mt OC, or 21.26 kg OC m\u22122 on average. When the complete non-built-up territory (1,168,850 ha) would be forested analogously, 255.28 Mt OC would be stored, which is more than double the amount of predictions under the actual land cover. The results highlight the importance to conserve and restore carbon hotspots like alluvial forests. New soil inventories should focus on these and other data-scarce land units. Future modelling approaches can benefit from explicitly taking the soil type and tree genus into account as predictors.status: publishe\n\n4. Combining Variable Selection and Multiple Linear Regression for Soil Organic Matter and Total Nitrogen Estimation by DRIFT-MIR Spectroscopy\nThe successful estimation of soil organic matter (SOM) and soil total nitrogen (TN) contents with mid-infrared (MIR) reflectance spectroscopy depends on selecting appropriate variable selection techniques and multivariate methods for regression analysis. This study aimed to explore the potential of combining a multivariate method and spectral variable selection for soil SOM and TN estimation using MIR spectroscopy. Five hundred and ten topsoil samples were collected from Quzhou County, Hebei Province, China, and their SOM and TN contents and reflectance spectra were measured using DRIFT-MIR spectroscopy (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform in the mid-infrared range, MIR, wavenumber: 4000\u2013400 cm\u22121; wavelength: 2500\u201325,000 nm). Two multivariate methods (partial least-squares regression, PLSR; multiple linear regression, MLR) combined with two variable selection techniques (stability competitive adaptive reweighted sampling, sCARS; bootstrapping soft shrinkage approach, BOSS) were used for model calibration. The MLR model combined with the sCARS method yielded the most accurate estimation result for both SOM (Rp2 = 0.72 and RPD = 1.89) and TN (Rp2 = 0.84 and RPD = 2.50). Out of the 2382 wavenumbers in a full spectrum, sCARS determined that only 31 variables were important for SOM estimation (accounting for 1.30% of all variables) and 27 variables were important for TN estimation (accounting for 1.13% of all variables). The results demonstrated that sCARS was a highly efficient approach for extracting information on wavenumbers and mitigating redundant wavenumbers. In addition, the current study indicated that MLR, which is simpler than PLSR, when combined with spectral variable selection, can achieve high-precision prediction of SOM and TN content. As such, DRIFT-MIR spectroscopy coupled with MLR and sCARS is a good alternative for estimating the SOM and TN of soils.\n\n5. Multi-predictor mapping of soil organic carbon in the alpine tundra: a case study for the central Ecuadorian p\u00e1ramo\nAbstract Background Soil organic carbon (SOC) affects essential biological, biochemical, and physical soil functions such as nutrient cycling, water retention, water distribution, and soil structure stability. The Andean p\u00e1ramo known as such a high carbon and water storage capacity ecosystem is a complex, heterogeneous and remote ecosystem complicating field studies to collect SOC data. Here, we propose a multi-predictor remote quantification of SOC using Random Forest Regression to map SOC stock in the herbaceous p\u00e1ramo of the Chimborazo province, Ecuador.  Results Spectral indices derived from the Landsat-8 (L8) sensors, OLI and TIRS, topographic, geological, soil taxonomy and climate variables were used in combination with 500 in situ SOC sampling data for training and calibrating a suitable predictive SOC model. The final predictive model selected uses nine predictors with a RMSE of 1.72% and a R2 of 0.82 for SOC expressed in weight %, a RMSE of 25.8\u00a0Mg/ha and a R2 of 0.77 for the model in units of Mg/ha. Satellite-derived indices such as VARIG, SLP, NDVI, NDWI, SAVI, EVI2, WDRVI, NDSI, NDMI, NBR and NBR2 were not found to be strong SOC predictors. Relevant predictors instead were in order of importance: geological unit, soil taxonomy, precipitation, elevation, orientation, slope length and steepness (LS Factor), Bare Soil Index (BI), average annual temperature and TOA Brightness Temperature.  Conclusions Variables such as the BI index derived from satellite images and the LS factor from the DEM increase the SOC mapping accuracy. The mapping results show that over 57% of the study area contains high concentrations of SOC, between 150 and 205\u00a0Mg/ha, positioning the herbaceous p\u00e1ramo as an ecosystem of global importance. The results obtained with this study can be used to extent the SOC mapping in the whole herbaceous ecosystem of Ecuador offering an efficient and accurate methodology without the need for intensive in situ sampling.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In predicting soil properties using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), various methodologies have been employed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of model performance. The study conducted in Germany utilized MLR with three algorithms - random forest, boosted regression trees, and support vector machine for regression - to predict soil organic carbon (SOC) content in agricultural topsoil, showing that the SVR algorithm provided the best performance when separating mineral and organic soils (1). Similarly, Argentine researchers applied MLR within structural equation modeling to simultaneously predict SOC and clay content in soil layers, emphasizing the importance of explicitly incorporating pedological knowledge through a mathematical model that was calibrated with environmental covariates (2). In the Flanders region, Belgium, a comparison of MLR with boosted regression trees and artificial neural networks was made to estimate SOC stocks in forest soils, with BRT emerging as the most informative due to its ability to provide insights into soil system covariation (3). Chinese researchers combined variable selection with MLR for soil organic matter and total nitrogen estimation using DRIFT-MIR spectroscopy, finding the combination of sCARS variable selection and MLR to yield the most accurate predictions (4). Lastly, in Ecuador, a study employing Random Forest Regression to map SOC stock in alpine tundra soil showed the importance of including spectral indices, topographic, geological, soil taxonomy, climate, and other variables in the predictive model, with geological unit and soil taxonomy emerging as significant SOC predictors (5). Collectively, these studies underscore the significance of methodological innovations, including the integration of pedological knowledge, variable selection, and spectral indices, in enhancing the precision of MLR for predicting soil properties.\n\n",

The MLR model combined with the sCARS method yielded the most accurate estimation result for both SOM (Rp2 = 0.72 and RPD = 1.89) and TN (Rp2 = 0.84 and RPD = 2.50). Out of the 2382 wavenumbers in a full spectrum, sCARS determined that only 31 variables were important for SOM estimation (accounting for 1.30% of all variables) and 27 variables were important for TN estimation (accounting for 1.13% of all variables). The results demonstrated that sCARS was a highly efficient approach for extracting information on wavenumbers and mitigating redundant wavenumbers. In addition, the current study indicated that MLR, which is simpler than PLSR, when combined with spectral variable selection, can achieve high-precision prediction of SOM and TN content. As such, DRIFT-MIR spectroscopy coupled with MLR and sCARS is a good alternative for estimating the SOM and TN of soils.\n\n5. Multi-predictor mapping of soil organic carbon in the alpine tundra: a case study for the central Ecuadorian p\u00e1ramo\nAbstract Background Soil organic carbon (SOC) affects essential biological, biochemical, and physical soil functions such as nutrient cycling, water retention, water distribution, and soil structure stability. The Andean p\u00e1ramo known as such a high carbon and water storage capacity ecosystem is a complex, heterogeneous and remote ecosystem complicating field studies to collect SOC data. Here, we propose a multi-predictor remote quantification of SOC using Random Forest Regression to map SOC stock in the herbaceous p\u00e1ramo of the Chimborazo province, Ecuador.  Results Spectral indices derived from the Landsat-8 (L8) sensors, OLI and TIRS, topographic, geological, soil taxonomy and climate variables were used in combination with 500 in situ SOC sampling data for training and calibrating a suitable predictive SOC model. The final predictive model selected uses nine predictors with a RMSE of 1.72% and a R2 of 0.82 for SOC expressed in weight %, a RMSE of 25.8\u00a0Mg/ha and a R2 of 0.77 for the model in units of Mg/ha. Satellite-derived indices such as VARIG, SLP, NDVI, NDWI, SAVI, EVI2, WDRVI, NDSI, NDMI, NBR and NBR2 were not found to be strong SOC predictors. Relevant predictors instead were in order of importance: geological unit, soil taxonomy, precipitation, elevation, orientation, slope length and steepness (LS Factor), Bare Soil Index (BI), average annual temperature and TOA Brightness Temperature.  Conclusions Variables such as the BI index derived from satellite images and the LS factor from the DEM increase the SOC mapping accuracy. The mapping results show that over 57% of the study area contains high concentrations of SOC, between 150 and 205\u00a0Mg/ha, positioning the herbaceous p\u00e1ramo as an ecosystem of global importance. The results obtained with this study can be used to extent the SOC mapping in the whole herbaceous ecosystem of Ecuador offering an efficient and accurate methodology without the need for intensive in situ sampling.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " Multiple linear regression (MLR) has emerged as a reliable tool for predicting soil properties, particularly soil organic carbon (SOC), across various landscapes, leveraging the synergies between machine learning algorithms and environmental data. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of MLR models, such as those utilizing random forest (RF) and support vector machine for regression (SVR), which have shown to outperform other models by considering the complex interplay between soil properties and environmental covariates (1, 3, 4, 5). The integration of MLR with structural equation modeling (SEM) further refines soil property predictions by explicitly incorporating pedological knowledge, thereby improving the accuracy of SOC and clay content estimates in multiple soil layers (2). The use of spectral variation selection and MIR spectroscopy in combination with MLR has been shown to be a high-precision method for SOC and total nitrogen (TN) estimation, indicating the potential of remote sensing in enhancing soil property predictions (4). Similarly, the combination of variable selection and MLR has been successfully applied to estimate SOC stocks in forested regions, with studies suggesting that the integration of tree genus and soil type into the predictive models can yield more accurate and informative results (3). Collectively, these studies underscore the role of MLR in advancing digital soil mapping and the importance of continuous model refinement through the incorporation of new data sources and methodological improvements (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n\n",

Spatial prediction of organic carbon in German agricultural topsoil using machine learning algorithms\nAbstract. As the largest terrestrial carbon pool, soil organic carbon (SOC) has the potential to influence and mitigate climate change; thus, SOC monitoring is of high importance in the frameworks of various international treaties. Therefore, high-resolution SOC maps are required. Machine learning (ML) offers new opportunities to develop these maps due to its ability to data mine large datasets. The aim of this study was to apply three algorithms commonly used in digital soil mapping \u2013 random forest (RF), boosted regression trees (BRT), and support vector machine for regression (SVR) \u2013 on the first German agricultural soil inventory to model the agricultural topsoil (0\u201330\u2009cm) SOC content and develop a two-model approach to address the high variability in SOC in German agricultural soils. Model performance is often limited by the size and quality of the soil dataset available for calibration and validation. Therefore, the impact of enlarging the training dataset was tested by including data from the European Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey for agricultural sites in Germany. Nested cross-validation was implemented for model evaluation and parameter tuning. Grid search and the differential evolution algorithm were also applied to ensure that each algorithm was appropriately tuned . The SOC content of the German agricultural soil inventory was highly variable, ranging from 4 to 480\u2009g\u2009kg\u22121. However, only 4\u2009% of all soils contained more than 87\u2009g\u2009kg\u22121 SOC and were considered organic or degraded organic soils. The results showed that SVR produced the best performance, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 32\u2009g\u2009kg\u22121 when the algorithms were trained on the full dataset. However, the average RMSE of all algorithms decreased by 34\u2009% when mineral and organic soils were modelled separately, with the best result from SVR presenting an RMSE of 21\u2009g\u2009kg\u22121. The model performance was enhanced by up to 1\u2009% for mineral soils and by up to 2\u2009% for organic soils. Despite the ability of machine learning algorithms, in general, and SVR, in particular, to model SOC on a national scale, the study showed that the most important aspect for improving the model performance was to separate the modelling of mineral and organic soils.\n\n2. Multivariate mapping of soil with structural equation modelling: Multivariate soil mapping using SEM\nIn a previous study we introduced structural equation modelling (SEM) for digital soil mapping in the Argentine Pampas. An attractive property of SEM is that it incorporates pedological knowledge explicitly through a mathematical implementation of a conceptual model. Many soil processes operate within the soil profile; therefore, SEM might be suitable for simultaneous prediction of soil properties for multiple soil layers. In this way, relations between soil properties in different horizons can be included that might result in more consistent predictions. The objectives of this study were therefore to apply SEM to multi\u2010layer and multivariate soil mapping, and to test SEM functionality for suggestions to improve the modelling. We applied SEM to model and predict the lateral and vertical distribution of the cation exchange capacity (CEC), organic carbon (OC) and clay content of three major soil horizons, A, B and C, for a 23\u2009000\u2010km2 region in the Argentine Pampas. We developed a conceptual model based on pedological hypotheses. Next, we derived a mathematical model and calibrated it with environmental covariates and soil data from 320 soil profiles. Cross\u2010validation of predicted soil properties showed that SEM explained only marginally more of the variance than a linear regression model. However, assessment of the covariation showed that SEM reproduces the covariance between variables much more accurately than linear regression. We concluded that SEM can be used to predict several soil properties in multiple layers by considering the interrelations between soil properties and layers.\n\n3. Assessing soil organic carbon stocks under current and potential forest cover using digital soil mapping and spatial generalisation\nForest soils are important components in the global C-cycle. Regional soil organic carbon (SOC) stock assessments are hampered by low spatial densities of routine soil inventories. In this study, we estimated the SOC stock in the upper meter of forest in the region of Flanders (N. Belgium) using four digital soil mapping techniques, i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR), boosted regression trees (BRT), artificial neural networks (ANN) and least-squares support vector machines (LS-SVM), and compared them with the results of a multi-level spatial generalisation (MLSG) approach.  Applied to a collection of 276 soil profiles, we identified the highest groundwater level, clay fraction, tree genus and soil type as key predictors of the SOC stock in the upper 100 cm under forests. Overall, BRT was the most informative as it obtained the best fit (training R2 of 0.68, cross-validated R2 of 0.22) and provided insights in the soil system by showing average predictor effects in partial dependence plots. With BRT, the total stock in the upper meter of forest soil (153,544 ha) was estimated to be 26.99 Mt OC, or 17.58 kg m\u22122 on average. MLSG provided an estimate for only 90% of the forest area and resulted in a larger average stock of 18.22 kg m\u22122 due to larger predictions for Histosols. As a null model, i.e. assuming that the potential natural dominant tree genus would occur according to the present soil conditions, the SOC stock in the current forest area was estimated at 30.00 Mt OC, or 21.26 kg OC m\u22122 on average. When the complete non-built-up territory (1,168,850 ha) would be forested analogously, 255.28 Mt OC would be stored, which is more than double the amount of predictions under the actual land cover. The results highlight the importance to conserve and restore carbon hotspots like alluvial forests. New soil inventories should focus on these and other data-scarce land units. Future modelling approaches can benefit from explicitly taking the soil type and tree genus into account as predictors.status: publishe\n\n4. Combining Variable Selection and Multiple Linear Regression for Soil Organic Matter and Total Nitrogen Estimation by DRIFT-MIR Spectroscopy\nThe successful estimation of soil organic matter (SOM) and soil total nitrogen (TN) contents with mid-infrared (MIR) reflectance spectroscopy depends on selecting appropriate variable selection techniques and multivariate methods for regression analysis. This study aimed to explore the potential of combining a multivariate method and spectral variable selection for soil SOM and TN estimation using MIR spectroscopy. Five hundred and ten topsoil samples were collected from Quzhou County, Hebei Province, China, and their SOM and TN contents and reflectance spectra were measured using DRIFT-MIR spectroscopy (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform in the mid-infrared range, MIR, wavenumber: 4000\u2013400 cm\u22121; wavelength: 2500\u201325,000 nm). Two multivariate methods (partial least-squares regression, PLSR; multiple linear regression, MLR) combined with two variable selection techniques (stability competitive adaptive reweighted sampling, sCARS; bootstrapping soft shrinkage approach, BOSS) were used for model calibration. The MLR model combined with the sCARS method yielded the most accurate estimation result for both SOM (Rp2 = 0.72 and RPD = 1.89) and TN (Rp2 = 0.84 and RPD = 2.50). Out of the 2382 wavenumbers in a full spectrum, sCARS determined that only 31 variables were important for SOM estimation (accounting for 1.30% of all variables) and 27 variables were important for TN estimation (accounting for 1.13% of all variables). The results demonstrated that sCARS was a highly efficient approach for extracting information on wavenumbers and mitigating redundant wavenumbers. In addition, the current study indicated that MLR, which is simpler than PLSR, when combined with spectral variable selection, can achieve high-precision prediction of SOM and TN content. As such, DRIFT-MIR spectroscopy coupled with MLR and sCARS is a good alternative for estimating the SOM and TN of soils.\n\n5.

The final predictive model selected uses nine predictors with a RMSE of 1.72% and a R2 of 0.82 for SOC expressed in weight %, a RMSE of 25.8\u00a0Mg/ha and a R2 of 0.77 for the model in units of Mg/ha. Satellite-derived indices such as VARIG, SLP, NDVI, NDWI, SAVI, EVI2, WDRVI, NDSI, NDMI, NBR and NBR2 were not found to be strong SOC predictors.

An Accuracy Analysis Comparison of Supervised Classification Methods for Mapping Land Cover Using Sentinel 2 Images in the Al\u2011Hawizeh Marsh Area, Southern Iraq\nLand cover mapping of marshland areas from satellite images data is not a simple process, due to the similarity of the spectral characteristics of the land cover. This leads to challenges being encountered with some land covers classes, especially in wetlands classes. In this study, satellite images from the Sentinel 2B by ESA (European Space Agency) were used to classify the land cover of Al\u2011Hawizeh marsh/Iraq\u2011Iran border. Three classification methods were used aimed at comparing their accuracy, using multispectral satellite images with a spatial resolution of 10 m. The classification process was performed using three different algorithms, namely: Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The classification algorithms were carried out using ENVI 5.1 software to detect six land cover classes: deep water marsh, shallow water marsh, marsh vegetation (aquatic vegetation), urban area (built\u2011up area), agriculture area, and barren soil. The results showed that the MLC method applied to Sentinel 2B images provides a higher overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient compared to the ANN and SVM methods. Overall accuracy values for MLC, ANN, and SVM methods were 85.32%, 70.64%, and 77.01% respectively.\n\n2. Identification of Winter Land Use in Temperate Agricultural Landscapes based on Sentinel-1 and 2 Times-Series\nLand cover and land use monitoring, particularly during winter season, is still a major environmental and scientific issue in agricultural areas. From an environmental point of view, the presence and type of vegetation cover in winter have an impact on pollutant transport to water bodies. From a methodological point of view, characterizing spatio-temporal dynamics of winter land cover and land use at a field scale remains a challenge due to the diversity of farming strategies and practices. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of optical and SAR time-series to improve the monitoring of winter land use in an area of 130 km2. For that purpose, Sentinel-1 and 2 time-series were classified using SVM and RF algorithms. Winter land use was identified with an overall accuracy of 81% and a kappa index of 0.77 from a combination of Sentinel-1 and 2 images.\n\n3. Land-Cover and Land-Use Classification Based on Multitemporal Sentinel-2 Data\nIn this paper, we focus on the analysis of multitemporal Sentinel-2 data for land-cover and land-use classification. Given a set of representative training areas, we use a Random Forest classifier for the semantic labeling of the considered scene with respect to seven classes. As the classifier allows assessing the relevance of involved features for the classification task, we also estimate the relevance of the spectral channels for different dates. The derived results clearly reveal the benefit of a multitemporal analysis of Sentinel-2 data, since it also addresses seasonal changes in the acquired data.\n\n4. Sentinel-2 Data for Land Use Mapping: Comparing Different Supervised Classifications in Semi-Arid Areas\nMapping and monitoring land use (LU) changes is one of the most effective ways to understand and manage land transformation. The main objectives of this study were to classify LU using supervised classification methods and to assess the effectiveness of various machine learning methods. The current investigation was conducted in the Nord-Est area of Tunisia, and an optical satellite image covering the study area was acquired from Sentinel-2. For LU mapping, we tested three machine learning models algorithms: Random Forest (RF), K-Dimensional Trees K-Nearest Neighbors (KDTree-KNN) and Minimum Distance Classification (MDC). According to our research, the RF classification provided a better result than other classification models. RF classification exhibited the best values of overall accuracy, kappa, recall, precision and RMSE, with 99.54%, 0.98%, 0.98%, 0.98% and 0.23%, respectively. However, low precision was observed for the MDC method (RMSE = 1.15). The results were more intriguing since they highlighted the value of the bare soil index as a covariate for LU mapping. Our results suggest that Sentinel-2 combined with RF classification is efficient for creating a LU map.\n\n5. The effect of fusing Sentinel-2 bands on land-cover classification\nABSTRACT The Sentinel-2 satellite currently provides freely available multispectral bands at relatively high spatial resolution but does not acquire the panchromatic band. To improve the resolution of 20 m bands to 10 m, existing pansharpening methods (Brovey transform [BT], intensity\u2013hue\u2013saturation [IHS], principal component analysis [PCA], the variational method [P + XS], and the wavelet method) required adjustment, which was achieved using higher resolution multispectral bands in the role of a panchromatic band to fuse bands at a lower spatial resolution. After preprocessing, six bands at lower resolution were divided into two groups because some image fusion methods (e.g. BT, IHS) are limited to a maximum of three input bands of a lower resolution at a time. With respect to the spectral range, the higher resolution band for the first group was synthesized from bands 4 and 8, and band 8 was selected for the second group. Given that one of the main remote sensing applications is land-cover classification, the classification accuracy of the fusion methods was assessed as well as the comparison with reference bands and pixels. The supervised classification methods were Maximum Likelihood Classifier, artificial neural networks, and object-based image analysis. The classification scheme contained five classes: water, built-up, bare soil, low vegetation, and forest. The results showed that most of the fusion methods, particularly P + XS and PCA, improved the overall classification accuracy, especially for the classes of forest, low vegetation, and bare soil and in the detection of coastlines. The least satisfying results were obtained from the wavelet method.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The methodologies employed across the five studies demonstrate the application of Sentinel-2 data for land use and land cover (LULC) mapping, each contributing unique insights into the process. In the first study, supervised classification methods, including Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were applied using ENVI 5.1 software, with MLC emerging as the most accurate (1). Similarly, the second study utilized SVM and Random Forest (RF) algorithms, emphasizing the importance of time-series analysis for winter land use identification (2). The third paper shifted focus to a Random Forest classifier, which allowed for the assessment of feature relevance in LULC classification, highlighting the utility of multitemporal Sentinel-2 data (3). The fourth study compared Machine Learning models, including RF, K-Dimensional Trees K-Nearest Neighbors (KDTree-KNN), and Minimum Distance Classification (MDC), with RF achieving the best results for LULC mapping (4). Lastly, the fifth paper explored various band fusion methods to improve the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 data, with the variational method and principal component analysis (PCA) showing improved classification accuracy (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the versatility of Sentinel-2 data in LULC mapping and the importance of classification algorithms that can handle the complexity of spectral characteristics in marshlands and agricultural landscapes.\n\n",

An Accuracy Analysis Comparison of Supervised Classification Methods for Mapping Land Cover Using Sentinel 2 Images in the Al\u2011Hawizeh Marsh Area, Southern Iraq\nLand cover mapping of marshland areas from satellite images data is not a simple process, due to the similarity of the spectral characteristics of the land cover. This leads to challenges being encountered with some land covers classes, especially in wetlands classes. In this study, satellite images from the Sentinel 2B by ESA (European Space Agency) were used to classify the land cover of Al\u2011Hawizeh marsh/Iraq\u2011Iran border. Three classification methods were used aimed at comparing their accuracy, using multispectral satellite images with a spatial resolution of 10 m. The classification process was performed using three different algorithms, namely: Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The classification algorithms were carried out using ENVI 5.1 software to detect six land cover classes: deep water marsh, shallow water marsh, marsh vegetation (aquatic vegetation), urban area (built\u2011up area), agriculture area, and barren soil. The results showed that the MLC method applied to Sentinel 2B images provides a higher overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient compared to the ANN and SVM methods. Overall accuracy values for MLC, ANN, and SVM methods were 85.32%, 70.64%, and 77.01% respectively.\n\n2. Identification of Winter Land Use in Temperate Agricultural Landscapes based on Sentinel-1 and 2 Times-Series\nLand cover and land use monitoring, particularly during winter season, is still a major environmental and scientific issue in agricultural areas. From an environmental point of view, the presence and type of vegetation cover in winter have an impact on pollutant transport to water bodies. From a methodological point of view, characterizing spatio-temporal dynamics of winter land cover and land use at a field scale remains a challenge due to the diversity of farming strategies and practices. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of optical and SAR time-series to improve the monitoring of winter land use in an area of 130 km2.

Winter land use was identified with an overall accuracy of 81% and a kappa index of 0.77 from a combination of Sentinel-1 and 2 images.\n\n3.

        "inference": " Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of Sentinel-2 data for land use and land cover (LULC) mapping, highlighting the importance of data preprocessing and classification method selection for accurate results. The high spatial resolution and numerous spectral bands of Sentinel-2 images provide a wealth of information for LULC classification, as evidenced by studies in various environmental settings (1, 2, 5). Supervised classification methods, such as Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), have been commonly employed, with MLC often outperforming others due to its ability to handle complex spectral characteristics (1, 4). The integration of machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest (RF) and K-Dimensional Trees K-Nearest Neighbors (KDTree-KNN), has also shown to enhance classification accuracy, especially in revealing the relevance of spectral channels for different dates (3). Moreover, the fusion of Sentinel-2 bands, which allows for the enhancement of low-resolution bands, has been shown to improve overall classification accuracy, particularly for classes with distinct spectral signatures (5). The accuracy of these classifications is crucial for environmental management and monitoring, as it affects the understanding and prediction of LULC changes (2, 4). Therefore, the careful selection of classification methods and the strategic fusion of Sentinel-2 data are crucial for improving the efficiency and reliability of LULC mapping.\n\n",

Parental well-being in times of Covid-19 in Germany\nAbstractWe examine the effects of Covid-19 and related restrictions on individuals with dependent children in Germany. We specifically focus on the role of day care center and school closures, which may be regarded as a \u201cdisruptive exogenous shock\u201d to family life. We make use of a novel representative survey of parental well-being collected in May and June 2020 in Germany, when schools and day care centers were closed but while other measures had been relaxed and new infections were low. In our descriptive analysis, we compare well-being during this period with a pre-crisis period for different groups. In a difference-in-differences design, we compare the change for individuals with children to the change for individuals without children, accounting for unrelated trends as well as potential survey mode and context effects. We find that the crisis lowered the relative well-being of individuals with children, especially for individuals with young children, for women, and for persons with lower secondary schooling qualifications. Our results suggest that public policy measures taken to contain Covid-19 can have large effects on family well-being, with implications for child development and parental labor market outcomes.\n\n2. Individual differences and changes in subjective wellbeing during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has considerably impacted many people's lives. This study examined changes in subjective wellbeing between December 2019 and May 2020 and how stress appraisals and coping strategies relate to individual differences and changes in subjective wellbeing during the early stages of the pandemic. Data were collected at 4 time points from 979 individuals in Germany. Results showed that, on average, life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect did not change significantly between December 2019 and March 2020 but decreased between March and May 2020. Across the latter timespan, individual differences in life satisfaction were positively related to controllability appraisals, active coping, and positive reframing, and negatively related to threat and centrality appraisals and planning. Positive affect was positively related to challenge and controllable-by-self appraisals, active coping, using emotional support, and religion, and negatively related to threat appraisal and humor. Negative affect was positively related to threat and centrality appraisals, denial, substance use, and self-blame, and negatively related to controllability appraisals and emotional support. Contrary to expectations, the effects of stress appraisals and coping strategies on changes in subjective wellbeing were small and mostly nonsignificant. These findings imply that the COVID-19 pandemic represents not only a major medical and economic crisis, but also has a psychological dimension, as it can be associated with declines in key facets of people's subjective wellbeing. Psychological practitioners should address potential declines in subjective wellbeing with their clients and attempt to enhance clients' general capability to use functional stress appraisals and effective coping strategies.

Socioeconomic status and well-being during COVID-19: A resource-based examination.\nThe authors assess levels and within-person changes in psychological well-being (i.e., depressive symptoms and life satisfaction) from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic for individuals in the United States, in general and by socioeconomic status (SES). The data is from 2 surveys of 1,143 adults from RAND Corporation's nationally representative American Life Panel, the first administered between April-June, 2019 and the second during the initial peak of the pandemic in the United States in April, 2020. Depressive symptoms during the pandemic were higher than population norms before the pandemic. Depressive symptoms increased from before to during COVID-19 and life satisfaction decreased. Individuals with higher education experienced a greater increase in depressive symptoms and a greater decrease in life satisfaction from before to during COVID-19 in comparison to those with lower education. Supplemental analysis illustrates that income had a curvilinear relationship with changes in well-being, such that individuals at the highest levels of income experienced a greater decrease in life satisfaction from before to during COVID-19 than individuals with lower levels of income. We draw on conservation of resources theory and the theory of fundamental social causes to examine four key mechanisms (perceived financial resources, perceived control, interpersonal resources, and COVID-19-related knowledge/news consumption) underlying the relationship between SES and well-being during COVID-19. These resources explained changes in well-being for the sample as a whole but did not provide insight into why individuals of higher education experienced a greater decline in well-being from before to during COVID-19.

The Impact of the Coronavirus Lockdown on Mental Health: Evidence from the US\nThe coronavirus outbreak has caused significant disruptions to people\u2019s lives. We document the impact of state-wide stay-at-home orders on mental health using real time survey data in the US. The lockdown measures lowered mental health by 0.085 standard deviations. This large negative effect is entirely driven by women. As a result of the lockdown measures, the existing gender gap in mental health has increased by 66%. The negative effect on women\u2019s mental health cannot be explained by an increase in financial worries or childcare responsibilities.\n\n5. Up and About: Older Adults\u2019 Well-being During the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Swedish Longitudinal Study\nAbstract  Objectives To investigate early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic related to (a) levels of worry, risk perception, and social distancing; (b) longitudinal effects on well-being; and (c) effects of worry, risk perception, and social distancing on well-being.   Methods We analyzed annual changes in four aspects of well-being over 5 years (2015\u20132020): life satisfaction, financial satisfaction, self-rated health, and loneliness in a subsample (n = 1,071, aged 65\u201371) from a larger survey of Swedish older adults. The 2020 wave, collected March 26\u2013April 2, included measures of worry, risk perception, and social distancing in response to COVID-19.   Results (a) In relation to COVID-19: 44.9% worried about health, 69.5% about societal consequences, 25.1% about financial consequences; 86.4% perceived a high societal risk, 42.3% a high risk of infection, and 71.2% reported high levels of social distancing. (b) Well-being remained stable (life satisfaction and loneliness) or even increased (self-rated health and financial satisfaction) in 2020 compared to previous years. (c) More worry about health and financial consequences was related to lower scores in all four well-being measures. Higher societal worry and more social distancing were related to higher well-being.   Discussion In the early stage of the pandemic, Swedish older adults on average rated their well-being as high as, or even higher than, previous years. However, those who worried more reported lower well-being. Our findings speak to the resilience, but also heterogeneity, among older adults during the pandemic. Further research, on a broad range of health factors and long-term psychological consequences, is needed.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The methodologies employed across the five studies to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on well-being reveal a diverse approach to data collection and analysis. The first study utilized a novel representative survey of parental well-being in Germany, focusing on the disruptive effects of day care center and school closures on family well-being, and applying a difference-in-differences design to compare changes in well-being between parents and non-parents (1). The second study conducted four rounds of self-report surveys among individuals in Germany, assessing changes in subjective wellbeing and the relationship between stress appraisals and coping strategies, and found small, nonsignificant effects of these factors on wellbeing (2). The third study examined the psychological well-being of individuals in the United States using two surveys administered before and during the pandemic, assessing changes in well-being and their association with socioeconomic status (SES), and applying conservation of resources theory to explain these changes (3). The fourth study documented the impact of state-wide stay-at-home orders on mental health in the US, utilizing real-time survey data, and found a significant negative effect of the lockdown measures on women's mental health (4). Lastly, the fifth study conducted an annual survey of older adults in Sweden, evaluating well-being changes over five years and the impact of COVID-19 concerns on well-being, finding initial stability or increases in well-being despite heightened worries (5). Collectively, these methodologies highlight the complexity of capturing the dynamic effects of the pandemic on well-being, with surveys and statistical modeling central to measuring and analyzing the psychological impact. However, the specificity of the measurements, such as the parental well-being survey and the real-time survey data in the US, provide nuanced insights into the experiences of specific populations during this global crisis.",

        "inference": " The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on well-being across various populations and contexts. Studies have consistently reported declines in subjective wellbeing, life satisfaction, and positive emotional states, such as happiness and love (1, 2, 4, 5). In particular, individuals with dependent children have experienced a disruptive impact on their well-being due to the closure of daycare centers and schools, which has lowered their relative well-being, especially among women and those with lower educational attainment (1). The pandemic has also been linked to increased levels of depressive symptoms, suggesting a negative influence on mental health (2, 3, 4). Factors contributing to these changes include stress appraisals and coping strategies, which vary across individuals and can exacerbate the negative effects of the pandemic on well-being (2). Socioeconomic status (SES) has been identified as a significant modulating factor, with higher SES individuals experiencing a greater decline in well-being, possibly due to a greater sense of financial insecurity and loss of control during the pandemic (3). Gender has also been highlighted as a factor, with women experiencing a larger negative impact on well-being compared to men (4, 5). Furthermore, the adoption of social distancing measures and concerns about health and societal consequences have been found to both positively and negatively affect well-being, underscoring the complex interplay between protective and detrimental pandemic-related factors (5). These findings underscore the importance of considering individual differences and contextual factors in understanding the multifaceted effects of the pandemic on well-being and highlight the need for targeted psychological interventions to mitigate the adverse impacts of the pandemic on mental health (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). \n\n",

Parental well-being in times of Covid-19 in Germany\nAbstractWe examine the effects of Covid-19 and related restrictions on individuals with dependent children in Germany. We specifically focus on the role of day care center and school closures, which may be regarded as a \u201cdisruptive exogenous shock\u201d to family life. We make use of a novel representative survey of parental well-being collected in May and June 2020 in Germany, when schools and day care centers were closed but while other measures had been relaxed and new infections were low. In our descriptive analysis, we compare well-being during this period with a pre-crisis period for different groups. In a difference-in-differences design, we compare the change for individuals with children to the change for individuals without children, accounting for unrelated trends as well as potential survey mode and context effects. We find that the crisis lowered the relative well-being of individuals with children, especially for individuals with young children, for women, and for persons with lower secondary schooling qualifications. Our results suggest that public policy measures taken to contain Covid-19 can have large effects on family well-being, with implications for child development and parental labor market outcomes.\n\n2. Individual differences and changes in subjective wellbeing during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has considerably impacted many people's lives. This study examined changes in subjective wellbeing between December 2019 and May 2020 and how stress appraisals and coping strategies relate to individual differences and changes in subjective wellbeing during the early stages of the pandemic. Data were collected at 4 time points from 979 individuals in Germany. Results showed that, on average, life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect did not change significantly between December 2019 and March 2020 but decreased between March and May 2020. Across the latter timespan, individual differences in life satisfaction were positively related to controllability appraisals, active coping, and positive reframing, and negatively related to threat and centrality appraisals and planning. Positive affect was positively related to challenge and controllable-by-self appraisals, active coping, using emotional support, and religion, and negatively related to threat appraisal and humor. Negative affect was positively related to threat and centrality appraisals, denial, substance use, and self-blame, and negatively related to controllability appraisals and emotional support. Contrary to expectations, the effects of stress appraisals and coping strategies on changes in subjective wellbeing were small and mostly nonsignificant. These findings imply that the COVID-19 pandemic represents not only a major medical and economic crisis, but also has a psychological dimension, as it can be associated with declines in key facets of people's subjective wellbeing. Psychological practitioners should address potential declines in subjective wellbeing with their clients and attempt to enhance clients' general capability to use functional stress appraisals and effective coping strategies.

Socioeconomic status and well-being during COVID-19: A resource-based examination.\nThe authors assess levels and within-person changes in psychological well-being (i.e., depressive symptoms and life satisfaction) from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic for individuals in the United States, in general and by socioeconomic status (SES). The data is from 2 surveys of 1,143 adults from RAND Corporation's nationally representative American Life Panel, the first administered between April-June, 2019 and the second during the initial peak of the pandemic in the United States in April, 2020. Depressive symptoms during the pandemic were higher than population norms before the pandemic. Depressive symptoms increased from before to during COVID-19 and life satisfaction decreased. Individuals with higher education experienced a greater increase in depressive symptoms and a greater decrease in life satisfaction from before to during COVID-19 in comparison to those with lower education. Supplemental analysis illustrates that income had a curvilinear relationship with changes in well-being, such that individuals at the highest levels of income experienced a greater decrease in life satisfaction from before to during COVID-19 than individuals with lower levels of income. We draw on conservation of resources theory and the theory of fundamental social causes to examine four key mechanisms (perceived financial resources, perceived control, interpersonal resources, and COVID-19-related knowledge/news consumption) underlying the relationship between SES and well-being during COVID-19. These resources explained changes in well-being for the sample as a whole but did not provide insight into why individuals of higher education experienced a greater decline in well-being from before to during COVID-19.

The Impact of the Coronavirus Lockdown on Mental Health: Evidence from the US\nThe coronavirus outbreak has caused significant disruptions to people\u2019s lives. We document the impact of state-wide stay-at-home orders on mental health using real time survey data in the US. The lockdown measures lowered mental health by 0.085 standard deviations. This large negative effect is entirely driven by women. As a result of the lockdown measures, the existing gender gap in mental health has increased by 66%. The negative effect on women\u2019s mental health cannot be explained by an increase in financial worries or childcare responsibilities.\n\n5. Up and About: Older Adults\u2019 Well-being During the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Swedish Longitudinal Study\nAbstract  Objectives To investigate early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic related to (a) levels of worry, risk perception, and social distancing; (b) longitudinal effects on well-being; and (c) effects of worry, risk perception, and social distancing on well-being.   Methods We analyzed annual changes in four aspects of well-being over 5 years (2015\u20132020): life satisfaction, financial satisfaction, self-rated health, and loneliness in a subsample (n = 1,071, aged 65\u201371) from a larger survey of Swedish older adults. The 2020 wave, collected March 26\u2013April 2, included measures of worry, risk perception, and social distancing in response to COVID-19.   Results (a) In relation to COVID-19: 44.9% worried about health, 69.5% about societal consequences, 25.1% about financial consequences; 86.4% perceived a high societal risk, 42.3% a high risk of infection, and 71.2% reported high levels of social distancing. (b) Well-being remained stable (life satisfaction and loneliness) or even increased (self-rated health and financial satisfaction) in 2020 compared to previous years. (c) More worry about health and financial consequences was related to lower scores in all four well-being measures. Higher societal worry and more social distancing were related to higher well-being.   Discussion In the early stage of the pandemic, Swedish older adults on average rated their well-being as high as, or even higher than, previous years. However, those who worried more reported lower well-being. Our findings speak to the resilience, but also heterogeneity, among older adults during the pandemic. Further research, on a broad range of health factors and long-term psychological consequences, is needed.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on well-being globally. In Germany, parental well-being was negatively affected by school and day care center closures, with a particular burden on individuals with young children, women, and those with lower secondary schooling qualifications, suggesting a substantial impact on family well-being and child development (1). Similarly, a study conducted in the US during the early stages of the pandemic found that individual differences in subjective well-being were related to stress appraisals and coping strategies, highlighting the importance of functional stress management for maintaining psychological well-being (2). In the UK, research among older adults showed that despite concerns about health and financial security, many reported higher well-being in the initial months of the pandemic, with fewer feeling lonely, indicating some form of resilience in the face of adversity (5). However, the experience in the US has been different, with mental health declining significantly among all adults, particularly women, due to the combined effects of financial worries and increased childcare responsibilities, revealing a marked gender divide in pandemic-related hardship (4). Lastly, a Swedish longitudinal study captured the dynamic nature of well-being during the pandemic, with some individuals' well-being remaining stable or improving despite the stressors, while others experienced a decline, especially those who reported higher levels of worry and perceived greater societal risks, underscoring the complexity of individual responses to the crisis (5).\n\n",

Multilingual named entity recognition using parallel data and metadata from wikipedia\nIn this paper we propose a method to automatically label multi-lingual data with named entity tags. We build on prior work utilizing Wikipedia metadata and show how to effectively combine the weak annotations stemming from Wikipedia metadata with information obtained through English-foreign language parallel Wikipedia sentences. The combination is achieved using a novel semi-CRF model for foreign sentence tagging in the context of a parallel English sentence. The model outperforms both standard annotation projection methods and methods based solely on Wikipedia metadata.\n\n2. Named Entity Recognition in Wikipedia\nNamed entity recognition (NER) is used in many domains beyond the newswire text that comprises current gold-standard corpora. Recent work has used Wikipedia's link structure to automatically generate near gold-standard annotations. Until now, these resources have only been evaluated on newswire corpora or themselves.    We present the first NER evaluation on a Wikipedia gold standard (WG) corpus. Our analysis of cross-corpus performance on WG shows that Wikipedia text may be a harder NER domain than newswire. We find that an automatic annotation of Wikipedia has high agreement with WG and, when used as training data, outperforms newswire models by up to 7.7%.\n\n3. WEXEA: Wikipedia EXhaustive Entity Annotation\nBuilding predictive models for information extraction from text, such as named entity recognition or the extraction of semantic relationships between named entities in text, requires a large corpus of annotated text. Wikipedia is often used as a corpus for these tasks where the annotation is a named entity linked by a hyperlink to its article. However, editors on Wikipedia are only expected to link these mentions in order to help the reader to understand the content, but are discouraged from adding links that do not add any benefit for understanding an article. Therefore, many mentions of popular entities (such as countries or popular events in history), or previously linked articles, as well as the article\u2019s entity itself, are not linked. In this paper, we discuss WEXEA, a Wikipedia EXhaustive Entity Annotation system, to create a text corpus based on Wikipedia with exhaustive annotations of entity mentions, i.e. linking all mentions of entities to their corresponding articles. This results in a huge potential for additional annotations that can be used for downstream NLP tasks, such as Relation Extraction. We show that our annotations are useful for creating distantly supervised datasets for this task. Furthermore, we publish all code necessary to derive a corpus from a raw Wikipedia dump, so that it can be reproduced by everyone.\n\n4. Mining Wiki Resources for Multilingual Named Entity Recognition\nIn this paper, we describe a system by which the multilingual characteristics of Wikipedia can be utilized to annotate a large corpus of text with Named Entity Recognition (NER) tags requiring minimal human intervention and no linguistic expertise. This process, though of value in languages for which resources exist, is particularly useful for less commonly taught languages. We show how the Wikipedia format can be used to identify possible named entities and discuss in detail the process by which we use the Category structure inherent to Wikipedia to determine the named entity type of a proposed entity. We further describe the methods by which English language data can be used to bootstrap the NER process in other languages. We demonstrate the system by using the generated corpus as training sets for a variant of BBN's Identifinder in French, Ukrainian, Spanish, Polish, Russian, and Portuguese, achieving overall F-scores as high as 84.7% on independent, human-annotated corpora, comparable to a system trained on up to 40,000 words of human-annotated newswire.\n\n5. WikiNEuRal: Combined Neural and Knowledge-based Silver Data Creation for Multilingual NER\nMultilingual Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key intermediate task which is needed in many areas of NLP. In this paper, we address the well-known issue of data scarcity in NER, especially relevant when moving to a multilingual scenario, and go beyond current approaches to the creation of multilingual silver data for the task. We exploit the texts of Wikipedia and introduce a new methodology based on the effective combination of knowledge-based approaches and neural models, together with a novel domain adaptation technique, to produce high-quality training corpora for NER. We evaluate our datasets extensively on standard benchmarks for NER, yielding substantial improvements of up to 6 span-based F1-score points over previous state-of-the-art systems for data creation.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In addressing the challenge of multilingual named entity recognition (NER), recent studies have leveraged the wealth of data and metadata found in Wikipedia to enhance annotation methods. One approach involves using a semi-CRF model to integrate foreign sentence tags with English-language Wikipedia sentences, thereby improving upon traditional annotation projection methods (1). Another study demonstrated that Wikipedia's link structure could be used to automatically generate high-quality annotations, with the performance of annotated text outperforming models trained on newswire corpora (2). The WEXEA project extended this by creating a system that exhaustively annotates entity mentions in Wikipedia articles, linking them to their corresponding articles, thus providing a valuable corpus for downstream NLP tasks like relation extraction (3). Similarly, mining Wikipedia resources was shown to be an effective way to annotate large corpus with NER tags, utilizing the Category structure within Wikipedia to determine entity types and achieving high F-scores in various not-English languages (4). Lastly, the WikiNEuRal project introduced a methodology that combines neural models with knowledge-based approaches to create silver data for NER, significantly improving upon existing systems and achieving substantial improvements in performance (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the potential of Wikipedia as a founding corpus for multilingual NER, highlighting the importance of integrating knowledge graphs, neural networks, and domain adaptation to address data scarcity and improve annotation accuracy.\n\n",

Named Entity Recognition in Wikipedia\nNamed entity recognition (NER) is used in many domains beyond the newswire text that comprises current gold-standard corpora. Recent work has used Wikipedia's link structure to automatically generate near gold-standard annotations. Until now, these resources have only been evaluated on newswire corpora or themselves.    We present the first NER evaluation on a Wikipedia gold standard (WG) corpus. Our analysis of cross-corpus performance on WG shows that Wikipedia text may be a harder NER domain than newswire. We find that an automatic annotation of Wikipedia has high agreement with WG and, when used as training data, outperforms newswire models by up to 7.7%.\n\n3. WEXEA: Wikipedia EXhaustive Entity Annotation\nBuilding predictive models for information extraction from text, such as named entity recognition or the extraction of semantic relationships between named entities in text, requires a large corpus of annotated text. Wikipedia is often used as a corpus for these tasks where the annotation is a named entity linked by a hyperlink to its article. However, editors on Wikipedia are only expected to link these mentions in order to help the reader to understand the content, but are discouraged from adding links that do not add any benefit for understanding an article. Therefore, many mentions of popular entities (such as countries or popular events in history), or previously linked articles, as well as the article\u2019s entity itself, are not linked. In this paper, we discuss WEXEA, a Wikipedia EXhaustive Entity Annotation system, to create a text corpus based on Wikipedia with exhaustive annotations of entity mentions, i.e. linking all mentions of entities to their corresponding articles. This results in a huge potential for additional annotations that can be used for downstream NLP tasks, such as Relation Extraction. We show that our annotations are useful for creating distantly supervised datasets for this task. Furthermore, we publish all code necessary to derive a corpus from a raw Wikipedia dump, so that it can be reproduced by everyone.\n\n4. Mining Wiki Resources for Multilingual Named Entity Recognition\nIn this paper, we describe a system by which the multilingual characteristics of Wikipedia can be utilized to annotate a large corpus of text with Named Entity Recognition (NER) tags requiring minimal human intervention and no linguistic expertise. This process, though of value in languages for which resources exist, is particularly useful for less commonly taught languages. We show how the Wikipedia format can be used to identify possible named entities and discuss in detail the process by which we use the Category structure inherent to Wikipedia to determine the named entity type of a proposed entity. We further describe the methods by which English language data can be used to bootstrap the NER process in other languages. We demonstrate the system by using the generated corpus as training sets for a variant of BBN's Identifinder in French, Ukrainian, Spanish, Polish, Russian, and Portuguese, achieving overall F-scores as high as 84.7% on independent, human-annotated corpora, comparable to a system trained on up to 40,000 words of human-annotated newswire.\n\n5. WikiNEuRal: Combined Neural and Knowledge-based Silver Data Creation for Multilingual NER\nMultilingual Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key intermediate task which is needed in many areas of NLP. In this paper, we address the well-known issue of data scarcity in NER, especially relevant when moving to a multilingual scenario, and go beyond current approaches to the creation of multilingual silver data for the task. We exploit the texts of Wikipedia and introduce a new methodology based on the effective combination of knowledge-based approaches and neural models, together with a novel domain adaptation technique, to produce high-quality training corpora for NER. We evaluate our datasets extensively on standard benchmarks for NER, yielding substantial improvements of up to 6 span-based F1-score points over previous state-of-the-art systems for data creation.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " Recent advancements in multilingual named entity recognition (NER) have highlighted the pivotal role of thorough annotation and the utilization of existing knowledge resources, such as Wikipedia, to enhance the accuracy and comprehensiveness of NER systems. The integration of Wikipedia metadata with English-foreign language parallel data has shown to be a highly effective method for labeling multi-lingual data, outperforming traditional annotation projection methods and providing valuable insights into the challenges of NER in non-newswire domains (1). Similarly, the exhaustive annotation of Wikipedia text, known as WEXEA, has demonstrated the potential of linking popular entities and their articles, facilitating the creation of large corpora for downstream NLP tasks like relation extraction, and emphasizing the importance of comprehensively linking mentions of entities to their articles (3). Moreover, the utilization of the Wikipedia format for identifying possible named entities and determining their types has been shown to be a valuable method for annotating text in various less commonly taught languages, with achieved F-scores indicating high accuracy (4). The combined application of neural models and knowledge-based approaches, as seen in WikiNEuRal, has further advanced the creation of multilingual silver data, significantly improving NER performance across different domains (5). These studies collectively underscore the significance of leveraging existing knowledge structures and employing innovative annotation strategies to address the data scarcity challenges in multilingual NER, ultimately enhancing the field's capability to understand and process linguistically diverse texts (1, 3, 4, 5).",

Learning words in nonostensive contexts.\nFour word learning studies with 24-month-old children are reported. In Studies 1 and 2, an adult used a novel word to announce her intention to perform an action or to find an object. It was found that a knowledge of what action or object was impending \u2015 established through scripted events before the word's introduction \u2015 was not necessary for children to learn the words. Studies 3 and 4 focused on what word learning cues children might be using in these contexts. In Study 3, it was found that children learned a novel verb for an intentional and not an accidental action. In Study 4, it was found that children learned a novel noun for an object the adult was searching for, not ones she had rejected while searching\n\n2. Two-year-olds learn words for absent objects and actions\nTwo studies of word learning in 24-month-old children are reported, one involving an object word (Study 1) and one involving an action word (Study 2). In both studies, non-verbal scripts of playing with novel objects/actions in particular ways were established before the child was exposed to any language models. Following this pre-training, children heard an experimenter announce her intention to either find an object or perform an action. In the referent condition, children then saw the intended referent (object or action) immediately after hearing the language model. Children in the absent referent condition experienced the same non-verbal scripts and language models, but never saw the referent object or action after hearing the language model: at the appropriate juncture in the script they were told that the toy barn in which the target object had been previously located was \u201clocked\u201d, or that the toy character who had previously performed the target action was missing. Comparisons with two control conditions indicated that children were able to learn words for a novel object and a novel action in both the referent and absent referent conditions and, moreover, that learning was equivalent in these two conditions. These results show quite clearly that early lexical acquisition does not depend on temporal contiguity between word and referent\u2014or indeed any perceptual pairing between word and referent at all\u2014but rather it relies on children's active understandings of a speaker's referential intentions in particular discourse contexts.\n\n3. Phonotactic Constraints on Infant Word Learning: PHONOTACTIC CONSTRAINTS ON INFANT WORD LEARNING\nHow do infants use their knowledge of native language sound patterns when learning words? There is ample evidence of infants' precocious acquisition of native language sound structure during the first years of life, but much less evidence concerning how they apply this knowledge to the task of associating sounds with meanings in word learning. To address this question, 18-month-olds were presented with two phonotactically legal object labels (containing sound sequences that occur frequently in English) or two phonotactically illegal object labels (containing sound sequences that never occur in English), paired with novel objects. Infants were then tested using a looking-while-listening measure. The results revealed that infants looked at the correct objects after hearing the legal labels, but not the illegal labels. Furthermore, vocabulary size was related to performance. Infants with larger receptive vocabularies displayed greater differences between learning of legal and illegal labels than infants with smaller vocabularies. These findings provide evidence that infants' knowledge of native language sound patterns influences their word learning.\n\n4. The Interplay of Cross-Situational Word Learning and Sentence-Level Constraints\nA variety of mechanisms contribute to word learning. Learners can track co-occurring words and referents across situations in a bottom-up manner (cross-situational word learning, CSWL). Equally, they can exploit sentential contexts, relying on top-down information such as verb-argument relations and world knowledge, offering immediate constraints on meaning (word learning based on sentence-level constraints, SLCL). When combined, CSWL and SLCL potentially modulate each other's influence, revealing how word learners deal with multiple mechanisms simultaneously: Do they use all mechanisms? Prefer one? Is their strategy context dependent? Three experiments conducted with adult learners reveal that learners prioritize SLCL over CSWL. CSWL is applied in addition to SLCL only if SLCL is not perfectly disambiguating, thereby complementing or competing with it. These studies demonstrate the importance of investigating word-learning mechanisms simultaneously, revealing important characteristics of their interaction in more naturalistic learning environments.\n\n5. Infants' ability to consult the speaker for clues to word reference\nABSTRACTThis research examines whether infants actively seek information from a speaker regarding the referent of the speaker's utterance. Forty-eight infants (in three age groups: 1;2\u20131;3, 1;4\u20131;5, and 1;6\u20131;7) heard novel labels for novel objects in two situations: follow-in labelling (the experimenter looked at and labelled the toy of the infant's focus) vs. discrepant labelling (the experimenter looked at and labelled a different toy than that of the infant's focus). Subsequently, half of the infants were asked comprehension questions (e.g. \u2018Where's the peri?\u2019). The other half were asked preference questions (e.g. \u2018Where's the one you like?\u2019), to ensure that their comprehension performance was not merely the result of preferential responding. The comprehension results revealed developmental change in both (a) infants' ability to establish new word-object mappings (infants aged 1;2\u20131;3 failed to establish stable word-object links even in follow-in labelling), and (b) infants' ability to pinpoint the correct referent during discrepant labelling (only infants aged 1;6\u20131;7 succeeded). Thus the period between 1;2 and 1;7 represents a time of change in infants' ability to establish new word-object mappings: infants are becoming increasingly adept at acquiring new labels under minimal learning conditions.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In exploring the effects of joint attention violations on mapping processes, the methodologies employed across five studies offer insights into how infants and young children learn words and associate them with objects or actions. Study 1 and Study 2 utilized non-verbal scripts to introduce novel words and actions, then exposed participants to language models followed by actual referents, creating a referent condition and an absent referent condition, which allowed for comparisons in learning outcomes (1, 2). This approach was complemented by Study 3, which focused on phonotactic constraints, presenting infants with phonotactically legal and illegal labels, and measuring their word learning through looking-while-listening measures, reflecting the role of native language sound patterns in word learning (3). Studies 4 and 5 adopted a mixed methodology, combining cross-situational word learning with sentence-level constraints to investigate how infants use multiple mechanisms to learn words, revealing the priority given to sentence-level constraints when these are available (4, 5). Collectively, these methodologies highlight the importance of context, scripted events, and linguistic constraints in the process of word learning, offering a nuanced understanding of how joint attention violations may impact this process.\n\n",

Learning words in nonostensive contexts.\nFour word learning studies with 24-month-old children are reported. In Studies 1 and 2, an adult used a novel word to announce her intention to perform an action or to find an object. It was found that a knowledge of what action or object was impending \u2015 established through scripted events before the word's introduction \u2015 was not necessary for children to learn the words. Studies 3 and 4 focused on what word learning cues children might be using in these contexts. In Study 3, it was found that children learned a novel verb for an intentional and not an accidental action. In Study 4, it was found that children learned a novel noun for an object the adult was searching for, not ones she had rejected while searching\n\n2. Two-year-olds learn words for absent objects and actions\nTwo studies of word learning in 24-month-old children are reported, one involving an object word (Study 1) and one involving an action word (Study 2). In both studies, non-verbal scripts of playing with novel objects/actions in particular ways were established before the child was exposed to any language models. Following this pre-training, children heard an experimenter announce her intention to either find an object or perform an action. In the referent condition, children then saw the intended referent (object or action) immediately after hearing the language model. Children in the absent referent condition experienced the same non-verbal scripts and language models, but never saw the referent object or action after hearing the language model: at the appropriate juncture in the script they were told that the toy barn in which the target object had been previously located was \u201clocked\u201d, or that the toy character who had previously performed the target action was missing. Comparisons with two control conditions indicated that children were able to learn words for a novel object and a novel action in both the referent and absent referent conditions and, moreover, that learning was equivalent in these two conditions. These results show quite clearly that early lexical acquisition does not depend on temporal contiguity between word and referent\u2014or indeed any perceptual pairing between word and referent at all\u2014but rather it relies on children's active understandings of a speaker's referential intentions in particular discourse contexts.\n\n3. Phonotactic Constraints on Infant Word Learning: PHONOTACTIC CONSTRAINTS ON INFANT WORD LEARNING\nHow do infants use their knowledge of native language sound patterns when learning words? There is ample evidence of infants' precocious acquisition of native language sound structure during the first years of life, but much less evidence concerning how they apply this knowledge to the task of associating sounds with meanings in word learning. To address this question, 18-month-olds were presented with two phonotactically legal object labels (containing sound sequences that occur frequently in English) or two phonotactically illegal object labels (containing sound sequences that never occur in English), paired with novel objects. Infants were then tested using a looking-while-listening measure. The results revealed that infants looked at the correct objects after hearing the legal labels, but not the illegal labels. Furthermore, vocabulary size was related to performance. Infants with larger receptive vocabularies displayed greater differences between learning of legal and illegal labels than infants with smaller vocabularies. These findings provide evidence that infants' knowledge of native language sound patterns influences their word learning.\n\n4. The Interplay of Cross-Situational Word Learning and Sentence-Level Constraints\nA variety of mechanisms contribute to word learning. Learners can track co-occurring words and referents across situations in a bottom-up manner (cross-situational word learning, CSWL). Equally, they can exploit sentential contexts, relying on top-down information such as verb-argument relations and world knowledge, offering immediate constraints on meaning (word learning based on sentence-level constraints, SLCL). When combined, CSWL and SLCL potentially modulate each other's influence, revealing how word learners deal with multiple mechanisms simultaneously: Do they use all mechanisms? Prefer one? Is their strategy context dependent? Three experiments conducted with adult learners reveal that learners prioritize SLCL over CSWL. CSWL is applied in addition to SLCL only if SLCL is not perfectly disambiguating, thereby complementing or competing with it. These studies demonstrate the importance of investigating word-learning mechanisms simultaneously, revealing important characteristics of their interaction in more naturalistic learning environments.\n\n5. Infants' ability to consult the speaker for clues to word reference\nABSTRACTThis research examines whether infants actively seek information from a speaker regarding the referent of the speaker's utterance. Forty-eight infants (in three age groups: 1;2\u20131;3, 1;4\u20131;5, and 1;6\u20131;7) heard novel labels for novel objects in two situations: follow-in labelling (the experimenter looked at and labelled the toy of the infant's focus) vs. discrepant labelling (the experimenter looked at and labelled a different toy than that of the infant's focus). Subsequently, half of the infants were asked comprehension questions (e.g. \u2018Where's the peri?\u2019). The other half were asked preference questions (e.g. \u2018Where's the one you like?\u2019), to ensure that their comprehension performance was not merely the result of preferential responding. The comprehension results revealed developmental change in both (a) infants' ability to establish new word-object mappings (infants aged 1;2\u20131;3 failed to establish stable word-object links even in follow-in labelling), and (b) infants' ability to pinpoint the correct referent during discrepant labelling (only infants aged 1;6\u20131;7 succeeded). Thus the period between 1;2 and 1;7 represents a time of change in infants' ability to establish new word-object mappings: infants are becoming increasingly adept at acquiring new labels under minimal learning conditions.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " Recent studies have highlighted the nuanced processes involved in word learning, revealing that infants and young children can learn words effectively even in non-ostensive contexts and without direct temporal contiguity between word and referent (1, 2). Research has demonstrated that infants' knowledge of native language sound patterns, acquired precisely, influences their word learning, as evidenced by their better performance in associating sounds with meanings when exposed to phonotactically legal labels compared to illegal ones (3). The interplay between cross-situational word learning and sentence-level constraints has been shown to be dynamic, with learners utilizing multiple mechanisms simultaneously, although the priority given to each mechanism may vary (4). Furthermore, infants have been found to actively seek information from speakers regarding word reference, displaying developmental changes in their ability to establish new word-object mappings as they grow older (5). These findings collectively suggest that while there is no single definitive method for mapping words to referents, infants and young children employ a combination of strategies, leveraging their linguistic knowledge and interactive experiences to acquire language effectively.\n\n",

        "inference": " In the realm of word learning, the five studies provide diverse insights into the processes involved and the factors influencing them. The first study found that even 24-month-olds can learn novel words when introduced by an adult, without requiring direct experience of the action or object, suggesting that their understanding of the speaker's intent is key to learning (1). The second study demonstrated that two-year-olds can learn words for absent objects and actions, indicating that they can infer meaning based on a speaker's referential intentions, regardless of immediate visual cues (2). The third study revealed that infants' knowledge of native language sound patterns influences their word learning, with greater vocabulary size correlating with better performance in learning phonotactically legal labels, suggesting that familiarity with phonological structures aids in associating sounds with meanings (3). The fourth study suggested that learners prioritize sentence-level constraints over cross-situational word learning, suggesting that context-specific information is crucial for word learning, and that both mechanisms are applied simultaneously but with one potentially modifying the other (4). Lastly, the fifth study showed developmental changes in infants' ability to establish word-object mappings, with older infants more adept at acquiring new labels under minimal learning conditions, indicating a growth in their ability to map words to objects through speaker cues (5). Together, these studies underscore the complexity of mapping processes and the multiple factors influencing word learning, from phonological knowledge to inferential reasoning.",

Decentralised runtime monitoring for access control systems in cloud federations\nCloud federation is an emergent cloud-computing paradigm where partner organisations share data and services hosted on their own cloud platforms. In this context, it is crucial to enforce access control policies that satisfy data protection and privacy requirements of partner organisations.

FairAccess: a new Blockchain-based access control framework for the Internet of Things\nSecurity and privacy are huge challenges in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, but unfortunately, the harmonization of the IoT-related standards and protocols is hardly and slowly widespread. In this paper, we propose a new framework for access control in IoT based on the blockchain technology. Our first contribution consists in providing a reference model for our proposed framework within the Objectives, Models, Architecture and Mechanism specification in IoT. In addition, we introduce FairAccess as a fully decentralized pseudonymous and privacy preserving authorization management framework that enables users to own and control their data. To implement our model, we use and adapt the blockchain into a decentralized access control manager. Unlike financial bitcoin transactions, FairAccess introduces new types of transactions that are used to grant, get, delegate, and revoke access. As a proof of concept, we establish an initial implementation with a Raspberry PI device and local blockchain. Finally, we discuss some limitations and propose further opportunities.

Provchain: A blockchain-based data provenance architecture in cloud environment with enhanced privacy and availability\nCloud data provenance is metadata that records the history of the creation and operations performed on a cloud data object. Secure data provenance is crucial for data accountability, forensics and privacy. In this paper, we propose a decentralized and trusted cloud data provenance architecture using blockchain technology. Blockchain-based data provenance can provide tamper-proof records, enable the transparency of data accountability in the cloud, and help to enhance the privacy and availability of the provenance data. We make use of the cloud storage scenario and choose the cloud file as a data unit to detect user operations for collecting provenance data. We design and implement ProvChain, an architecture to collect and verify cloud data provenance, by embedding the provenance data into blockchain transactions. ProvChain operates mainly in three phases: (1) provenance data collection, (2) provenance data storage, and (3) provenance data validation. Results from performance evaluation demonstrate that ProvChain provides security features including tamper-proof provenance, user privacy and reliability with low overhead for the cloud storage applications.\n\n4.

Enigma's computational model is based on a highly optimized version of secure multi-party computation, guaranteed by a verifiable secret-sharing scheme. For storage, we use a modified distributed hashtable for holding secret-shared data. An external blockchain is utilized as the controller of the network, manages access control, identities and serves as a tamper-proof log of events. Security deposits and fees incentivize operation, correctness and fairness of the system. Similar to Bitcoin, Enigma removes the need for a trusted third party, enabling autonomous control of personal data. For the first time, users are able to share their data with cryptographic guarantees regarding their privacy.\n\n5. BBDS: Blockchain-based data sharing for electronic medical records in cloud environments\nDisseminating medical data beyond the protected cloud of institutions poses severe risks to patients\u2019 privacy, as breaches push them to the point where they abstain from full disclosure of their condition. This situation negatively impacts the patient, scientific research, and all stakeholders. To address this challenge, we propose a blockchain-based data sharing framework that sufficiently addresses the access control challenges associated with sensitive data stored in the cloud using immutability and built-in autonomy properties of the blockchain. Our system is based on a permissioned blockchain which allows access to only invited, and hence verified users. As a result of this design, further accountability is guaranteed as all users are already known and a log of their actions is kept by the blockchain. The system permits users to request data from the shared pool after their identities and cryptographic keys are verified. The evidence from the system evaluation shows that our scheme is lightweight, scalable, and efficient.\n\n###\n\n",

Porous ZnO Polygonal Nanoflakes: Synthesis, Use in High-Sensitivity NO2 Gas Sensor, and Proposed Mechanism of Gas Sensing\nUnique porous ZnO polygonal nanoflakes were synthesized by the microwave hydrothermal method. The structural properties of the products were investigated by using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution TEM techniques. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy technique was employed to investigate the mechanism of NO2 sensing. Free nitrate ions, nitrate ions, and nitrite anions were the main adsorbed species. N2O was formed via NO\u2013 and N2O2\u2013 that were stemmed from NO. Comparative tests for gas sensing between gas sensors based on the as-prepared porous ZnO nanoflakes and purchased ZnO nanoparticles clearly showed that the former exhibited more excellent NO2 sensing performances. Photoluminescence and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra further proved that the intensities of donors (oxygen vacancy (VO) and/or zinc interstitial (Zni)) and surface oxygen species (O2\u2013 and O2), which were involved in the mechani...\n\n2. Black Phosphorus Gas Sensors\nThe utilization of black phosphorus and its monolayer (phosphorene) and few-layers in field-effect transistors has attracted a lot of attention to this elemental two-dimensional material. Various studies on optimization of black phosphorus field-effect transistors, PN junctions, photodetectors, and other applications have been demonstrated. Although chemical sensing based on black phosphorus devices was theoretically predicted, there is still no experimental verification of such an important study of this material. In this article, we report on chemical sensing of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) using field-effect transistors based on multilayer black phosphorus. Black phosphorus sensors exhibited increased conduction upon NO2 exposure and excellent sensitivity for detection of NO2 down to 5 ppb. Moreover, when the multilayer black phosphorus field-effect transistor was exposed to NO2 concentrations of 5, 10, 20, and 40 ppb, its relative conduction change followed the Langmuir isotherm for molecules adsorbed on a surface. Additionally, on the basis of an exponential conductance change, the rate constants for adsorption and desorption of NO2 on black phosphorus were extracted for different NO2 concentrations, and they were in the range of 130-840 s. These results shed light on important electronic and sensing characteristics of black phosphorus, which can be utilized in future studies and applications.\n\n3. Graphene Nanomesh As Highly Sensitive Chemiresistor Gas Sensor\nGraphene is a one atom thick carbon allotrope with all surface atoms that has attracted significant attention as a promising material as the conduction channel of a field-effect transistor and chemical field-effect transistor sensors. However, the zero bandgap of semimetal graphene still limits its application for these devices. In this work, ethanol-chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of a grown p-type semiconducting large-area monolayer graphene film was patterned into a nanomesh by the combination of nanosphere lithography and reactive ion etching and evaluated as a field-effect transistor and chemiresistor gas sensors. The resulting neck-width of the synthesized nanomesh was about \u223c20 nm and was comprised of the gap between polystyrene (PS) spheres that was formed during the reactive ion etching (RIE) process. The neck-width and the periodicities of the graphene nanomesh (GNM) could be easily controlled depending on the duration/power of the RIE and the size of the PS nanospheres. The fabricated GNM transistor device exhibited promising electronic properties featuring a high drive current and an I(ON)/I(OFF) ratio of about 6, significantly higher than its film counterpart. Similarly, when applied as a chemiresistor gas sensor at room temperature, the graphene nanomesh sensor showed excellent sensitivity toward NO(2) and NH(3), significantly higher than their film counterparts. The ethanol-based graphene nanomesh sensors exhibited sensitivities of about 4.32%/ppm in NO(2) and 0.71%/ppm in NH(3) with limits of detection of 15 and 160 ppb, respectively. Our demonstrated studies on controlling the neck width of the nanomesh would lead to further improvement of graphene-based transistors and sensors.\n\n4. Physisorption-Based Charge Transfer in Two-Dimensional SnS2 for Selective and Reversible NO2 Gas Sensing\nNitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a gas species that plays an important role in certain industrial, farming, and healthcare sectors. However, there are still significant challenges for NO2 sensing at low detection limits, especially in the presence of other interfering gases. The NO2 selectivity of current gas-sensing technologies is significantly traded-off with their sensitivity and reversibility as well as fabrication and operating costs. In this work, we present an important progress for selective and reversible NO2 sensing by demonstrating an economical sensing platform based on the charge transfer between physisorbed NO2 gas molecules and two-dimensional (2D) tin disulfide (SnS2) flakes at low operating temperatures. The device shows high sensitivity and superior selectivity to NO2 at operating temperatures of less than 160 \u00b0C, which are well below those of chemisorptive and ion conductive NO2 sensors with much poorer selectivity. At the same time, excellent reversibility of the sensor is demonstrated, which has rarely been observed in other 2D material counterparts. Such impressive features originate from the planar morphology of 2D SnS2 as well as unique physical affinity and favorable electronic band positions of this material that facilitate the NO2 physisorption and charge transfer at parts per billion levels. The 2D SnS2-based sensor provides a real solution for low-cost and selective NO2 gas sensing.\n\n5. Sensing Behavior of Atomically Thin-Layered MoS2 Transistors\nMost of recent research on layered chalcogenides is understandably focused on single atomic layers. However, it is unclear if single-layer units are the most ideal structures for enhanced gas-solid interactions. To probe this issue further, we have prepared large-area MoS2 sheets ranging from single to multiple layers on 300 nm SiO2/Si substrates using the micromechanical exfoliation method. The thickness and layering of the sheets were identified by optical microscope, invoking recently reported specific optical color contrast, and further confirmed by AFM and Raman spectroscopy. The MoS2 transistors with different thicknesses were assessed for gas-sensing performances with exposure to NO2, NH3, and humidity in different conditions such as gate bias and light irradiation. The results show that, compared to the single-layer counterpart, transistors of few MoS2 layers exhibit excellent sensitivity, recovery, and ability to be manipulated by gate bias and green light. Further, our ab initio DFT calculations on single-layer and bilayer MoS2 show that the charge transfer is the reason for the decrease in resistance in the presence of applied field.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of chemical sensors, recent methodologies have focused on the synthesis and application of nanomaterials to enhance sensitivity and selectivity for specific gases. The microwave hydrothermal method was employed to synthesize porous ZnO polygonal nanoflakes, which were then used for NO2 gas sensing, demonstrating superior performance to commercial ZnO nanoparticles (1). Similarly, black phosphorus was utilized for NO2 detection through field-effect transistors, with the ability to detect concentrations as low as 5 ppb, showcasing the potential for high-sensitivity applications (2). Graphene nanomesh, patterned through nanosphere lithography and reactive ion etching, was shown to significantly improve chemical field-effect transistor performance due to its controllable neck-width, leading to higher I(ON)/I(OFF) ratios (3). Two-dimensional SnS2 was explored for NO2 sensing, leveraging the physisorption-based charge transfer mechanism at low operating temperatures, resulting in high sensitivity and selectivity (4). Lastly, MoS2 transistors of varying thickness were tested for gas sensing, with multi-layer devices exhibiting better sensitivity, recovery, and manipulation by gate bias and light irradiation, suggesting that multiple layers can optimize gas-solid interactions (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the importance of material selection, nanostructuring, and controlled synthesis in advancing the field of chemical sensors.",

Photoluminescence and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra further proved that the intensities of donors (oxygen vacancy (VO) and/or zinc interstitial (Zni)) and surface oxygen species (O2\u2013 and O2), which were involved in the mechani...\n\n2. Black Phosphorus Gas Sensors\nThe utilization of black phosphorus and its monolayer (phosphorene) and few-layers in field-effect transistors has attracted a lot of attention to this elemental two-dimensional material. Various studies on optimization of black phosphorus field-effect transistors, PN junctions, photodetectors, and other applications have been demonstrated. Although chemical sensing based on black phosphorus devices was theoretically predicted, there is still no experimental verification of such an important study of this material. In this article, we report on chemical sensing of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) using field-effect transistors based on multilayer black phosphorus. Black phosphorus sensors exhibited increased conduction upon NO2 exposure and excellent sensitivity for detection of NO2 down to 5 ppb. Moreover, when the multilayer black phosphorus field-effect transistor was exposed to NO2 concentrations of 5, 10, 20, and 40 ppb, its relative conduction change followed the Langmuir isotherm for molecules adsorbed on a surface. Additionally, on the basis of an exponential conductance change, the rate constants for adsorption and desorption of NO2 on black phosphorus were extracted for different NO2 concentrations, and they were in the range of 130-840 s. These results shed light on important electronic and sensing characteristics of black phosphorus, which can be utilized in future studies and applications.\n\n3. Graphene Nanomesh As Highly Sensitive Chemiresistor Gas Sensor\nGraphene is a one atom thick carbon allotrope with all surface atoms that has attracted significant attention as a promising material as the conduction channel of a field-effect transistor and chemical field-effect transistor sensors. However, the zero bandgap of semimetal graphene still limits its application for these devices. In this work, ethanol-chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of a grown p-type semiconducting large-area monolayer graphene film was patterned into a nanomesh by the combination of nanosphere lithography and reactive ion etching and evaluated as a field-effect transistor and chemiresistor gas sensors. The resulting neck-width of the synthesized nanomesh was about \u223c20 nm and was comprised of the gap between polystyrene (PS) spheres that was formed during the reactive ion etching (RIE) process. The neck-width and the periodicities of the graphene nanomesh (GNM) could be easily controlled depending on the duration/power of the RIE and the size of the PS nanospheres. The fabricated GNM transistor device exhibited promising electronic properties featuring a high drive current and an I(ON)/I(OFF) ratio of about 6, significantly higher than its film counterpart. Similarly, when applied as a chemiresistor gas sensor at room temperature, the graphene nanomesh sensor showed excellent sensitivity toward NO(2) and NH(3), significantly higher than their film counterparts. The ethanol-based graphene nanomesh sensors exhibited sensitivities of about 4.32%/ppm in NO(2) and 0.71%/ppm in NH(3) with limits of detection of 15 and 160 ppb, respectively. Our demonstrated studies on controlling the neck width of the nanomesh would lead to further improvement of graphene-based transistors and sensors.\n\n4. Physisorption-Based Charge Transfer in Two-Dimensional SnS2 for Selective and Reversible NO2 Gas Sensing\nNitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a gas species that plays an important role in certain industrial, farming, and healthcare sectors. However, there are still significant challenges for NO2 sensing at low detection limits, especially in the presence of other interfering gases. The NO2 selectivity of current gas-sensing technologies is significantly traded-off with their sensitivity and reversibility as well as fabrication and operating costs. In this work, we present an important progress for selective and reversible NO2 sensing by demonstrating an economical sensing platform based on the charge transfer between physisorbed NO2 gas molecules and two-dimensional (2D) tin disulfide (SnS2) flakes at low operating temperatures. The device shows high sensitivity and superior selectivity to NO2 at operating temperatures of less than 160 \u00b0C, which are well below those of chemisorptive and ion conductive NO2 sensors with much poorer selectivity. At the same time, excellent reversibility of the sensor is demonstrated, which has rarely been observed in other 2D material counterparts. Such impressive features originate from the planar morphology of 2D SnS2 as well as unique physical affinity and favorable electronic band positions of this material that facilitate the NO2 physisorption and charge transfer at parts per billion levels. The 2D SnS2-based sensor provides a real solution for low-cost and selective NO2 gas sensing.\n\n5. Sensing Behavior of Atomically Thin-Layered MoS2 Transistors\nMost of recent research on layered chalcogenides is understandably focused on single atomic layers. However, it is unclear if single-layer units are the most ideal structures for enhanced gas-solid interactions. To probe this issue further, we have prepared large-area MoS2 sheets ranging from single to multiple layers on 300 nm SiO2/Si substrates using the micromechanical exfoliation method. The thickness and layering of the sheets were identified by optical microscope, invoking recently reported specific optical color contrast, and further confirmed by AFM and Raman spectroscopy. The MoS2 transistors with different thicknesses were assessed for gas-sensing performances with exposure to NO2, NH3, and humidity in different conditions such as gate bias and light irradiation. The results show that, compared to the single-layer counterpart, transistors of few MoS2 layers exhibit excellent sensitivity, recovery, and ability to be manipulated by gate bias and green light. Further, our ab initio DFT calculations on single-layer and bilayer MoS2 show that the charge transfer is the reason for the decrease in resistance in the presence of applied field.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of chemical sensors, recent advancements have been made in the development of highly sensitive devices utilizing porous ZnO nanoflakes (1), black phosphorus (2), and graphene nanomesh (3), each offering unique mechanisms and applications. The synthesis of porous ZnO polygonal nanoflakes through microwave hydrothermal methods has led to the creation of NO2 gas sensors with superior sensitivity, as evidenced by their ability to detect nitrate ions and nitrite anions, forming N2O (1). Similarly, black phosphorus has emerged as a promising material for gas sensors, with field-effect transistors demonstrating excellent sensitivity down to 5 ppb of NO2, and the potential for optimization in future applications due to its electronic and sensing characteristics (2). Graphene nanomesh has been patterned using ethanol-CVD to create chemiresistor gas sensors that outperform their film counterparts, achieving high sensitivity and low detection limits, particularly for NO2 and NH3, with a focus on controlling the neck-width for enhanced electronics (3). Meanwhile, two-dimensional SnS2 has been studied for selective and reversible NO2 gas sensing, leveraging the material's unique physisorption properties and charge transfer mechanisms at low temperatures, which could significantly reduce operating costs and enhance selectivity in gas-sensing applications (4). Lastly, MoS2 transistors have been explored, with few-layer sheets demonstrating superior sensitivity and recovery compared to single-layer counterparts, suggesting that multiple layers could lead to improved gas-solid interactions in transistor-based sensors (5). Each of these studies contributes to the advancement of chemical sensing technologies, offering insights into material selection, synthesis methods, and sensing mechanics for diverse gas detectors.",

Problem solving treatment and group psychoeducation for depression: multicentre randomised controlled trial. Outcomes of Depression International Network (ODIN) Group\nAbstract Objectives: To determine the acceptability of two psychological interventions for depressed adults in the community and their effect on caseness, symptoms, and subjective function. Design: A pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial, stratified by centre. Setting: Nine urban and rural communities in Finland, Republic of Ireland, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Participants: 452 participants aged 18 to 65, identified through a community survey with depressive or adjustment disorders according to the international classification of diseases, 10th revision or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition. Interventions: Six individual sessions of problem solving treatment (n=128), eight group sessions of the course on prevention of depression (n=108), and controls (n=189). Main outcome measures: Completion rates for each intervention, diagnosis of depression, and depressive symptoms and subjective function. Results: 63% of participants assigned to problem solving and 44% assigned to prevention of depression completed their intervention. The proportion of problem solving participants depressed at six months was 17% less than that for controls, giving a number needed to treat of 6; the mean difference in Beck depression inventory score was \u22122.63 (95% confidence interval \u22124.95 to \u22120.32), and there were significant improvements in SF-36 scores. For depression prevention, the difference in proportions of depressed participants was 14% (number needed to treat of 7); the mean difference in Beck depression inventory score was \u22121.50 (\u22124.16 to 1.17), and there were significant improvements in SF-36 scores. Such differences were not observed at 12 months. Neither specific diagnosis nor treatment with antidepressants affected outcome. Conclusions: When offered to adults with depressive disorders in the community, problem solving treatment was more acceptable than the course on prevention of depression. Both interventions reduced caseness and improved subjective function.\n\n2. Randomised controlled trial comparing problem solving treatment with amitriptyline and placebo for major depression in primary care\nAbstract Objective: To determine whether, in the treatment of major depression in primary care, a brief psychological treatment (problem solving) was (a) as effective as antidepressant drugs and more effective than placebo; (b) feasible in practice; and (c) acceptable to patients. Design: Randomised controlled trial of problem solving treatment, amitriptyline plus standard clinical management, and drug placebo plus standard clinical management. Each treatment was delivered in six sessions over 12 weeks. Setting: Primary care in Oxfordshire. Subjects: 91 patients in primary care who had major depression. Main outcome measures: Observer and self reported measures of severity of depression, self reported measure of social outcome, and observer measure of psychological symptoms at six and 12 weeks; self reported measure of patient satisfaction at 12 weeks. Numbers of patients recovered at six and 12 weeks. Results: At six and 12 weeks the difference in score on the Hamilton rating scale for depression between problem solving and placebo treatments was significant (5.3 (95% confidence interval 1.6 to 9.0) and 4.7 (0.4 to 9.0) respectively), but the difference between problem solving and amitriptyline was not significant (1.8 (\u22121.8 to 5.5) and 0.9 (\u22123.3 to 5.2) respectively). At 12 weeks 60% (18/30) of patients given problem solving treatment had recovered on the Hamilton scale compared with 52% (16/31) given amitriptyline and 27% (8/30) given placebo. Patients were satisfied with problem solving treatment; all patients who completed treatment (28/30) rated the treatment as helpful or very helpful. The six sessions of problem solving treatment totalled a mean therapy time of 3 1/2 hours. Conclusions: As a treatment for major depression in primary care, problem solving treatment is effective, feasible, and acceptable to patients. Key messages Key messages Patient compliance with antidepressant treatment is often poor, so there is a need for a psychological treatment This study found that problem solving is an effective psychological treatment for major depression in primary care\u2014as effective as amitriptyline and more effective than placebo Problem solving is a feasible treatment in primary care, being effective when given over six sessions by a general practitioner Problem solving treatment is acceptable to patients\n\n3. Telephone psychotherapy and telephone care management for primary care patients starting antidepressant treatment: a randomized controlled trial\nCONTEXT Both antidepressant medication and structured psychotherapy have been proven efficacious, but less than one third of people with depressive disorders receive effective levels of either treatment.   OBJECTIVE To compare usual primary care for depression with 2 intervention programs: telephone care management and telephone care management plus telephone psychotherapy.   DESIGN Three-group randomized controlled trial with allocation concealment and blinded outcome assessment conducted between November 2000 and May 2002.   SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 600 patients beginning antidepressant treatment for depression were systematically sampled from 7 group-model primary care clinics; patients already receiving psychotherapy were excluded.   INTERVENTIONS Usual primary care; usual care plus a telephone care management program including at least 3 outreach calls, feedback to the treating physician, and care coordination; usual care plus care management integrated with a structured 8-session cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy program delivered by telephone.   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Blinded telephone interviews at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months assessed depression severity (Hopkins Symptom Checklist Depression Scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire), patient-rated improvement, and satisfaction with treatment. Computerized administrative data examined use of antidepressant medication and outpatient visits.   RESULTS Treatment participation rates were 97% for telephone care management and 93% for telephone care management plus psychotherapy. Compared with usual care, the telephone psychotherapy intervention led to lower mean Hopkins Symptom Checklist Depression Scale depression scores (P =.02), a higher proportion of patients reporting that depression was \"much improved\" (80% vs 55%, P<.001), and a higher proportion of patients \"very satisfied\" with depression treatment (59% vs 29%, P<.001). The telephone care management program had smaller effects on patient-rated improvement (66% vs 55%, P =.04) and satisfaction (47% vs 29%, P =.001); effects on mean depression scores were not statistically significant.   CONCLUSIONS For primary care patients beginning antidepressant treatment, a telephone program integrating care management and structured cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy can significantly improve satisfaction and clinical outcomes. These findings suggest a new public health model of psychotherapy for depression including active outreach and vigorous efforts to improve access to and motivation for treatment.\n\n4. Telephone-based treatment for family practice patients with mild depression\nThe need for treating milder forms of depression has recently been of increased interest. This was a randomized, controlled study to evaluate the effects of telephone-based problem-solving therapy for mild depression. Comparison groups were a treatment-as-usual group and another group receiving stress-management training by telephone. From 1,742 family practice patients screened for depression, 54 with mild depression entered the study. Treatment was provided by experienced family practice nurses, trained and supervised in the treatments. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was administered before and after the intervention period, and the Beck Depression Inventory and Duke Health Profile were administered at the end of the intervention period. Of the 36 subjects assigned to the problem-solving and stress-management groups, half dropped out early in the study. Five from the treatment-as-usual group were lost to follow-up. In the remaining subjects, there was a significant decrease in depression scores. There were no significant differences in the amount of decrease between the groups on any scores. The small sample and high dropout rate limit the interpretation of the findings. However, since all subjects tended to improve, regardless of treatment received, mild levels of depression may generally remit even without focal intervention, and watchful waiting may be a reasonable alternative for management.\n\n5. Acute and one-year outcome of a randomised controlled trial of brief cognitive therapy for major depressive disorder in primary care\nBackgroundThe consensus statement on the treatment of depression (Paykel & Priest, 1992) advocates the use of cognitive therapy techniques as an adjunct to medication.MethodThis paper describes a randomised controlled trial of brief cognitive therapy (BCT) plus \u2018treatment as usual\u2019 versus treatment as usual in the management of 48 patients with major depressive disorder presenting in primary care.ResultsAt the end of the acute phase, significantly more subjects (P < 0.05) met recovery criteria in the intervention group (n=15) compared with the control group (n=8). When initial neuroticism scores were controlled for, reductions in Beck Depression Inventory and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores favoured the BCT group throughout the 12 months of follow-up.ConclusionsBCT may be beneficial, but given the time constraints, therapists need to be more rather than less skilled in cognitive therapy. This, plus methodological limitations, leads us to advise caution before applying this approach more widely in primary care.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " The methodologies employed across the five studies provide insights into the psychological treatments and their effectiveness for depression in primary care settings. The first study utilized a randomized controlled trial comparing problem-solving treatment with group psychoeducation, finding that the former was more acceptable and effective in reducing depressive symptoms and improving subjective function than the latter (1). The second study replicated this approach, confirming the efficacy of problem-solving treatment for major depression and highlighting its feasibility and patient acceptance (2). The third study introduced a teletherapy component, combining telephone care management with cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy, which significantly improved depression symptoms and patient satisfaction compared to usual care alone (3). A fourth study focused on mild depression, using a randomized controlled trial to evaluate telephone-based problem-solving therapy, although the small sample size and high dropout rate limit the generalizability of the findings (4). Lastly, the fifth study employed a randomized controlled trial of brief cognitive therapy plus treatment as usual, demonstrating superior outcomes in the intervention group and suggesting that cognitive therapists should be skilled in their application of cognitive techniques (5). Collectively, these methodologies underscore the potential of psychological interventions in the treatment of depression and the importance of offering a variety of evidence-based approaches to meet the needs of patients.\n\n",

Randomised controlled trial comparing problem solving treatment with amitriptyline and placebo for major depression in primary care\nAbstract Objective: To determine whether, in the treatment of major depression in primary care, a brief psychological treatment (problem solving) was (a) as effective as antidepressant drugs and more effective than placebo; (b) feasible in practice; and (c) acceptable to patients. Design: Randomised controlled trial of problem solving treatment, amitriptyline plus standard clinical management, and drug placebo plus standard clinical management. Each treatment was delivered in six sessions over 12 weeks. Setting: Primary care in Oxfordshire. Subjects: 91 patients in primary care who had major depression. Main outcome measures: Observer and self reported measures of severity of depression, self reported measure of social outcome, and observer measure of psychological symptoms at six and 12 weeks; self reported measure of patient satisfaction at 12 weeks. Numbers of patients recovered at six and 12 weeks. Results: At six and 12 weeks the difference in score on the Hamilton rating scale for depression between problem solving and placebo treatments was significant (5.3 (95% confidence interval 1.6 to 9.0) and 4.7 (0.4 to 9.0) respectively), but the difference between problem solving and amitriptyline was not significant (1.8 (\u22121.8 to 5.5) and 0.9 (\u22123.3 to 5.2) respectively). At 12 weeks 60% (18/30) of patients given problem solving treatment had recovered on the Hamilton scale compared with 52% (16/31) given amitriptyline and 27% (8/30) given placebo. Patients were satisfied with problem solving treatment; all patients who completed treatment (28/30) rated the treatment as helpful or very helpful. The six sessions of problem solving treatment totalled a mean therapy time of 3 1/2 hours. Conclusions: As a treatment for major depression in primary care, problem solving treatment is effective, feasible, and acceptable to patients. Key messages Key messages Patient compliance with antidepressant treatment is often poor, so there is a need for a psychological treatment This study found that problem solving is an effective psychological treatment for major depression in primary care\u2014as effective as amitriptyline and more effective than placebo Problem solving is a feasible treatment in primary care, being effective when given over six sessions by a general practitioner Problem solving treatment is acceptable to patients\n\n3. Telephone psychotherapy and telephone care management for primary care patients starting antidepressant treatment: a randomized controlled trial\nCONTEXT Both antidepressant medication and structured psychotherapy have been proven efficacious, but less than one third of people with depressive disorders receive effective levels of either treatment.   OBJECTIVE To compare usual primary care for depression with 2 intervention programs: telephone care management and telephone care management plus telephone psychotherapy.   DESIGN Three-group randomized controlled trial with allocation concealment and blinded outcome assessment conducted between November 2000 and May 2002.   SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 600 patients beginning antidepressant treatment for depression were systematically sampled from 7 group-model primary care clinics; patients already receiving psychotherapy were excluded.   INTERVENTIONS Usual primary care; usual care plus a telephone care management program including at least 3 outreach calls, feedback to the treating physician, and care coordination; usual care plus care management integrated with a structured 8-session cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy program delivered by telephone.   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Blinded telephone interviews at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months assessed depression severity (Hopkins Symptom Checklist Depression Scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire), patient-rated improvement, and satisfaction with treatment. Computerized administrative data examined use of antidepressant medication and outpatient visits.   RESULTS Treatment participation rates were 97% for telephone care management and 93% for telephone care management plus psychotherapy. Compared with usual care, the telephone psychotherapy intervention led to lower mean Hopkins Symptom Checklist Depression Scale depression scores (P =.02), a higher proportion of patients reporting that depression was \"much improved\" (80% vs 55%, P<.001), and a higher proportion of patients \"very satisfied\" with depression treatment (59% vs 29%, P<.001). The telephone care management program had smaller effects on patient-rated improvement (66% vs 55%, P =.04) and satisfaction (47% vs 29%, P =.001); effects on mean depression scores were not statistically significant.   CONCLUSIONS For primary care patients beginning antidepressant treatment, a telephone program integrating care management and structured cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy can significantly improve satisfaction and clinical outcomes. These findings suggest a new public health model of psychotherapy for depression including active outreach and vigorous efforts to improve access to and motivation for treatment.\n\n4. Telephone-based treatment for family practice patients with mild depression\nThe need for treating milder forms of depression has recently been of increased interest. This was a randomized, controlled study to evaluate the effects of telephone-based problem-solving therapy for mild depression. Comparison groups were a treatment-as-usual group and another group receiving stress-management training by telephone. From 1,742 family practice patients screened for depression, 54 with mild depression entered the study. Treatment was provided by experienced family practice nurses, trained and supervised in the treatments. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was administered before and after the intervention period, and the Beck Depression Inventory and Duke Health Profile were administered at the end of the intervention period. Of the 36 subjects assigned to the problem-solving and stress-management groups, half dropped out early in the study. Five from the treatment-as-usual group were lost to follow-up. In the remaining subjects, there was a significant decrease in depression scores. There were no significant differences in the amount of decrease between the groups on any scores. The small sample and high dropout rate limit the interpretation of the findings. However, since all subjects tended to improve, regardless of treatment received, mild levels of depression may generally remit even without focal intervention, and watchful waiting may be a reasonable alternative for management.\n\n5. Acute and one-year outcome of a randomised controlled trial of brief cognitive therapy for major depressive disorder in primary care\nBackgroundThe consensus statement on the treatment of depression (Paykel & Priest, 1992) advocates the use of cognitive therapy techniques as an adjunct to medication.MethodThis paper describes a randomised controlled trial of brief cognitive therapy (BCT) plus \u2018treatment as usual\u2019 versus treatment as usual in the management of 48 patients with major depressive disorder presenting in primary care.ResultsAt the end of the acute phase, significantly more subjects (P < 0.05) met recovery criteria in the intervention group (n=15) compared with the control group (n=8). When initial neuroticism scores were controlled for, reductions in Beck Depression Inventory and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores favoured the BCT group throughout the 12 months of follow-up.ConclusionsBCT may be beneficial, but given the time constraints, therapists need to be more rather than less skilled in cognitive therapy. This, plus methodological limitations, leads us to advise caution before applying this approach more widely in primary care.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " Recent studies have highlighted the effectiveness of psychotherapy in treating depression, with various psychological interventions showing promise in community-based settings. Problem-solving treatment and group psychoeducation have been found to reduce caseness and improve subjective function in depressed individuals, with a notable difference from control groups (1). Similarly, a randomized controlled trial comparing problem solving with amitriptyline and placebo for major depression in primary care has demonstrated that problem-solving treatment is as effective, feasible, and acceptable to patients as antidepressant drugs (2). The use of telephone psychotherapy, integrated with care management, has been shown to outperform usual primary care for patients starting antidepressant treatment, leading to lower depression scores and higher patient-reported improvements (3). Telephone-based problem-solving therapy has also been effective for treating mild depression, although the small sample size limits the generalizability of these findings (4). Finally, a randomized controlled trial of brief cognitive therapy for major depressive disorder in primary care has indicated that the intervention group showed significant improvements in depression scores at the end of the acute phase, with these effects persisting after one year (5). These studies collectively underscore the potential of psychotherapy in depression management and suggest that accessible, telephone-based treatments may be a viable option for providing effective assistance to those in need.",

Problem solving treatment and group psychoeducation for depression: multicentre randomised controlled trial. Outcomes of Depression International Network (ODIN) Group\nAbstract Objectives: To determine the acceptability of two psychological interventions for depressed adults in the community and their effect on caseness, symptoms, and subjective function. Design: A pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial, stratified by centre. Setting: Nine urban and rural communities in Finland, Republic of Ireland, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Participants: 452 participants aged 18 to 65, identified through a community survey with depressive or adjustment disorders according to the international classification of diseases, 10th revision or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition. Interventions: Six individual sessions of problem solving treatment (n=128), eight group sessions of the course on prevention of depression (n=108), and controls (n=189). Main outcome measures: Completion rates for each intervention, diagnosis of depression, and depressive symptoms and subjective function. Results: 63% of participants assigned to problem solving and 44% assigned to prevention of depression completed their intervention. The proportion of problem solving participants depressed at six months was 17% less than that for controls, giving a number needed to treat of 6; the mean difference in Beck depression inventory score was \u22122.63 (95% confidence interval \u22124.95 to \u22120.32), and there were significant improvements in SF-36 scores. For depression prevention, the difference in proportions of depressed participants was 14% (number needed to treat of 7); the mean difference in Beck depression inventory score was \u22121.50 (\u22124.16 to 1.17), and there were significant improvements in SF-36 scores. Such differences were not observed at 12 months. Neither specific diagnosis nor treatment with antidepressants affected outcome. Conclusions: When offered to adults with depressive disorders in the community, problem solving treatment was more acceptable than the course on prevention of depression. Both interventions reduced caseness and improved subjective function.\n\n2.

Multilingual Denoising Pre-training for Neural Machine Translation\nThis paper demonstrates that multilingual denoising pre-training produces significant performance gains across a wide variety of machine translation (MT) tasks. We present mBART\u2014a sequence-to-sequence denoising auto-encoder pre-trained on large-scale monolingual corpora in many languages using the BART objective (Lewis et al., 2019 ). mBART is the first method for pre-training a complete sequence-to-sequence model by denoising full texts in multiple languages, whereas previous approaches have focused only on the encoder, decoder, or reconstructing parts of the text. Pre-training a complete model allows it to be directly fine-tuned for supervised (both sentence-level and document-level) and unsupervised machine translation, with no task- specific modifications. We demonstrate that adding mBART initialization produces performance gains in all but the highest-resource settings, including up to 12 BLEU points for low resource MT and over 5 BLEU points for many document-level and unsupervised models. We also show that it enables transfer to language pairs with no bi-text or that were not in the pre-training corpus, and present extensive analysis of which factors contribute the most to effective pre-training. 1\n\n2. Big Bird: Transformers for Longer Sequences\nTransformers-based models, such as BERT, have been one of the most successful deep learning models for NLP. Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having $O(1)$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also propose novel applications to genomics data.\n\n3. BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension\nWe present BART, a denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence models. BART is trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture which, despite its simplicity, can be seen as generalizing BERT (due to the bidirectional encoder), GPT (with the left-to-right decoder), and other recent pretraining schemes. We evaluate a number of noising approaches, finding the best performance by both randomly shuffling the order of sentences and using a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token. BART is particularly effective when fine tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa on GLUE and SQuAD, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 3.5 ROUGE. BART also provides a 1.1 BLEU increase over a back-translation system for machine translation, with only target language pretraining. We also replicate other pretraining schemes within the BART framework, to understand their effect on end-task performance.\n\n4. GLIDE: Towards Photorealistic Image Generation and Editing with Text-Guided Diffusion Models\nDiffusion models have recently been shown to generate high-quality synthetic images, especially when paired with a guidance technique to trade off diversity for fidelity. We explore diffusion models for the problem of text-conditional image synthesis and compare two different guidance strategies: CLIP guidance and classifier-free guidance. We find that the latter is preferred by human evaluators for both photorealism and caption similarity, and often produces photorealistic samples. Samples from a 3.5 billion parameter text-conditional diffusion model using classifier-free guidance are favored by human evaluators to those from DALL-E, even when the latter uses expensive CLIP reranking. Additionally, we find that our models can be fine-tuned to perform image inpainting, enabling powerful text-driven image editing. We train a smaller model on a filtered dataset and release the code and weights at https://github.com/openai/glide-text2im.\n\n5. Switch Transformers: Scaling to Trillion Parameter Models with Simple and Efficient Sparsity\nIn deep learning, models typically reuse the same parameters for all inputs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models defy this and instead select di\ufb00erent parameters for each incoming example. The result is a sparsely-activated model\u2014with an outrageous number of parameters\u2014but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs, and training instability. We address these with the introduction of the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques mitigate the instabilities, and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the \ufb01rst time, with lower precision (b\ufb02oat16) formats. We design models based o\ufb00 T5-Base and T5-Large (Ra\ufb00el et al., 2019) to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the \u201cColossal Clean Crawled Corpus\u201d, and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model. 1 present in each. These benchmarks consist of tasks requiring sentiment analysis (SST-2), word sense disambiguation (WIC), sentence similarty (MRPC, STS-B, QQP), natural language inference (MNLI, QNLI, RTE, CB), question answering (MultiRC, RECORD, BoolQ), coreference resolution (WNLI, WSC) and sentence completion (COPA) and sentence acceptability (CoLA). The CNNDM (Hermann et al., 2015) and BBC XSum (Narayan et al., 2018) data sets are used to measure the ability to summarize articles. Question answering is probed with the SQuAD data set (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) and the ARC Reasoning Challenge (Clark et al., 2018). And as in Roberts et al. (2020), we evaluate the knowledge of our models by \ufb01ne-tuning on three closed-book question answering data sets: Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), Web Questions (Berant et al., 2013) and Trivia QA (Joshi et al., 2017). Closed-book refers to questions posed with no supplemental reference or context material. To gauge the model\u2019s common sense reasoning we evaluate it on the Winogrande Schema Challenge (Sakaguchi et al., 2020). And \ufb01nally, we test our model\u2019s natural language inference capabilities on the Adversarial NLI Benchmark (Nie et al., 2019). embeddings based on the incoming token representations to a given layer. Our work studies a speci\ufb01c model in a class of methods that do conditional computation, where computation decisions are made dynamically based on the input. Cho and Bengio (2014) proposed adaptively selecting weights based on certain bit patterns occuring in the model hidden-states. Eigen et al. (2013) built stacked expert layers with dense matrix multiplications and ReLU activations and showed promising results on jittered MNIST and monotone speech. In computer vision Puigcerver et al. (2020) manually route tokens based on semantic classes during upstream pre-training and then select the relevant experts to be used according to the downstream task.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of transformer models, recent methodologies have focused on enhancing model efficiency, scalability, and performance across various tasks. The BART model introduces a denoising auto-encoder pre-training approach, combining full attention with left-to-right decoder, and achieving significant gains in text generation and comprehension tasks (3). BigBird extends the transformer family by proposing a sparse attention mechanism, which reduces the quadratic sequence length dependency and enables handling of longer context, leading to improvements in sequence tasks like question answering and summarization (2). On the other hand, the Switch Transformers method embraces the Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach, simplifying the routing algorithm and achieving remarkable speed and memory improvements during pre-training, while maintaining or surpassing previous state-of-the-art results (5). Meanwhile, GLIDE leverages diffusion models for text-conditional image synthesis, employing classifier-free guidance strategies to enhance image fidelity and caption similarity, and demonstrating the model's capability for text-driven image editing (4). Lastly, the Integrated Language-Video Pre-training (ILVP) method combines language and video pre-training to improve multimodal understanding and enhance the performance of downstream tasks like video captioning and QA (7). Collectively, these methodologies contribute to the advancement of transformer models by enhancing their efficiency, scalability, and versatility across different domains.\n\n",

Multilingual Denoising Pre-training for Neural Machine Translation\nThis paper demonstrates that multilingual denoising pre-training produces significant performance gains across a wide variety of machine translation (MT) tasks. We present mBART\u2014a sequence-to-sequence denoising auto-encoder pre-trained on large-scale monolingual corpora in many languages using the BART objective (Lewis et al., 2019 ). mBART is the first method for pre-training a complete sequence-to-sequence model by denoising full texts in multiple languages, whereas previous approaches have focused only on the encoder, decoder, or reconstructing parts of the text. Pre-training a complete model allows it to be directly fine-tuned for supervised (both sentence-level and document-level) and unsupervised machine translation, with no task- specific modifications. We demonstrate that adding mBART initialization produces performance gains in all but the highest-resource settings, including up to 12 BLEU points for low resource MT and over 5 BLEU points for many document-level and unsupervised models. We also show that it enables transfer to language pairs with no bi-text or that were not in the pre-training corpus, and present extensive analysis of which factors contribute the most to effective pre-training. 1\n\n2.

It uses a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture which, despite its simplicity, can be seen as generalizing BERT (due to the bidirectional encoder), GPT (with the left-to-right decoder), and other recent pretraining schemes. We evaluate a number of noising approaches, finding the best performance by both randomly shuffling the order of sentences and using a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token. BART is particularly effective when fine tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa on GLUE and SQuAD, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 3.5 ROUGE. BART also provides a 1.1 BLEU increase over a back-translation system for machine translation, with only target language pretraining. We also replicate other pretraining schemes within the BART framework, to understand their effect on end-task performance.\n\n4. GLIDE: Towards Photorealistic Image Generation and Editing with Text-Guided Diffusion Models\nDiffusion models have recently been shown to generate high-quality synthetic images, especially when paired with a guidance technique to trade off diversity for fidelity. We explore diffusion models for the problem of text-conditional image synthesis and compare two different guidance strategies: CLIP guidance and classifier-free guidance. We find that the latter is preferred by human evaluators for both photorealism and caption similarity, and often produces photorealistic samples. Samples from a 3.5 billion parameter text-conditional diffusion model using classifier-free guidance are favored by human evaluators to those from DALL-E, even when the latter uses expensive CLIP reranking. Additionally, we find that our models can be fine-tuned to perform image inpainting, enabling powerful text-driven image editing. We train a smaller model on a filtered dataset and release the code and weights at https://github.com/openai/glide-text2im.\n\n5. Switch Transformers: Scaling to Trillion Parameter Models with Simple and Efficient Sparsity\nIn deep learning, models typically reuse the same parameters for all inputs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models defy this and instead select di\ufb00erent parameters for each incoming example. The result is a sparsely-activated model\u2014with an outrageous number of parameters\u2014but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs, and training instability. We address these with the introduction of the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques mitigate the instabilities, and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the \ufb01rst time, with lower precision (b\ufb02oat16) formats. We design models based o\ufb00 T5-Base and T5-Large (Ra\ufb00el et al., 2019) to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the \u201cColossal Clean Crawled Corpus\u201d, and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model. 1 present in each. These benchmarks consist of tasks requiring sentiment analysis (SST-2), word sense disambiguation (WIC), sentence similarty (MRPC, STS-B, QQP), natural language inference (MNLI, QNLI, RTE, CB), question answering (MultiRC, RECORD, BoolQ), coreference resolution (WNLI, WSC) and sentence completion (COPA) and sentence acceptability (CoLA). The CNNDM (Hermann et al., 2015) and BBC XSum (Narayan et al., 2018) data sets are used to measure the ability to summarize articles. Question answering is probed with the SQuAD data set (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) and the ARC Reasoning Challenge (Clark et al., 2018). And as in Roberts et al. (2020), we evaluate the knowledge of our models by \ufb01ne-tuning on three closed-book question answering data sets: Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), Web Questions (Berant et al., 2013) and Trivia QA (Joshi et al., 2017). Closed-book refers to questions posed with no supplemental reference or context material. To gauge the model\u2019s common sense reasoning we evaluate it on the Winogrande Schema Challenge (Sakaguchi et al., 2020). And \ufb01nally, we test our model\u2019s natural language inference capabilities on the Adversarial NLI Benchmark (Nie et al., 2019). embeddings based on the incoming token representations to a given layer. Our work studies a speci\ufb01c model in a class of methods that do conditional computation, where computation decisions are made dynamically based on the input. Cho and Bengio (2014) proposed adaptively selecting weights based on certain bit patterns occuring in the model hidden-states. Eigen et al. (2013) built stacked expert layers with dense matrix multiplications and ReLU activations and showed promising results on jittered MNIST and monotone speech. In computer vision Puigcerver et al. (2020) manually route tokens based on semantic classes during upstream pre-training and then select the relevant experts to be used according to the downstream task.\n\n###\n\n",
        "inference": " In the realm of natural language processing, the BART model introduces a novel approach to sequence-to-sequence pre-training, significantly enhancing performance across various NLP tasks. By corrupting text with a variety of noising functions and learning to reconstruct it, BART demonstrates superior results in text generation and comprehension tasks, outperforming existing models like RoBERTa and achieving state-of-the-art results in dialogue, question answering, and summarization (3). Meanwhile, the BigBird model tackles the limitations of traditional transformers by introducing a sparse attention mechanism, which can handle longer sequence lengths and improve performance on tasks such as question answering and summarization, while also being theoretically proven to be a universal approximator of sequence functions (2). The GLIDE model advances text-conditional image synthesis, employing a diffusion model with classifier-free guidance to achieve photorealistic image generation and text-driven image editing, surpassing the performance of the DALL-E model in human evaluations (4). Lastly, the Switch Transformers introduce a sparsely-activated model with reduced communication and computational costs, achieving up to 7x increases in pre-training speed and scalability to trillion-parameter models, while maintaining or improving performance on various NLP benchmarks (5). Each of these papers contributes to the broader effort of improving the efficiency and capabilities of machine learning models, particularly in the areas of language translation, text generation, and image synthesis.",
