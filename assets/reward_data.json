In this study, we compare the CO2 fluxes derived from atmospheric inversions and ocean biogeochemical models (OBGMs). We also examine the environmental controls on CO2 fluxes in specific regions of the Indian Ocean, such as the northeastern region and the Arabian Sea.\n\nMethods:\nWe used atmospheric CO2 data from the Global Monitoring Laboratory (GML) and oceanic pCO2 data from the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT). We applied two OBGMs, the MIT General Circulation Model (MITgcm) and the Carbon and Nutrient Bio-optical Modeling System (CNBMS), to estimate CO2 fluxes. We compared the model results with atmospheric inversions from the Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) and Ocean Fluxes from Satellite Algorithms (OFASA).\n\nResults:\nThe models and inversions capture the phase of the observed seasonality for the entire Indian Ocean but overestimate the magnitude. The predicted sea\u2013air CO2 fluxes by OBGMs respond to seasonal variability with strong phase lags, whereas atmospheric inversions predicted an order of magnitude higher seasonal flux than OBGMs. The simulated interannual variability by OBGMs is weaker than that found by atmospheric inversions. Prediction of such weak interannual variability in CO2 fluxes by atmospheric inversions was mainly caused by a lack of atmospheric data in the Indian Ocean.\n\nIn the northeastern region, North-south gradients in pCO2 levels were closely related to gradients in salinity caused by fresh water discharge received from rivers. Eddies observed in this region helped to elevate the nutrients availability and the biological controls by increasing the productivity. These phenomena elevated the carbon dioxide draw down during the fair seasons. Seasonal fluxes estimated from local wind speed and air-sea CO2 difference indicate that during southwest monsoon, the northeastern Indian Ocean acts as a strong sink of carbon dioxide (-20.04 mmol m-2 d-1). Also during fall intermonsoon the area acts as a weak source (3.6 Tg year<SUP>-1</SUP>), whereas both of these adjacent seas added nitrogen to the Arabian Sea.\n\nIn the Arabian Sea, by our model calculations the annual fluxes into and out were 446 and 530 trillion grams (Tg) for carbon, and 8.06 and 3.6 Tg for nitrogen, respectively. The carbon budget was found to be negatively balanced by 84 Tg year<SUP>-1</SUP>. A possible source to compensate for this deficit could be from the northward movement of Antarctic Bottom Water in the bottom layers, which are probably enriched with anthropogenic carbon dioxide. Annually, ~74 Tg of carbon in the form of CO2 escaped into the atmosphere from the Arabian Sea; this is higher than the global average fluxes from the tropical oceans. The percentage loss of carbon (14.0%) to the atmosphere was much lower than that of nitrogen (56.9%). Out of the total amount of denitrified nitrogen (29.5 Tg), only ~7% was lost to the atmosphere. This model suggests that ~6 Tg N year<SUP>-1</SUP> of denitrified nitrogen of the world's oceans could be liberated to the atmosphere through the surface layer of denitrified areas.\n\nConclusion:\nOur study highlights the importance of considering environmental controls and data-model comparisons in understanding the seasonal and spatial variability of CO2 fluxes in specific regions of the Indian Ocean. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the role of the Indian Ocean in global carbon sink and the implications for future climate change scenarios.",

Introduction\nThe Indian Ocean is a significant contributor to the global carbon cycle, accounting for about 20% of the total oceanic uptake of atmospheric CO2 (Sabine et al., 2004). Understanding the seasonal and spatial patterns of CO2 fluxes in the Indian Ocean is crucial for estimating the role of this region in global carbon budgets. In this study, we compare CO2 fluxes derived from observations and model simulations in the Indian Ocean. We use atmospheric CO2 data from the Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) network and ocean biogeochemical models to estimate CO2 fluxes.\n\n2. Data and Methods\n\n2.1. Observational Data\nWe used monthly mean atmospheric CO2 data from the GAW network for the Indian Ocean region (50\u00b0S-50\u00b0N, 20\u00b0E-140\u00b0E). We also used seaweaver (Hwang et al., 2017) to calculate monthly mean oceanic CO2 data based on Sabine et al. (2004) model.\n\n2.1. Model Simulations\nWe used two ocean biogechemical models: Indian Ocean Ocean Model (IOOM) and Pacific Ocean Ocean Model (POOM). Both models were forced with monthly mean atmospheric CO2 data from the GAW network, and monthly mean oceanic CO2 data based on Sabine et al. (2004) model.\n\n3. Results: Seasonal and Spatial Patterns of CO2 Fluxes in the Indian Ocean\n\n3.1. Comparison between Observations and Model Simulations\nOur results show that both observational and modeling approaches capture the phase of observed seasonality for the entire Indian Ocean but overestimate the magnitude. The differences are mainly driven by:\n\n* Lack of atmospheric CO2 data in atmospheric inversions\n* Poor simulation of monsoonal currents and freshwater discharge in ocean biogehemical models\n\n3.1. Arabian Sea during Southwest Monsoon\nThe Arabian Sea is a significant source of atmospheric CO2 during southwest monsoon. Our findings suggest that:\n\n* The annual fluxes into and out of the Arabian Sea were estimated to be 446 and 530 Tg for carbon, respectively.\n* A possible source to compensate for the deficit could be from the northward movement of Antarctic Bottom Water in the bottom layers, which are probably enriched with anthropogenic CO2.\n* Annually, ~74 Tg of carbon in the form of CO2 escaped into the atmosphere from the Arabian Sea; this is higher than the global average fluxes from tropical oceans.\n\n3.1. Northeastern Indian Ocean\nThe northeastern Indian Ocean acts as a strong sink during the fair seasons. Our findings suggest that:\n\n* The annual fluxes into and out of the northeastern Indian Ocean were estimated to be 446 and 3.6 Tg for nitrogen, respectively.\n* A possible source to compensate for the deficit could be from the northward movement of Antarctic Bottom Water in the bottom layers, which are probably enriched with anthropogenic CO2.\n* The percentage loss of carbon (14.0%) to the atmosphere was much lower than that of nitrogen (56.9%).\n\n3.1. Carbon and Nitrogen Budgets for the Indian Ocean\nOur findings suggest that:\n\n* The annual fluxes into and out of the entire Indian Ocean were estimated to be 446 and 8.06 Tg for carbon, respectively.\n* A possible source to compensate for the deficit could be from the northward movement of Antarctic Bottom Water in the bottom layers, which are probably enriched with anthropogenic CO2.\n* The annual fluxes into and out of the Arabian Sea were estimated to be 446 and 3.6 Tg for nitrogen, respectively.\n* The Arabian Sea was found to be a carbon source for the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, whereas both of these adjacent seas added nitrogen to the Arabian Sea.\n* Based on standing crops and net outflows, estimated residence times were ~944 and 4.04 \u00d710<sup>4</sup> years for carbon and nitrogen, respectively, in the Indian Ocean.\n\n4. Discussion: Implications of CO2 Fluxes in the Indian Ocean for Global Carbon and Nitrogen Cycles\nOur findings suggest that:\n\n* The annual fluxes into and out of the entire Indian Ocean were estimated to be 446 and 8.06 Tg for carbon, respectively.\n* A possible source to compensate for the deficit could be from the northward movement of Antarctic Bottom Water in the bottom layers, which are probably enriched with anthropogenic CO2.\n* The annual fluxes into and out of the Arabian Sea were estimated to be 446 and 3.6 Tg for nitrogen, respectively.\n* The Arabian Sea was found to be a carbon source for the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, whereas both of these adjacent seas added nitrogen to the Arabian Sea.\n* Our findings suggest that ~6 Tg N year<sup>-1</SUP> of denitrified nitrogen from the world's oceans could be liberated to the atmosphere through the surface layer of denitrified areas.\n\n5.

Here we present new data on N2 fixation, nitrification rates, and diazotroph and nitrifier community structure across the Pacific front (PF), the tropical front (STF), and the Pacific equatorial divergence (PED). We measured N2 fixation and nitrification rates and quantified the relative abundances of diazotrophs and nitrifiers in a region where few to no rate measurements are available. Even though N2 fixation rates are usually below detection limits in cold environments, we were able to measure this N pathway at 7/10 stations in the cold and nutrient rich waters near the PF. This result highlights that N2 fixation rates continue to be measured outside the well-known subtropical regions. The majority of the mid to high N2 fixation rates (>\u223c20 nmol L\u20131 d\u20131), however, still occurred in the expected tropical and subtropical regions. High throughput sequence analyses of the dinitrogenase reductase gene (nifH) revealed that the nifH Cluster I dominated the diazotroph diversity throughout the transect. nifH gene richness did not show a latitudinal trend, nor was it significantly correlated with N2 fixation rates. Nitrification rates above the mixed layer in the Southern Ocean ranged between 56 and 1440 nmol L\u20131 d\u20131. Our data showed a decoupling between carbon and N assimilation (NO3\u2013 and NH4+ assimilation rates) in winter in the South Pacific Ocean. Phytoplankton community structure showed clear changes across the PF, the STF and the PED, defining clear biomes. Overall, these findings provide a better understanding of the ecosystem functionality in the South Pacific Ocean across key oceanographic biomes.\n\nKeywords: Nitrogen cycling, Diazotrophs, Nitrification, South Pacific Ocean, Oceanography, Biogeochemistry.\n\nIntroduction:\nThe South Pacific Ocean (SPO) is a vast and complex marine ecosystem that plays an essential role in global biogeochemical cycles. The SPO exhibits distinct oceanographic features, including the Pacific front (PF), the tropical front (STF), and the Pacific equatorial divergence (PED). These features influence nutrient availability, primary productivity, and N cycling processes such as nitrogen fixation and denitrification [1]. Understanding the distribution and functioning of these processes is crucial for predicting future changes in marine ecosystems under a changing climate.\n\nNitrogen fixation is an essential process that provides new sources of fixed nitrogen to support primary productivity in oligotrophic marine environments [2]. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria, or diazotrophs, are responsible for this process and can be classified into two main groups: autotrophic (cyanobacteria) and heterotrophic. Autotrophic diazotrophs perform photosynthesis to generate energy, while heterotrophic diazotrophs rely on external organic matter for energy [3]. The contribution of heterotrophic diazotrophs to overall N2 fixation activity is currently unclear, especially in the context of changing ocean conditions and increasing inputs of dissolved organic matter (DOM) [4].\n\nNitrification is another essential process that converts ammonium (NH4+) into nitrate (NO3\u2013), making it available for primary producers. Nitrification is carried out by two groups of bacteria: ammonia oxidizers (ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, AOB, and archaea, AOA) and nitrite oxidizers (nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, NOB) [5]. Understanding the distribution and functioning of these processes is crucial for predicting future changes in marine ecosystems under a changing climate.\n\nMethods:\nTo investigate N cycling and diazotroph community structure across key oceanographic biomes in the South Pacific Ocean, we conducted a research cruise from 15th to 28th October 2019 onboard the R/V Falkor. We collected water samples at 10 stations (3-6\u00b0S, 147-151\u00b0W) across the PF, STF, and PED (Figure 1).\n\nWater samples were collected using a Niskin rosette system with a 20 L GoFlow bottle attached. Samples were taken at depths of 3 m (surface layer), 15-20 m (subsurface layer), and 40-60 m (deep layer). Temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen measurements were made using a CTD rosette system.\n\nNitrogen fixation rates were determined by the acetylene inhibition method [6]. Briefly, water samples were incubated with 15% acetylene for 30 minutes to inhibit nitrogenase activity. Subsequently, the reduction of nitrate to ammonium was measured using a modified Cheyne-Stansbury method [7].\n\nNitrification rates were determined by the change in dissolved oxygen concentration over time [8]. Briefly, water samples were incubated in the dark for 24 hours. The reduction of nitrate to ammonium was measured using a modified Cheyne-Stansbury method [7].\n\nDiazotroph and nitrifier community structure was investigated by high-throughput sequencing of the dinitrogenase reductase gene (nifH) [9]. Briefly, water samples were collected in 50 mL Niskin bottles. The seawater was filtered through a 0.2 \u00b5m pore size sterilized filter to remove larger organisms and planktonic diatoms. The filtrate was frozen at -80\u00b0C until further processing.\n\nTotal RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Plus Kit [10]. cDNA synthesis was performed using the SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers [11]. The nifH gene was amplified using primers NifH_Fw and Nifh_Rev [12].\n\nThe amplicon library was prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II kit [13] and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequencing data were processed using QIIME [14], including quality filtering, denoising, and chimera removal.\n\nResults:\nNitrogen fixation rates ranged from 0 to >20 nmol L-1 d-1 (Figure 2). The highest N2 fixation rates were observed in the nutrient-rich waters near the PF. These results highlight that N2 fixation continues to be measured outside the well-known subtropical regions.\n\nNitrification rates ranged from 56 to 1440 nmol L-1 d-1 (Figure 3). The highest nitrification rates were observed in the nutrient-poor waters near the PED. Our data showed a decoupling between carbon and N assimilation (NO3\u2013 and NH4+ assimilation rates) in winter in the South Pacific Ocean (Figure 4).\n\nHigh-throughput sequencing of nifH revealed that Cluster I dominated the diazotroph diversity throughout the transect (Figure 5). The nifH gene richness did not show a latitudinal trend, nor was it significantly correlated with N2 fixation rates.\n\nDiscussion:\nOur new data on N cycling and diazotroph and nitrifier community structure across key oceanographic biomes in the South Pacific Ocean provide valuable insights into the functioning of these processes in this complex marine ecosystem. The distribution and functioning of N cycling processes are crucial for predicting future changes in marine ecosystems under a changing climate.\n\nThe highest N2 fixation rates were observed in the nutrient-rich waters near the PF, highlighting that N2 fixation continues to be measured outside the well-known subtropical regions.

The SPO exhibits distinct oceanographic features, including the Pacific equatorial divergence (PF), the subtropical front (STF), and the Pacific eddy (PED). These biomes are characterized by different physical and chemical properties, which in turn influence nutrient availability and primary productivity. Nitrogen fixation is a key process that sustains productivity in oligotrophic marine ecosystems, yet our understanding of this process in the SPO remains limited due to the lack of rate measurements and molecular data. Here we present new data on N2 fixation and nitrification rates, as well as diazotroph and nitrifier community structure across the PF, the STF, and the PED in the SPO.\n\nMethods:\nSamples were collected during a research cruise aboard the R/V Falkor in March 2019. N2 fixation rates were measured using the acetylene reduction assay (ARA) and nitrification rates were determined using the isotope dilution method. The ARA was performed on discrete water samples collected from the euphotic zone, while nitrification rates were measured in incubated bottles above the mixed layer. Additionally, we quantified the relative abundances of diazotrophs and nitrifiers using high-throughput sequencing of the dinitrogenase reductase gene (nifH).\n\nResults:\nTotal N2 fixation rates ranged from 0 to 13.5 nmol N L\u20131 d\u20131, with the highest rates occurring in the tropical and subtropical regions. The addition of the photosynthesis inhibitor 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) reduced N2 fixation by >90%, suggesting that autotrophic diazotrophs dominated overall N2 fixation activity. High throughput sequence analyses of the nifH gene revealed that the nifH Cluster I dominated the diazotroph diversity throughout the transect, with no significant correlation between nifH gene richness and N2 fixation rates. Nitrification rates above the mixed layer ranged from 56 to 1440 nmol L\u20131 d\u20131, with highest rates occurring in the tropical and subtropical regions. Our data showed a decoupling between carbon and N assimilation (NO3- and NH4+ assimilation rates) in winter in the South Pacific Ocean. Phytoplankton community structure showed clear changes across the PF, the STF, and the PED, defining distinct biomes.\n\nDiscussion:\nOur results highlight the importance of understanding N cycling mechanisms in the context of changing oceanographic conditions. The lack of rate measurements and molecular data has limited our ability to understand the underlying processes that sustain productivity in oligotrophic marine ecosystems. Our findings provide new insights into the role of autotrophic diazotrophs in N2 fixation, as well as the importance of nitrification in maintaining nutrient availability and primary productivity.\n\nConclusions:\nOur results demonstrate the importance of understanding N cycling mechanisms in the context of changing oceanographic conditions.

The relationship between dinitrogen fixation and primary production, as well as the specific types of diazotrophs involved, remains poorly understood (1). Several studies have investigated nitrogen fixation rates and diazotroph community structure across different regions of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn the equatorial Pacific, nitrogen fixation rates varied significantly along a trophic gradient, with higher rates observed in coastal waters due to the presence of Trichodesmium spp. (2). In contrast, unicellular diazotrophs dominated in nutrient-poor waters and reached extremely high rates near Papua New Guinea (2). However, there is a possibility of overestimation of nitrogen fixation rates due to the presence of unicellular diazotrophs associated with mucilage, particles, or eukaryotes in larger size fractions (2).\n\nIn the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean, dinitrogen fixation was detected both in euphotic and aphotic waters, with rates reaching up to 509 \u00b5mol N m\u22122 d\u22121 in the surface layers and 118\u00b187 \u00b5mol N m\u22122 d\u22121 in the deep waters (4). Non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs affiliated with nifH clusters 1K, 1G, and 3 were identified in the deep waters of the Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) (4). Organic nutrients, particularly amino acids and simple carbohydrates, significantly stimulated nitrogen fixation in the core of the OMZ (4).\n\nIn the Western Tropical South Pacific Ocean, extremely high dinitrogen fixation rates were observed at two stations dominated by Trichodesmium, contributing to over 90% of new N inputs before atmospheric deposition and upward nitrate fluxes (5). At another station characterized by ultra-oligotrophic waters, lower nitrogen fixation rates and a different diazotroph community were detected (5).\n\nThese studies suggest that the community composition of diazotrophs in the field significantly influences how much nitrogen becomes available to the wider phytoplankton community and how much autotrophic diazotrophs themselves fix carbon, thereby impacting local primary production.

However, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the intracellular delivery of drugs limit their efficacy. In this study, we developed novel self-assembled polymersomes functionalized with lactoferrin (Lf) or transferrin (Tf) for neuroprotection and cancer therapy.\n\nFirstly, we prepared biodegradable polymersomes loaded with doxorubicin (DOX), PO-DOX, and then conjugated them with Tf to yield Tf-PO-DOX. The results showed that Tf-PO-DOX had a stronger cytotoxicity against C6 glioma cells and greater intracellular delivery than PO-DOX and free DOX. Pharmacokinetic and brain distribution experiments demonstrated that Tf-PO significantly enhanced the brain delivery of DOX, especially to tumor cells. The results showed a significant reduction in tumor volume and an increase in median survival time for rats treated with Tf-PO-DOX compared to saline control, PO-DOX, and free DOX solution.\n\nSecondly, we prepared polymersomes with self-assembled bilayers, Lf-POS, and investigated their proton permeability. The results showed that the apparent diffusion coefficient (D*) of H(+) through the polymersome membrane was 5.659 \u00d7 10(-26) cm(2) s(-1), while that of liposomes was 1.017 \u00d7 10(-24) cm(2) s(-1). The stability of the polymersome membrane was much higher than that of liposomes. Fluorescence imaging showed that Lf-POS was effectively transferred into the brain, and the optimal density of lactoferrin was 101 molecules per polymersome. Pharmacokinetics revealed that Lf-POS obtained the greatest BBB permeability surface area and %ID per g compared with transferrin-modified polymersomes and cationic bovine serum albumin-modified polymersomes. Furthermore, Lf-POS holding S14G-humanin protected against learning and memory impairment induced by amyloid-\u03b225-35 in rats. Western blotting revealed that the nanomedicine provided neuroprotection against over-expression of apoptotic proteins exhibiting neurofibrillary tangle pathology in neurons.\n\nThe results indicated that polymersomes can be exploited as a promising non-invasive nanomedicine capable of mediating peptide therapeutic delivery and controlling the release of drugs to the central nervous system, while PO-DOX showed potential for cancer therapy by enhancing the intracellular delivery and cytotoxicity of DOX against glioma cells.",

Introduction\nThe importance of dietary diversity in ensuring adequate nutrient intake and overall health has been well established (FAO et al., 2013). However, the role of production diversity and market access in shaping household dietary patterns varies across contexts (Bouis & Haddad, 2003; Fanzo et al., 2017). In rural areas of low-income settings, where agriculture is a primary source of livelihood, understanding the relationship between production diversity, market access, and dietary diversity is crucial for designing effective interventions to improve food security and nutrition (Bouis & Haddad, 2003; Fanzo et al., 2017).\n\nIn India, where agriculture plays a significant role in the economy and provides livelihoods for over half of the population (World Bank, 2020), there is limited evidence on the relationship between production diversity, market access, and dietary diversity. This study aims to fill this gap by analyzing data from an extensive agriculture-nutrition survey conducted in rural India in 2017.\n\n2. Methods\nData for this study were collected through a comprehensive agriculture-nutrition survey of 3600 households across 150 villages in six Indian states (Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and Uttar Pradesh). The survey used a multi-stage sampling design to ensure representativeness at the village level. Dietary diversity scores were constructed for women and households based on 24-hour and 7-day recall periods using the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) dietary diversity score methodology (FAO et al., 2013). Household market integration was measured as monthly household expenditure on key non-staple food groups, while production diversity was assessed at both the field level (number of crops or food groups grown) and on-farm level (livestock management, kitchen gardens).\n\nIndividual- and household-level regression models were developed and estimated using Stata 15.0 software. The analysis controlled for village, household, and individual-level covariates and included village fixed effects to account for unobserved heterogeneity.\n\n3. Results\nDescriptive statistics showed that the mean dietary diversity score for women was 2.9 (standard deviation = 1.4), while the mean household dietary diversity score was 3.5 (standard deviation = 1.2). The mean monthly household expenditure on non-staple food groups was INR 1,086 (standard deviation = 719). The average number of crops or food groups grown per household was 4.5 (standard deviation = 1.3), and the percentage of households with livestock was 62%.\n\nRegression results showed that on-farm production diversity was positively associated with dietary diversity for both women and households (Table 1). Household market integration also contributed to improved dietary diversity, while field-level production diversity had no significant effect. Other determinants of dietary diversity included women's literacy, household wealth, and awareness of nutrition.\n\nTable 1: Determinants of Dietary Diversity among Rural Indian Households (N = 3600)\n\n| Variable | Coefficient (SE) | p-value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| On-farm production diversity | 0.25 (0.04) | < 0.001 |\n| Household market integration | 0.03 (0.01) | 0.016 |\n| Field-level production diversity | -0.01 (0.02) | 0.587 |\n| Women's literacy | 0.14 (0.03) | < 0.001 |\n| Household wealth | 0.06 (0.02) | 0.009 |\n| Awareness of nutrition | 0.18 (0.05) | < 0.001 |\n| Constant | -3.47 (1.12) | < 0.001 |\n\n4. Discussion\nThe findings from this study suggest that on-farm production diversity and household market integration are important determinants of dietary diversity among rural Indian households. These results are consistent with previous studies conducted in other low-income settings (Bouis & Haddad, 2003; Fanzo et al., 2017).\n\nThe positive association between on-farm production diversity and dietary diversity highlights the importance of diversifying agricultural production to improve household food security and nutrition. However, the small effect size of this relationship suggests that further increasing production diversity may not be the most effective strategy to improve diets in smallholder farm households. Instead, efforts should focus on improving access to markets, productivity-enhancing inputs and technologies, and increasing awareness of the importance of a diverse diet for overall health.\n\n5. Conclusion\nThis study provides new evidence on the relationship between production diversity, market access, and dietary diversity among rural Indian households using individual-level 24-hour recall data. The findings suggest that on-farm production diversity and household market integration are important determinants of dietary diversity, while field-level production diversity had no significant effect. Improving access to markets, productivity-enhancing inputs and technologies, and increasing awareness of the importance of a diverse diet for overall health seem to be more promising strategies for improving diets in smallholder farm households in India.\n\nReferences:\nBouis, H.

They find that X-rays dominate the heating unless Ly\u03b1 photons significantly enhance from stars in low-mass objects (1, 2). The third methodology uses observations of the Chandra Deep Field South to study the ionization state of the IGM by quasars (5). It finds that the average HII region is mainly set by UV flux, but a largely neutral and warm tail extends beyond the ionization front due to X-ray flux. The fourth methodology analyzes the Chandra data on the diffuse X-ray background to estimate its extragalactic component (4).

Both groups exhibit similar temperatures to the kinetic motions of their galaxies, suggesting that the potential wells of these groups contain the gas.\n\nThe second paper focuses on the instrumental background modeling in Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of the dark Moon (2). The results indicate that the dark Moon does not emit significantly in the observed band and that point sources contribute less than 80% of the total CXB flux in this band. The diffuse emission is dominated by a kT = 0.1-0.4 keV plasma, with prominent line blends at different energies depending on the field location.\n\nThe third paper investigates the impact of quasars on the ionization of the surrounding intergalactic medium using radiative transfer simulations (5). The findings suggest that the average HII region is primarily set by UV flux, while a largely neutral and warm tail extends up to several Mpc beyond the ionization front due to X-ray flux. However, the assumed DLA clustering and gas opacity indicate that either the ionization rate of the quasar is lower than expected or the observed bright phase of ULAS J1120+0641 is shorter than 10^7 yrs.\n\nThe fourth paper focuses on the contribution of extragalactic diffuse emission in Chandra X-ray Observatory observations (3). The results show that the diffuse signal varies strongly from field to field and contributes between 55% and 90% of the total CXB signal in the 0.3-1 keV band. The dominant line blends are modeled by a kT = 0.1-0.4 keV plasma, with different energies depending on the field location.\n\nThe fifth paper reports the detection of X-ray emission from a galaxy cluster using Suzaku and Chandra observations (4). The findings suggest that the central galaxy in the cluster is an active galactic nucleus (AGN) contributing significantly to the X-ray emission, while the intracluster medium exhibits a complex temperature structure with multiple components. The results also indicate that the AGN contributes to the heating of the intracluster medium and that the gas density profile is consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium.",

Introduction\nOrganic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted significant attention due to their potential for low cost, flexibility, and lightweight applications [1]. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs has been rapidly increasing over the past decade, reaching a record value of 13.6% in single-junction devices [2] and 20.4% in tandem devices [3]. However, most high-performance OSCs are based on fullerene acceptors, which have narrow optical absorption spectra that limit the utilization of sunlight [4]. To overcome this limitation, researchers have been focusing on designing new electron acceptors with extended conjugation, strong near-infrared (NIR) absorption, and low energy loss.\n\n2. Design and Synthesis of Indenoindene-Based Electron Acceptors\nIndenoindene is a carbon-bridged E-stilbene with a centrosymmetric molecular framework, which shows elongated \u03c0-conjugation with 14 \u03c0-electrons and one more sp3 carbon bridge compared to fluorene, a carbon-bridged biphenylene with an axial symmetry [5]. This may increase the tunability of electronic structure and film morphology. We recently designed and synthesized a new thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-based small-molecule electron acceptor, 2,2\u2032-(1,1\u2032-bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))bis(methanylylidene)bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene) (IH), which exhibits strong NIR absorption with extinction coefficients of up to 1.6 \u00d7 10^5 M^\u22121 cm^\u22121 [6]. The application of IH in OSCs results in PCEs up to 12.74%, among the best performance reported for fullerene-free organic photovoltaics (OPV) [7].\n\n3. Design and Synthesis of Fused-Ring Electron Acceptors\nFused-ring electron acceptors with strong electron-donating groups and extended conjugation have shown ultra-narrow optical bandgaps as low as 1.21 eV [8] and high PCEs up to 11.2% for as-cast OSCs [9]. We recently designed, synthesized, and applied a new series of indenoindene-based electron acceptors with elongated \u03c0-conjugation and a centrosymmetric molecular framework. These acceptors exhibit narrow optical bandgaps and high molar extinction coefficients. The application of these acceptors in OSCs results in PCEs up to 12.74%, among the best performance reported for fullerene-free OPV [7].\n\n4. Design and Synthesis of Twisted Thieno[3,4-b]Thiophene-Based Electron Acceptors\nWe recently designed, synthesized, and applied a new twisted thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-based electron acceptor with a 14-\u03c0-electron indenoindene core for high-performance OSCs [10]. This acceptor exhibits strong NIR absorption with extinction coefficients of up to 1.6 \u00d7 10^5 M^\u22121 cm^\u22121, a narrow optical bandgap of 1.38 eV, and a high electron mobility of 2.4 \u00d7 10^\u22123 cm^2 V^\u22121 s^\u22121 [11]. The ST-OSCs based on blends of a narrow-bandgap polymer donor PTB7-Th and narrow-bandgap IH acceptor exhibit a champion PCE of 9.77%, much higher than any single-junction and tandem ST-OSCs reported in the literature [12].\n\n5. Conclusion\nIn this review, we discuss recent progress in designing and synthesizing new electron acceptors with extended conjugation, strong NIR absorption, and low energy loss for high-performance OSCs. We first introduce a series of indenoindene-based acceptors with elongated \u03c0-conjugation and a centrosymmetric molecular framework, which exhibit narrow optical bandgaps and high molar extinction coefficients.

In this review, we discuss the design, synthesis, and application of new electron acceptors with extended conjugation, strong near-infrared absorption, and low energy loss for high-performance OSCs. We first introduce a series of fused thiophene-based nonfullerene acceptors (FTAZ: IHIC2 and FTAZ: IOIC2) with extended conjugation in the electron-donating fused-ring units, which yield PCEs up to 11.2% and 12.3%, respectively. We then describe a dithienopicenocarbazole-based acceptor (DTPC-DFIC) with an ultra-narrow bandgap of 1.21 eV and an extremely low energy loss of 0.45 eV in OSCs. Furthermore, we discuss a twisted thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-based acceptor (NITI) with a 14-\u03c0-electron indenoindene core, which shows an extremely low energy loss of 0.45 eV and a high PCE of 12.74%. Lastly, we introduce a fused hexacyclic electron acceptor (IHIC) with strong near-infrared absorption and a narrow optical bandgap of 1.38 eV, which is applied in semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs) to achieve a champion PCE of 9.77% with an average visible transmittance of 36%. These new electron acceptors expand the design space for high-performance OSCs and provide valuable insights into the development of next-generation fullerene-free organic photovoltaics.\n\nKeywords: Organic solar cells, Fullerene-free acceptors, Extended conjugation, Low energy loss, Near-infrared absorption.",

Understanding uncertainty in sea level projections: A case study of thermal expansion and ice sheet contributions\nSea level rise (SLR) is a major challenge for coastal communities worldwide. Projections of future SLR are essential to guide adaptation measures and assess mitigation options. However, the uncertainty in SLR projections is large due to the complex nature of the contributing processes. Here we investigate the uncertainty in SLR projections from two process-based models by analyzing their correlation structure and its time dependence. We find that assuming independence between contributors underestimates the total uncertainty in SLR projections, particularly for high-end low probability events. Our results highlight the importance of considering the correlation between uncertainties when assessing future SLR.\n2. Sea level rise and socioeconomic indicators under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways\nTo understand the societal impacts of sea level rise, it is crucial to study climate change pathways in conjunction with different scenarios of socioeconomic development. In this study, we present sea level rise projections for the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) storylines and various year-2100 radiative forcing targets (FTs). Our results show that median 2100 SLR relative to 1986\u20132005 ranges from 57 cm to 189 cm across different SSP scenarios. The FTs have a significant impact on the sea level response, with median estimates of 34 cm to 132 cm for FT 2.6 Wm\u22122 and the baseline scenarios, respectively. We also explore the link between scenario-specific emission and socioeconomic indicators and projected SLR.\n3. Future sea level rise constrained by observations and long-term commitment\nAnthropogenic sea level rise poses significant challenges to coastal areas worldwide, and robust projections are needed to assess mitigation options and guide adaptation measures. In this study, we present an approach that combines information about the equilibrium sea level response to global warming with observed contributions from individual components to constrain projections for this century. Our \u201cconstrained extrapolation\u201d method accounts for long-term changes in the partitioning of total sea level rise and yields SLR projections that overlap with process-based estimates from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Introduction\nSea level rise (SLR) is a significant challenge for coastal communities worldwide, with potential consequences ranging from increased storm surges and flooding to saltwater intrusion into freshwater resources [1]. Robust projections of future SLR are essential for informing mitigation options and adaptation measures [2]. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) provides a comprehensive assessment of future SLR based on process-based models, which account for the physical mechanisms driving sea level change [3]. However, these projections are subject to uncertainties due to the complex nature of the processes involved and the socioeconomic factors that influence greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nTo address this challenge, we present an integrated approach that combines SLR projections under different socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) and radiative forcing targets (FTs) with the assessment of their societal impacts. We employ a comprehensive SLR emulator accounting for Antarctic rapid discharge from hydrofracturing and ice cliff instability [4]. Our methodology, which we term \"constrained extrapolation,\" combines information about the equilibrium sea level response to global warming with observed contributions from individual components.\n\n2. Methodology\n\n2.1. Sea Level Rise Projections under SSPs and FTs\nWe use a comprehensive SLR emulator that accounts for Antarctic rapid discharge from hydrofracturing and ice cliff instability [4]. The model is based on the following components: (i) thermal expansion, (ii) glacier and ice cap melt, (iii) Greenland ice sheet mass balance, (iv) West Antarctic ice sheet mass balance, and (v) East Antarctic ice sheet mass balance. We employ a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) approach to generate 10,000 realizations of future SLR under each SSP-FT scenario combination [5].\n\n2.2. Constrained Extrapolation\nOur methodology combines information about the equilibrium sea level response to global warming with observed contributions from individual components. We use the historical record of global mean sea level rise (GMSLR) and its decomposition into component contributions [6] to constrain future projections. The approach is based on the following assumptions:\n\n1. The contribution of each component to GMSLR is a linear function of global mean temperature anomaly (\u0394T).\n2. The equilibrium response of SLR to \u0394T is given by the IPCC AR5 process-based models [3].\n3. The uncertainty in future SLR arises from the uncertainty in \u0394T and the uncertainty in the contribution of each component to GMSLR.\n\nWe employ a Bayesian regression model to estimate the linear relationship between each component's contribution to GMSLR and \u0394T [7]. We then use this relationship to generate future realizations of component contributions under each SSP-FT scenario combination. Finally, we combine these realizations to obtain future SLR projections under each SSP-FT scenario combination.\n\n3. Results and Discussion\n\n3.1. Sea Level Rise Projections under SSPs and FTs\nOur results show median 2100 SLR relative to 1986\u20132005 ranging from 57 cm (SSP1) to 189 cm (SSP5) across all baseline scenario realizations. The mitigation targets dominate combined SSP-FT scenarios, with median 2100 SLR ranging from 43 cm (SSP1-1\u00b0C FT) to 167 cm (SSP5-4.5\u00b0C FT).\n\n3.2. Societal Impacts of Future Sea Level Rise\nTo assess the societal impacts of future SLR, we employ a multi-sector integrated assessment framework [8]. We find that limiting median 2100 SLR to around 50 cm requires cumulative CO2 emissions below 850 GtC by 2050 and a nearly completed global coal phase-out.\n\n3.3. Comparison of Process-Based and Global Semiempirical Approaches\nOur methodology, which we term \"constrained extrapolation,\" can lead to a better understanding of the gap between process-based and global semiempirical approaches. The approach combines information about the equilibrium sea level response to global warming with observed contributions from individual components.\n\n4. Conclusions and Future Work\nOur integrated approach provides robust projections of future SLR under different SSPs and FTs, along with an assessment of their societal impacts. We find that limiting median 2100 SLR to around 50 cm requires cumulative CO2 emissions below 850 GtC by 2050 and a nearly completed global coal phase-out. Our methodology, which we term \"constrained extrapolation,\" can lead to a better understanding of the gap between process-based and global semiempirical approaches.\n\nFuture work includes extending this approach to other climate-related variables, such as precipitation or extreme events, and exploring its potential applications in climate policy design and adaptation planning.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Jevon M.

Given the multiple adaptation steps required, an adaptation pathways approach has merits for coastal areas. This article discusses the long-term SLR implications of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and presents a novel Adjusting Mitigation Pathway (AMP) approach to stabilize climate at these targets, generating scenarios up to year 2300 for surface warming, carbon emissions, atmospheric CO2, global mean sea level, and surface ocean acidification. We find that lower 21st century warming targets will significantly reduce ocean acidification this century and avoid up to 4 m of sea-level rise by year 2300 relative to a high-end scenario. Our results provide guidance for coastal city planners and policymakers in adapting to SLR under climate stabilization scenarios.\n\nKeywords: Sea-level rise, Climate stabilization, Adaptation pathways, Paris Agreement, Coastal cities\n\n1. Introduction\nSea-level rise (SLR) is a critical and uncertain climate change risk, with significant consequences for coastal cities worldwide(1). The Paris Agreement aims to limit global warming to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, preferably to 1.5\u00b0C(2), to avoid the most dangerous consequences of anthropogenic climate change. However, it is unclear what carbon emissions pathways will achieve these temperature targets and their associated SLR implications for coastal cities. This study discusses the long-term SLR implications of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels using a novel Adjusting Mitigation Pathway (AMP) approach, generating scenarios up to year 2300 for surface warming, carbon emissions, atmospheric CO2, global mean sea level, and surface ocean acidification.\n\n2. Long-term Sea-Level Rise Implications of 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C Warming Levels\nWe use a semi-empirical model(3) to estimate the SLR implications of holding warming below 2\u00b0C or 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial temperature, as mentioned in the Cancun Agreements(4). Limiting warming to these levels with a probability larger than 50% produces 75-80 cm SLR above the year 2000 by 2100. This is 25 cm below a scenario with unmitigated emissions, but 15 cm above a hypothetical scenario reducing global emissions to zero by 2016. The long-term SLR implications of the two warming goals diverge substantially on a multi-century timescale due to inertia in the climate system and differences in rates of SLR by 2100 between the scenarios. By 2300, a 1.5\u00b0C scenario could peak sea level at a median estimate of 1.5 m above 2000. The 50% probability scenario for 2\u00b0C warming would see sea level reaching 2.7 m above 2000 and still rising at about double the present-day rate. Halting SLR within a few centuries is likely to be achieved only with large-scale deployment of CO2 removal efforts, such as carbon capture and storage(5) or negative emissions technologies(6).\n\n3. Adapting to Sea-Level Rise in Coastal Cities under Climate Stabilization: A Pathways Approach\n\na) Long-term adaptation strategies\nLong-term adaptation strategies include relocating populations, building sea walls and other infrastructure, and implementing policies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions(7). Adapting to SLR under climate stabilization scenarios requires a pathways approach. This involves:\n\ni) Identifying the most vulnerable coastal cities based on population size, economic importance, and exposure to rising seas(8).\nii) Developing adaptation strategies tailored to each city's unique characteristics, such as building flood-resistant infrastructure, implementing early warning systems, and creating public education campaigns(9).\niii) Creating a framework for coordinating international cooperation on coastal city adaptation, including sharing best practices, providing financial assistance, and establishing a global network of experts(10).\n\nb) Short-term adaptation strategies\nShort-term adaptation strategies include implementing early warning systems, creating public education campaigns, and building flood-resistant infrastructure(11). These strategies can be implemented immediately to reduce the risks associated with rising seas.\n\nc) Monitoring progress and evaluating success\nMonitoring progress and evaluating success of coastal city adaptation strategies under climate stabilization scenarios requires:\n\ni) Establishing a global network of experts to assess the implementation of adaptation strategies(12).\nii) Developing indicators for measuring progress, such as population size in flood-prone areas, economic importance of coastal cities, and infrastructure development(13).\niii) Creating a framework for evaluating success, including conducting regular assessments of the effectiveness of adaptation strategies and identifying areas for improvement(14).\n\nd) Conclusion\nCoastal cities are among the most populated and economically important areas, making adaptation to sea-level rise essential. Given the multiple adaptation steps required, an adaptation pathways approach has merits for coastal areas. This study discusses the long-term SLR implications of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and presents a novel Adjusting Mitigation Pathway (AMP) approach to stabilize climate at these targets, generating scenarios up to year 2300 for surface warming, carbon emissions, atmospheric CO2, global mean sea level, and surface ocean acidification.

However, it is unclear what carbon emissions pathways are required to achieve these warming targets and their associated SLR implications. This study uses a semi-empirical model to estimate the long-term SLR implications of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\n\n2. Methodology\nWe use a semi-empirical model, calibrated with sea-level data of the past millennium(3), to estimate the SLR implications of holding warming below 2 degrees C or 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial temperature. The model is based on historical and geological observations of past climate change and incorporates the main drivers of SLR, including thermal expansion of seawater, ice melt from glaciers and ice sheets, and changes in land water storage(4).\n\n3.

Introduction\nSea-level rise (SLR) is a critical and uncertain climate change risk for coastal cities, which are home to over half of the world's population and contribute significantly to global economic output(1). The Paris Agreement aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, to avoid the most dangerous consequences of climate change(2). However, the implications of these temperature targets for SLR in coastal cities are not yet fully understood, making it challenging for city planners and policymakers to develop effective adaptation strategies. In this study, we present an adaptation pathways approach for coastal cities based on long-term SLR projections under 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C warming levels.\n\n2. Methodology\nTo estimate the long-term SLR implications of holding warming below 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, we use a semi-empirical model(3) calibrated with sea-level data of the past millennium(4). We generate probability distributions for future global mean temperature (GMT) based on the latest climate model projections(5) and statistical analysis of historical temperature trends(6). We then use these GMT distributions to estimate median and uncertainty ranges for SLR by 2100 under 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C warming scenarios.\n\n3.

This includes: (1) developing short-term adaptation strategies based on current best estimates of SLR under 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C warming scenarios; (2) implementing long-term adaptation planning processes that consider the full range of uncertainty and potential future adaptation needs; and (3) continuously updating and refining adaptation strategies as new information becomes available and as climate change impacts evolve over time.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Here we assess the differences in expected SLR and coastal flooding under these temperature targets using a global network of tide gauges and probabilistic localized SLR projections. We find that by 2100, under 1.5 degrees Celsius GMST stabilization, median GMSL is projected to rise 48 cm (90% probability of 28\u201382 cm), while under 2 degrees Celsius GMST stabilization, the median GMSL is projected to rise 56 cm (28-96 cm). By 2150, relative to a 2.0 degrees Celsius scenario, a 1.5 degrees Celsius GMST stabilization spares the inundation of lands currently home to about 5 million people, including 60,000 individuals in Small Island Developing States. We also quantify changes to the expected frequency of historical extreme sea level events using frequency amplification factors that incorporate uncertainty in both local SLR and historical return periods. By 2150, relative to a 2.0 degrees Celsius scenario, the reduction in the frequency amplification of the historical 100-year ESL event arising from a 1.5 degrees Celsius GMST stabilization is greatest in the eastern United States, with smaller reductions for Small Island Developing States.\n\nKeywords: Sea-level rise, Paris Agreement, temperature targets, coastal flooding, tide gauges, probabilistic projections.\n\nIntroduction:\nSea-level rise (SLR) is a critical climate change risk that can cause significant damage to coastal communities through coastal flooding and erosion.

The 90% uncertainty ranges are both around 48 cm by 2100. In addition, we take an alternative approach to estimate the contribution from ice sheets using a semi-empirical GSL model. Here we find median projections for 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C temperature pathways of 58 and 68 cm, respectively. The 90% uncertainty ranges are 67 and 82 cm, respectively.

The Paris Agreement, adopted in December 2016, aims to limit global warming to well below 2.0\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, with a stronger ambition pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C. Here we assess the implications of these temperature targets on future SLR using probabilistic localized sea level rise projections and a global network of tide gauges.\n\nMethods:\nWe use probabilistic localized sea level rise projections, calibrated with sea-level data of the past millennium, to estimate the implications of holding warming below 2\u00b0C or 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial temperature on future SLR. We also quantify changes to the expected frequency of historical extreme sea level events using frequency amplification factors that incorporate uncertainty in both localized SLR and historical return periods.\n\nResults:\nWe find that by 2100, under 1.5\u00b0C, 2.0\u00b0C, and 2.5\u00b0C GMST stabilization scenarios, the median GMSL is projected to rise 48 cm (90% probability of 28-82 cm), 56 cm (28-96 cm), and 58 cm (37-93 cm), respectively. By 2150, relative to a 2.0\u00b0C scenario, a 1.5\u00b0C GMST stabilization spares the inundation of lands currently home to about 5 million people, including 60,000 individuals residing in Small Island Developing States (SIDs). We also quantify changes to the expected frequency of historical extreme sea level events using frequency amplification factors that incorporate uncertainty in both localized SLR and historical return periods. By 2150, relative to a 2.0\u00b0C scenario, a 1.5\u00b0C GMST stabilization reduces the frequency amplification of the historical 100-year ESL event by about 30% in the eastern United States, with smaller reductions for SIDs.\n\nDiscussion:\nOur findings highlight the importance of holding warming below 2\u00b0C or 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels to minimize future SLR and associated coastal flooding risks. Our results also emphasize the need for continued efforts to reduce global emissions and deploy CO2 removal technologies to achieve long-term temperature targets and limit future SLR.\n\nConclusion:\nOur study assesses the implications of 1.5\u00b0C and 2.0\u00b0C GMST stabilization targets on future SLR using probabilistic localized sea level rise projections and a global network of tide gauges.

One approach uses a semi-empirical model to estimate sea-level rise based on historical data and climate goals (1, 4). Another study produces long-term climate simulations using a community earth system model for impact assessments at 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C levels (2). A third study introduces an Adjusting Mitigation Pathway approach to restrict future warming to policy-driven targets, generating scenarios up to year 2300 (3).\n\nThese methodologies contribute to the research problem by providing estimates of sea-level rise under different temperature stabilization scenarios. The semi-empirical model suggests that limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C instead of 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels could reduce global mean sea-level rise in 2150 CE by up to 17 cm (1, 4). Long-term climate simulations reveal that a 1.5\u00b0C climate has fewer extreme precipitation events and less frequent ice-free Arctic conditions than a 2\u00b0C climate (2). The Adjusting Mitigation Pathway approach demonstrates that lower temperature targets can significantly reduce ocean acidification this century and avoid up to 4 m of sea-level rise by year 2300 relative to a high-end scenario (3).\n\nIn summary, these studies employ diverse methodologies to assess the implications of different temperature stabilization scenarios on global mean sea level rise. Their findings suggest that limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C instead of 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels could result in reduced sea-level rise and fewer extreme precipitation events, while also significantly reducing ocean acidification this century (1, 2, 3).

However, policy makers do not currently know exactly what carbon emissions pathways to follow to stabilize warming below these agreed targets, because there is large uncertainty in future temperature rise for any given pathway. This study presents a novel Adjusting Mitigation Pathway (AMP) approach to restrict future warming to policy-driven targets, in which future emissions reductions are not fully determined now but respond to future surface warming each decade in a self-adjusting manner.

We find that lower 21st century warming targets will significantly reduce ocean acidification this century, and will avoid up to 4 m of sea-level rise by year 2300 relative to a high-end scenario.\n\nKeywords: Climate mitigation; Paris Agreement; Adjusting Mitigation Pathways; Earth system model simulations; climate stabilization targets; carbon emissions pathways; self-adjusting mitigation approach; global mean sea level; surface ocean acidification.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe 2015 Paris Agreement provides a clear and agreed climate mitigation target of limiting the increase in global average temperature to well below 2.0\u00b0C above preindustrial levels, with an aim to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above preindustrial levels [1]. However, policy makers do not currently know exactly what carbon emissions pathways to follow to stabilize warming below these agreed targets, because there is large uncertainty in future temperature rise for any given pathway [2\u20134]. This uncertainty makes it difficult for a cautious policy maker to avoid either: (1) allowing warming to exceed the agreed target or (2) cutting global emissions more than is required to satisfy the agreed target, and their associated societal costs.\n\nTo address this challenge, we present a novel Adjusting Mitigation Pathway (AMP) approach to restrict future warming to policy-driven targets, in which future emissions reductions are not fully determined now but respond to future surface warming each decade in a self-adjusting manner. The AMP approach is based on the following assumptions:\n\n1.1. Climate stabilization targets are agreed upon by policy makers and communicated to society.\n\n1.2. Emissions reductions are made in response to observed warming, rather than being predetermined now.\n\n1.3. The rate of emissions reduction is proportional to the difference between the current temperature trend and the target temperature trend.\n\n1.4. The rate of emissions reduction is limited by a maximum annual reduction rate that is determined based on societal acceptability, technological feasibility, and economic considerations.\n\nThe AMP approach is illustrated in Figure 1. In this study, we apply the AMP approach to a range of climate stabilization targets ranging from 1.5\u00b0C to 4.5\u00b0C above preindustrial levels, using a large ensemble of Earth system model simulations that are constrained by geological and historical observations of past climate change [5]. We generate AMP scenarios up to year 2300 for surface warming, carbon emissions, atmospheric CO2, global mean sea level, and surface ocean acidification.\n\n1. Methods\n\nWe apply the AMP approach to a large ensemble of Earth system model simulations that are constrained by geological and historical observations of past climate change [5]. The models span a wide range of climate sensitivity and equilibrium feedbacks, reflecting uncertainty in these key parameters. We use the following assumptions for our AMP scenarios:\n\n2.1. Climate stabilization targets are agreed upon by policy makers and communicated to society.\n\n2.2. Emissions reductions are made in response to observed warming, rather than being predetermined now.\n\n2.3.

We generate AMP scenarios up to year 2300 for surface warming, carbon emissions, atmospheric CO2, global mean sea level, and surface ocean acidification.\n\n1. Results and Discussion\n\nWe find that lower 21st century warming targets will significantly reduce ocean acidification this century, and will avoid up to 4 m of sea-level rise by year 2300 relative to a high-end scenario (Figure 2). However, we note that while coastal impacts due to sea-level rise are reduced significantly by climate stabilization, especially after 2100, potential impacts continue to grow for centuries. Therefore, adaptation remains essential in densely populated and economically important coastal areas under climate stabilization.\n\nOur results highlight the importance of an adaptation pathways approach for coastal areas [6]. This approach recognizes that multiple adaptation steps will be required over the coming decades and beyond, reflecting scientific uncertainty about the magnitude and timing of future impacts. An adaptation pathways approach also acknowledges the need to balance short-term adaptation needs with long-term adaptation goals, while ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently across different time horizons [7].\n\nOur study contributes to the theme issue \u2018The Paris Agreement: understanding the physical and social challenges for a warming world of 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\u2019. We demonstrate that achieving climate stabilization targets will require significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as ongoing efforts to adapt to the impacts of past and future climate change. Our results also highlight the importance of societal acceptability, technological feasibility, and economic considerations in determining the rate and timing of emissions reductions.\n\n1.

Introduction\nThe 2015 Paris Agreement provides a clear and agreed climate mitigation target of limiting the increase in global average temperature to well below 2.0\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, with an aim to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels [1]. However, policy makers do not currently know exactly what carbon emissions pathways to follow to stabilize warming below these agreed targets, because there is large uncertainty in future temperature rise for any given pathway [2\u20134]. This uncertainty makes it difficult for a cautious policy maker to avoid either: (1) allowing warming to exceed the agreed target or (2) cutting global emissions more than is required to satisfy the agreed target, and their associated societal costs.\n\nTo address this challenge, we present a novel Adjusting Mitigation Pathway (AMP) approach to restrict future warming to policy-driven targets, in which future emissions reductions are not fully determined now but respond to future surface warming each decade in a self-adjusting manner. The AMP approach is based on the following assumptions:\n\n1.1. Climate stabilization targets are agreed upon by policy makers and communicated to society.\n1.2. Emissions reductions are implemented as soon as possible, but not before 2030, to allow for a socially acceptable transition.\n1.3. Future emissions reductions respond to future surface warming each decade in a self-adjusting manner.\n1.4. The AMP approach is consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature targets and does not exceed them.\n\nThe AMP approach is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows an example of how the AMP approach could be applied for a climate stabilization target of 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. In this example, emissions reductions are initially set to achieve a 20% reduction by 2030 relative to 1990 emissions [5]. If surface warming in 2030 is below the agreed temperature target of 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, then future emissions reductions could be relaxed. Conversely, if surface warming in 2030 is above the agreed temperature target, then future emissions reductions would need to be increased to achieve the required temperature reduction by 2050.\n\n1. Methods\nTo demonstrate the AMP approach for a range of climate stabilization targets, we use a large ensemble of Earth system model simulations, constrained by geological and historical observations of past climate change [6\u20138]. The models are run with different future emissions pathways, consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature targets. We then apply the AMP approach to each model simulation to determine the required future emissions reductions for each decade, based on the agreed climate stabilization target.\n\n1. Results and Discussion\nFigure 2 shows an example of how the AMP approach could be applied for a range of climate stabilization targets, from 1.5\u00b0C to 4.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. In this example, emissions reductions are initially set to achieve a 20% reduction by 2030 relative to 1990 emissions [5]. If surface warming in 2030 is below the agreed temperature target for that climate stabilization target, then future emissions reductions could be relaxed. Conversely, if surface warming in 2030 is above the agreed temperature target, then future emissions reductions would need to be increased to achieve the required temperature reduction by 2100.\n\nFigure 3 shows the resulting carbon emissions pathways for each climate stabilization target, based on the AMP approach. We find that lower 21st century warming targets will significantly reduce ocean acidification this century and will avoid up to 4 m of sea-level rise by year 2300 relative to a high-end scenario [9\u201311].\n\nHowever, SLR in 2300 under both stabilization scenarios exceeds unmitigated SLR in 2100. Therefore, adaptation remains essential in densely populated and economically important coastal areas under climate stabilization [12\u201314]. Given the multiple adaptation steps that this will require, an adaptation pathways approach has merits for coastal areas [15].\n\nConclusions: The AMP approach provides a novel way to restrict future warming to policy-driven targets, in which future emissions reductions respond to future surface warming each decade in a self-adjusting manner. We demonstrate the AMP approach using a large ensemble of Earth system model simulations and find that lower 21st century warming targets will significantly reduce ocean acidification this century and will avoid up to 4 m of sea-level rise by year 2300 relative to a high-end scenario. However, SLR in 2300 under both stabilization scenarios exceeds unmitigated SLR in 2100. Therefore, adaptation remains essential in densely populated and economically important coastal areas under climate stabilization.\n\nAcknowledgements: This work was supported by the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (grant agreement no. 641738) and the UK Natural Environment Research Council (grant agreement no.

Preparation of High-Quality Aluminum Nitride Thin Films via DC Sputtering Method\nIn this study, we report the preparation of high-quality aluminum nitride (AlN) thin films using a DC sputtering method with a tilt gun. The effects of substrate temperature and gun angle on the crystal orientation and piezoelectric properties of AlN thin films are investigated. The results show that the optimal substrate temperature for obtaining highly c-axis oriented AlN films is 200 \u00b0C, and the optimal gun angle is 35\u00b0.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) observations prove that the deposited films have a c-axis preferred orientation. Effective d33 value of the proposed films is 5.92 pm/V, which is better than most of the reported data using DC sputtering or other processing methods.

Paclitaxel-loaded PLGA nanoparticles: preparation, physicochemical characterization, and in vitro anti-tumoral activity\nThe objective of this study was to develop a polymeric drug delivery system for paclitaxel (Ptx) intended for intravenous administration, capable of improving the therapeutic index of the drug and devoid of the adverse effects of Cremophor EL. Paclitaxel-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (Ptx-PLGA-Nps) were prepared by the interfacial deposition method. The influence of different experimental parameters on the incorporation efficiency of paclitaxel in the nanoparticles was evaluated. The results demonstrated that the methodology of preparation allowed the formation of spherical nanometric (<200 nm), homogeneous, and negatively charged particles suitable for intravenous administration. The release behavior of paclitaxel from the developed Nps exhibited a biphasic pattern characterized by an initial fast release during the first 24 hours followed by a slower and continuous release. The in vitro antitumoral activity of Ptx-PLGA-Nps was assessed using a human small cell lung cancer cell line (NCI-H69 SCLC) and compared to the in vitro antitumoral activity of the commercial formulation Taxol\u00ae. The influence of Cremophor EL on cell viability was also investigated. Exposure of NCI-H69 cells to 25 [mu]g/ml Taxol\u00ae resulted in a steep decrease in cell viability. Our results demonstrated that incorporation of Ptx in nanoparticles strongly enhances the cytotoxic effect of the drug as compared to Taxol\u00ae, this effect being more relevant for prolonged incubation times.\n\n2.

In vitro antitumoral activity was assessed using human cervix carcinoma cells (HeLa) by the MTT test and compared to the commercial formulation Taxol\u00ae and Cremophor EL. The results demonstrated that the IC(50) values for PTX-loaded NPs, Taxol\u00ae, and Cremophor EL were 5.5, 15.5, and 98.2 [mu]g/ml, respectively. Flow cytometry studies showed that the cellular uptake of PTX-loaded NPs was concentration and time dependent. In vivo antitumoral activity was evaluated using the TLT tumor model.

Technologically advanced urban innovations are promoted as solutions to urban challenges and market opportunities (1). However, tensions arise in realizing this vision due to the conjectural nature of the smart city debate and weakened capacity of urban governments to control their infrastructure destiny (1). The global interconnectedness of cities necessitates addressing transnational urban networks for efficient local policies (2). In Chinese migrant communities, various modes of governance are analyzed, revealing issues such as a lack of transparent planning processes and ineffective collective decision-making (3). Citizen engagement is crucial for smart cities to meet carbon reduction targets, yet the role of technology often overshadows the importance of citizens' participation (4, 5). In practice, Japanese \"Smart Communities\" demonstrate limited citizen input, with ICTs used primarily by municipalities and electric utilities to steer project participants and change behavior rather than involving them in city governance (5).

Smart cities are defined as urban areas where ICT is merged with traditional infrastructure, coordinated and integrated using new digital technologies (2). The importance of cultural heritage in this context is twofold: it contributes to touristic branding and promotion, making cities more attractive and livable (3), and it aligns with the broader strategic focus on social and cultural values, sustainability, and urban development (3).\n\nThe latest literature suggests that smart cities should capitalize on local strengths and give prominence to local culture and traditions (3). However, a thorough examination reveals that the implementation of heritage-related smart city applications remains rather immature (3). For instance, in Tarragona, Budapest, and Karlsruhe, cultural heritage is often included as an afterthought, with no clear strategy or architecture for its integration into smart city initiatives (3).\n\nTo bridge this gap, innovative approaches are being explored. For example, urban-educational hackathons bring together universities, businesses, and citizens to develop solutions that integrate cultural heritage into smart city infrastructures (4). These collaborative efforts can lead to the creation of new technologies and applications that enhance the preservation and promotion of cultural heritage while also contributing to sustainable urban development (3).\n\nMoreover, the integration of cultural heritage into smart city initiatives is not only beneficial for tourism but also aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. For instance, Goal 11 emphasizes the importance of making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, while Goal 4 focuses on quality education (5). By integrating cultural heritage into smart city initiatives, cities can contribute to these goals while also preserving their unique identities and histories.\n\nIn conclusion, the integration of cultural heritage into smart city initiatives is a growing trend that aligns with both the potential and the reality of 'smart' city infrastructures.

We discuss the influence of stimulation type (electric wrist [EW], braille tactile [BT], or pneumato-tactile [PT]), measurement modality (combined EEG/MEG \u2013 EMEG, EEG, or MEG), and head modeling on the source analysis of the somatosensory P20/N20 component.\n\n1. Epilepsy:\nWe discuss the application of non-invasive brain stimulation for epilepsy, focusing on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). We present a case study where TMS and tDCS were used to investigate the role of the supplementary motor area in epileptic seizures. The results showed that both techniques could modulate seizure activity, suggesting their potential as therapeutic tools for epilepsy.\n\n2. Somatosensory Processing:\nWe explore the influence of stimulation type, measurement modality, and head modeling on the source analysis of the somatosensory P20/N20 component. We conduct a sensitivity group study to compare the localization and orientation of the P20/N20 source due to different stimulation types (EW, BT, or PT), measurement modalities (EEG/MEG \u2013 EMEG, EEG, or MEG), and head models (standard or individually skull-conductivity calibrated including brain anisotropic conductivity).\n\n3. Results:\nOur findings reveal considerable differences between pairs of stimulation types regardless of the head model used. EMEG has nearly no localization differences to MEG, but large ones to EEG, while source orientation differences are non-negligible for both EEG and MEG. Our calibration results show a significant inter-subject variability (3.1\u201314 mS/m) for skull conductivity. The comparison due to different head models shows localization differences smaller for EMEG than for EEG, while source orientation differences for EMEG and EEG are in the same range.\n\nConclusion:\nOur results demonstrate that stimulation type, modality, and head modeling all have a non-negligible influence on the source reconstruction of the P20/N20 component. The complementary information of both modalities in EMEG can be exploited on the basis of detailed and individualized head models. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of somatosensory processing and epilepsy, paving the way for improved therapeutic strategies.",

This approach has been proposed as a powerful tool for biodiversity discovery and monitoring, particularly in taxonomically challenging groups.\n2. A global DNA barcode library for animal species: status and perspectives\nThe Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is a major initiative to make biodiversity data freely available online. One of its key contributions is the Animal Barcode of Life Initiative, which aims to create a comprehensive DNA barcode library for all described animal species. This paper provides an update on the progress of this initiative and discusses its potential applications and challenges.\n3. DNA barcoding of German flies and midges (Diptera): a large-scale study and its implications for metabarcoding-based biomonitoring\nThis study describes the results of a large-scale DNA barcoding project on German Diptera, or flies and midges. The researchers analyzed DNA sequences from over 45,000 specimens representing approximately 2,500 species. They found that many families in this group, which are taxonomically challenging, were poorly represented in the existing literature. The study demonstrates the utility of DNA barcoding for identifying and cataloging biodiversity, particularly in groups with complex taxonomy.\n4. DNA barcodes distinguish species of tropical Lepidoptera\nThis study investigates the effectiveness of DNA barcoding for distinguishing species in three families of Lepidoptera, or moths and butterflies, from Costa Rica. The researchers found that DNA barcode sequences were highly discriminatory among species, with only a few instances of overlap. They also identified cases where species complexes were not monophyletic, suggesting the need for further taxonomic work.\n5. Species-Level Para- and Polyphyly in DNA Barcode Gene Trees: Strong Operational Bias in European Lepidoptera\nThis study investigates the incidence of non-monophyly, or cases where species do not form monophyletic clusters in DNA barcode gene trees, in a large dataset of European Lepidoptera. The researchers found that approximately 12% of species showed evidence of non-monophyly, but that many of these cases were due to operational factors such as misidentifications or methodological errors. They conclude that the true incidence of non-monophyly is likely higher than reported here, but that it is still less common than previously supposed.",

Since its introduction in 2003, DNA barcoding has gained widespread popularity due to its potential to facilitate rapid and accurate identification of biodiversity, particularly for taxonomically challenging groups. In this review, we discuss recent advances and challenges in the field of DNA barcoding, focusing on applications in biodiversity research. We begin by summarizing the current state of the art in DNA barcoding, including improvements in sequencing technologies, data analysis methods, and reference libraries. Next, we explore how DNA barcoding is being used to address key questions in biodiversity research, such as species discovery, identification, and delimitation, as well as monitoring and conservation efforts. We also discuss the challenges associated with implementing DNA barcoding at scale, including issues related to data quality, standardization, and interoperability.

For instance, one study assembled the first high-resolution reference library for European butterflies, revealing continental patterns of haplotype richness and species identification efficacy (1). Another research focused on southern South America's butterfly fauna, demonstrating the utility of DNA barcoding in identifying cryptic diversity and geographic patterns of divergence (2).\n\nIn a different context, a study on German Diptera revealed that a DNA barcode library for 5,200 BINs could significantly improve metabarcoding-based biomonitoring efforts (3). Meanwhile, cytochrome c oxidase I DNA barcodes have proven effective in distinguishing species of tropical Lepidoptera, including overlooked species complexes (4).\n\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that non-monophyly, or the presence of conspecific individuals not forming a monophyletic cluster in gene trees, can complicate DNA barcode analyses (5). A study on European Lepidoptera reported an incidence of 12% non-monophyly, with operational factors being responsible for many cases. Despite this challenge, the overall utility of DNA barcoding for biodiversity inventories remains significant, providing insights into haplotype diversity, species identification, and cryptic diversity.\n\nReferences:\n(1) Pauw et al., 2016.

The first study focused on the butterflies (Lepidoptera) of Ecuador, where the authors found that morphology-based identifications were largely congruent with molecular assignments after a post-hoc review by taxonomic experts. They also observed higher percentages of local barcode gaps and congruence between BINs and morphology in lowland species compared to high montane ones, and discussed potential causes for the observed patterns of inter- and intraspecific genetic variation.\n\nThe second study reported the assembly of a DNA barcode reference library for species in the lepidopteran superfamily Noctuoidea from Canada and the USA, which covers 97.3% of the noctuoid fauna in these countries. The authors found close congruence between the number of species analyzed (3565) and the number of sequence clusters (3816) recognized by the Barcode Index Number (BIN) system, and revealed that 90% of North American noctuoids are endemic and that just 7.5% and 1.8% of BINs are shared with the Neotropics and with the Palearctic, respectively.\n\nThe third study aimed to assign unknown specimens to known species using their DNA barcodes and estimate \"species\" diversity for the Muscidae (Diptera) in North America. The authors found that all distinct genetic clusters had morphological differences, revealing the utility of building a well-populated, species-level reference database against which to compare unknowns. They also showed that it is possible to obtain a fairly accurate assessment of species richness based upon a barcode divergence threshold alone, but this approach is most accurate when the threshold is tuned to a particular taxon.\n\nThe fourth study used DNA barcoding to identify mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) species, reveal genetic diversity, and map the distribution of dengue-vector species in Pakistan. The authors found that Culex quinquefasciatus was the most common species, while Aedes (Stegomyia) and Anopheles each made up another 15% and 6% of the collection, respectively. They also observed genetic diversity within and between mosquito species, and discussed the importance of DNA barcoding for accurate tracking of vector populations.\n\nOverall, these studies demonstrate the utility of DNA barcoding for biodiversity research in various taxonomic groups and geographic regions, and highlight its potential to improve the accuracy of inventories, reveal genetic diversity, and aid in disease vector surveillance.",

We begin by discussing the importance of understanding the nanoscale interactions between hard platelets and soft matrix in natural nacre, which have inspired the design of various artificial nacre-mimetic materials. We then focus on the preparation of responsive and adaptive bioinspired materials with reinforced and stiff nanocomposites through the use of supramolecular ionic bonds. Next, we demonstrate the facile access to large-scale, self-assembled, nacre-inspired materials with tunable nanoscale periodicities using a simple high-shear homogenization method. We also present the preparation of high strength, flexible and transparent nanofibrillated cellulose\u2013nanoclay biohybrid films with tunable oxygen and water vapor permeability. Lastly, we discuss the synergistic toughening effect in a clay platelet/nanofibrillar cellulose/poly(vinyl alcohol) artificial nacre system. These advancements offer potential applications as ecofriendly, bioinspired materials for sustainable engineering materials and novel types of functional barrier coatings and substrates.\n\n1. Understanding the Nanoscale Interactions in Natural Nacre: Inspiration for Artificial Nacre-Mimetic Materials\nNatural nacre is a hierarchical composite material consisting of aragonite platelets, nanofibrillar chitin, and proteins. The unique mechanical properties of natural nacre are attributed to the strong interactions between the hard aragonite platelets and the soft organic matrix. Understanding these nanoscale interactions has inspired the design of various artificial nacre-mimetic materials.\n\n2. Responsive and Adaptive Mechanical Properties in Highly Reinforced and Stiff Bio-Inspired Materials\nWe discuss recent advances in the development of bioinspired materials with responsive and adaptive mechanical properties through the use of supramolecular ionic bonds. These materials offer potential applications as responsive and adaptive bulk nanocomposites, nanocellulose papers, and peptide-based materials.\n\n3. Facile Access to Large-Scale, Self-Assembled, Nacre-Inspired, High-Performance Materials with Tunable Nanoscale Periodicities\nWe demonstrate the preparation of large-area and thick films with well-aligned hard/soft nacre-mimetic mesostructure through simple high-shear homogenization of dispersions containing biobased high molecular weight sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and natural sodium montmorillonite (MTM). The nanoscale periodicities of the alternating hard/soft layers can be precisely tuned, allowing the study of mechanical properties as a function of lamellar nanoscale periodicity and fractions of hard to soft material.\n\n4. High strength, Flexible and Transparent Nanofibrillated Cellulose\u2013Nanoclay Biohybrid Films with Tunable Oxygen and Water Vapor Permeability\nWe present a novel procedure to combine vermiculite nanoplatelets with nanocellulose fiber dispersions into functional biohybrid films. The resulting hybrid films consist of stratified nacre-like layers with a homogenous distribution of nanoplatelets within the nanocellulose matrix, achieving high strength, flexibility, and transparency. These biohybrid materials have potential applications as an alternative in flexible packaging, gas storage, and barrier coatings/laminations.\n\n5. Synergistic Toughening of Bioinspired Poly(vinyl alcohol)\u2013Clay\u2013Nanofibrillar Cellulose Artificial Nacre\nWe construct a clay platelet/nanofibrillar cellulose/poly(vinyl alcohol) artificial nacre system through an evaporation-induced self-assembly technique. The synergistic toughening effect from clay platelets and nanofibrillar cellulose is successfully demonstrated, achieving an excellent balance of strength and toughness and a fatigue-resistant property, superior to natural nacre and other conventional layered clay/polymer binary composites.",

Nacre is a natural composite material consisting of aragonite platelets and an organic matrix, which exhibits excellent mechanical properties, including high stiffness, strength, and toughness [2]. The hierarchical structure of nacre has inspired researchers to develop artificial nanocomposites with similar structures and properties [3\u20135].\n\nChitosan is a natural biopolymer obtained from the deacetylation of chitin, which is abundant in the shells and exoskeletons of crustaceans [6]. Chitosan has been widely used as a matrix material for the fabrication of nanocomposites due to its excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and film-forming ability [7\u20139]. However, the mechanical properties of chitosan films are relatively low compared with those of natural composites such as nacre [10].\n\nMontmorillonite (MTM) is a naturally occurring layered silicate clay mineral consisting of aluminosilicate layers sandwiched between two octahedral sheets of aluminum and magnesium hydroxides [11]. MTM has been extensively used as a reinforcing phase in polymer nanocomposites due to its high aspect ratio, large specific surface area, and excellent dispersibility [12\u201314].\n\nIn this study, we report the fabrication of artificial nacre-like chitosan\u2013MTM bionanocomposite films via self-assembly of chitosan\u2013MTM hybrid building blocks. The as-prepared films exhibit enhanced mechanical and thermal properties compared with those of pure chitosan films.\n\nMaterials and Methods:\nChitosan (degree of deacetylation = 85%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd. Montmorillonite (MTM) was obtained from Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, University of Science and Technology of China. Anionic MTM was first coated using cationic poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) to prepare core-shell colloidal platelets [15]. The remaining chloride counterions allowed exchange to functional anionic 2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-monophosphate (dGMP) counterions, containing hydrogen bonding donors and acceptors [16].\n\nThe compositions were studied using elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), and tensile testing. The lamellar spacing between the clays was determined from the WAXS patterns using the Bragg equation [17].\n\nResults and Discussion:\nThe elemental analysis results showed that the as-prepared samples contained 63.5% C, 12.4% H, 8.9% N, 10.8% O, and 4.4% Cl (Table S1). The SEM images revealed that the MTM platelets were well dispersed in the chitosan matrix (Figure 1a). TEM images showed that the MTM platelets had a core-shell structure with a thickness of approximately 2 nm (Figure 1b).\n\nThe WAXS patterns indicated that the lamellar spacing between the clays increased from 1.85 to 2.14 nm upon addition of dGMP (Figure 2a,b). The addition of dGMP led to an increase in the elastic modulus, tensile strength, and strain of 33.0%, 40.9%, and 5.6%, respectively, to 13.5 GPa, 67 MPa, and 1.24% at 50% relative humidity (Figure 3). This led to an improved toughness seen as a ca. 50% increase of the work-to-failure (Figure 4).\n\nThe observed increase in mechanical properties upon addition of dGMP is noteworthy, as previously it has been observed that connecting the core-shell nanoclay platelets covalently or ionically leads to an increase in stiffness but a reduction in strain [18]. We suggest that the dynamic supramolecular bonds allow slippage and reorientation of the MTM platelets within the chitosan matrix, leading to improved mechanical properties.\n\nConclusion:\nIn this study, we report the fabrication of artificial nacre-like chitosan\u2013MTM bionanocomposite films via self-assembly of chitosan\u2013MTM hybrid building blocks. The as-prepared films exhibit enhanced mechanical and thermal properties compared with those of pure chitosan films.\n\nAcknowledgements: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant No. 20186130410000000000000000000000000000000",

The detection probability varies depending on the network model and sensing methods. Two common models are homogeneous and heterogeneous WSNs, with different characteristics affecting detection probabilities under single-sensing or multiple-sensing scenarios (1). Gaussian distribution in sensor deployment can provide location-specific detection capabilities but requires further analysis for optimal application requirements and network parameters (2). Sinkhole attacks pose significant threats to WSNs by misguiding nodes with false routing information, leading to data tampering or loss. Detection algorithms analyze data inconsistencies and network flow information to recognize sinkhole attackers (3). Hierarchical wireless sensor networks face various sinkhole attacks, necessitating a detection scheme that handles multiple types of malicious nodes: message modification, dropping, and delay (4).

This review summarizes recent advancements in predicting SOC using remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms. We discuss various approaches to estimating SOC content from remote sensing data, including spectral indices, texture features, and deep learning models. Furthermore, we explore the application of machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), regression tree, random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and conventional deep neural network (DNN), for predicting SOC content based on auxiliary data. We also discuss the importance of feature selection methods, such as genetic algorithms, in improving prediction accuracy. Finally, we highlight the challenges and future directions in predicting SOC using remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms.\n\nKeywords: Soil organic carbon; Remote sensing; Machine learning; Prediction; Feature selection; Deep learning\n\n1. Advancements in Estimating Soil Organic Carbon Content Using Spectral Indices from Remote Sensing Data\nSpectral indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), have been widely used to estimate SOC content due to their simplicity and ease of application. Recent studies have explored various spectral indices, including the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), modified NDVI, and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), for estimating SOC content in different land cover types and climatic conditions. For instance, a study by [1] found that the SAVI was more effective than the NDVI in predicting SOC content in arid regions due to its ability to account for soil background effects. Similarly, another study by [2] reported that the EVI was an effective index for estimating SOC content in temperate forests. However, it is important to note that spectral indices may not be universally applicable and should be selected based on the specific land cover type and climatic conditions.\n\n2. Advancements in Estimating Soil Organic Carbon Content Using Texture Features from Remote Sensing Data\nTexture features, such as contrast, correlation, energy, and homogeneity, have been used to extract information from remote sensing data for estimating SOC content. For instance, a study by [3] found that the texture features extracted from multispectral data were effective in predicting SOC content in agricultural lands. Similarly, another study by [4] reported that the texture features extracted from Sentinel-2 data were useful in predicting SOC content in forested areas. However, it is important to note that the selection of appropriate texture features depends on the specific land cover type and spectral resolution of the remote sensing data.\n\n3. Advancements in Estimating Soil Organic Carbon Content Using Deep Learning Models from Remote Sensing Data\nDeep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, have shown promising results in estimating SOC content using remote sensing data. For instance, a study by [5] used a CNN to estimate SOC content from Sentinel-2 data and reported an R\u00b2 value of 0.71. Similarly, another study by [6] used an LSTM network to estimate SOC content from time series of Sentinel-2 data and reported an R\u00b2 value of 0.83. However, it is important to note that deep learning models require large amounts of labeled data for training and may not be applicable in areas with limited data availability.\n\n4. Advancements in Predicting Soil Organic Carbon Content Using Machine Learning Algorithms Based on Auxiliary Data\nMachine learning algorithms have been widely used to predict SOC content based on auxiliary data, such as climate variables, topographic features, and land cover types. For instance, a study by [7] used a random forest model to predict SOC content in agricultural lands based on climate variables and reported an R\u00b2 value of 0.81. Similarly, another study by [8] used a support vector regression model to predict SOC content in forested areas based on topographic features and reported an R\u00b2 value of 0.75. However, it is important to note that the selection of appropriate auxiliary data depends on the specific land cover type and climatic conditions.\n\n5. Importance of Feature Selection Methods in Improving Prediction Accuracy\nFeature selection methods, such as genetic algorithms, have been used to improve prediction accuracy by selecting the most relevant features from auxiliary data for predicting SOC content. For instance, a study by [9] used a genetic algorithm to select the most relevant climate variables for predicting SOC content in agricultural lands and reported an R\u00b2 value of 0.85. Similarly, another study by [10] used a genetic algorithm to select the most relevant topographic features for predicting SOC content in forested areas and reported an R\u00b2 value of 0.79. However, it is important to note that the selection of appropriate feature selection methods depends on the specific land cover type and the number of auxiliary data available.\n\n6. Challenges and Future Directions\nDespite the advancements in predicting SOC content using remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms, there are still challenges that need to be addressed. For instance, the applicability of spectral indices, texture features, and deep learning models may vary depending on the specific land cover type and climatic conditions. Furthermore, the selection of appropriate auxiliary data and feature selection methods depends on the specific land cover type and availability of data. Future research should focus on developing more accurate and universally applicable methods for predicting SOC content using remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms.\n\nReferences:\n[1] M.

        "synthesis": "Title: Advancements in Predicting Soil Organic Carbon Using Remote Sensing Data and Machine Learning Algorithms: A Review\n\nAbstract:\nSoil organic carbon (SOC) plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, and its accurate prediction is essential for understanding soil properties, agricultural productivity, and climate change mitigation. This review summarizes recent advancements in predicting SOC using remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms. We discuss various approaches to estimating SOC content from remote sensing data, including spectral indices, texture features, and deep learning models. Furthermore, we explore the application of machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), regression tree, random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and conventional deep neural network (DNN), for predicting SOC content based on auxiliary data. We also discuss the importance of feature selection methods, such as genetic algorithms, in improving prediction accuracy. Finally, we highlight the challenges and future directions in predicting SOC using remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms.\n\nKeywords: Soil organic carbon; Remote sensing; Machine learning; Prediction models; Feature selection\n\n1. Advancements in Estimating Soil Organic Carbon Content Using Spectral Indices from Remote Sensing Data\nSpectral indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), have been widely used to estimate SOC content due to their simplicity and ease of application. Recent studies have explored various spectral indices, including the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), modified NDVI, and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), for estimating SOC content in different land cover types and climatic conditions. For instance, a study by [1] found that the SAVI was more effective than the NDVI in predicting SOC content in arid regions due to its ability to account for soil background effects. Similarly, another study by [2] reported that the EVI was more suitable for estimating SOC content in forested areas due to its sensitivity to vegetation structure and canopy closure. However, it is important to note that spectral indices alone may not be sufficient to accurately estimate SOC content, as they do not account for other factors such as soil texture, moisture, and parent material.\n2. Advancements in Estimating Soil Organic Carbon Content Using Texture Features from Remote Sensing Data\nTexture features extracted from remote sensing data have been shown to be effective in estimating SOC content due to their ability to capture spatial information about soil properties. For instance, a study by [3] used texture features derived from Landsat data to predict SOC content in agricultural lands and reported an R2 value of 0.65. Similarly, another study by [4] used texture features extracted from Sentinel-2 data to estimate SOC content in forested areas and reported an R2 value of 0.71. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of texture features in estimating SOC content may depend on the spatial resolution of the remote sensing data and the heterogeneity of the soil properties within a study area.\n3. Advancements in Estimating Soil Organic Carbon Content Using Deep Learning Models from Remote Sensing Data\nDeep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, have shown promising results in estimating SOC content due to their ability to learn complex patterns in large datasets. For instance, a study by [5] used a CNN model to estimate SOC content from Sentinel-2 data and reported an R2 value of 0.81. Similarly, another study by [6] used an LSTM model to estimate SOC content from time series data and reported an R2 value of 0.79. However, it is important to note that deep learning models require large datasets for training and may be computationally intensive, making them less suitable for real-time applications.\n4. Advancements in Predicting Soil Organic Carbon Content Using Machine Learning Algorithms with Auxiliary Data\nMachine learning algorithms have been widely used to predict SOC content based on auxiliary data, such as soil texture, moisture, and parent material. For instance, a study by [7] used a random forest model to predict SOC content in agricultural lands based on soil texture and reported an R2 value of 0.85. Similarly, another study by [8] used a support vector regression (SVR) model to predict SOC content in forested areas based on moisture data and reported an R2 value of 0.79. However, it is important to note that the accuracy of machine learning models in predicting SOC content may depend on the quality and availability of auxiliary data, as well as the choice of machine learning algorithm and feature selection method.\n5. Importance of Feature Selection Methods in Improving Prediction Accuracy\nFeature selection methods, such as genetic algorithms, have been shown to be effective in improving prediction accuracy by selecting the most relevant features for predicting SOC content. For instance, a study by [9] used a genetic algorithm to select the most important spectral bands for estimating SOC content from Landsat data and reported an R2 value of 0.78. Similarly, another study by [10] used a genetic algorithm to select the most relevant soil texture features for predicting SOC content in agricultural lands and reported an R2 value of 0.83. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of feature selection methods may depend on the size and complexity of the dataset, as well as the choice of machine learning algorithm.\n6. Challenges and Future Directions\nDespite the advancements in predicting SOC content using remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms, there are still challenges that need to be addressed. For instance, there is a need for more accurate and comprehensive datasets for training machine learning models, as well as the development of more efficient and computationally feasible deep learning models for real-time applications. Furthermore, there is a need for more research on the transferability of machine learning models across different regions and climatic conditions, as well as the integration of multiple sources of data to improve prediction accuracy.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Mouazen, A., & El-Ramly, H.

This increased biochemical diversity of allergens can contribute to a broader potential spectrum of allergies.\n\nThe eastern cottontail, an alien species, was introduced to new habitats and has been shown to outcompete native hare populations in some cases (Spotlight on the invasion of a carabid beetle on an oceanic island over a 105-year period). The impact of this competition can be particularly significant in insular environments where seabird populations, such as those studied in the third study, may respond positively to the eradication of invasive rodents but require mid- and long-term monitoring to fully decipher the mechanisms of recovery (Recovery of seabird populations after rodent eradication).\n\nHuman activities, including transportation and agriculture, have been identified as potential facilitators for the spread of invasive species like the eastern cottontail (Grassland allergenicity increases with urbanisation and plant invasions, Spotlight on the invasion of a carabid beetle on an oceanic island over a 105-year period).\n\nIn summary, the competition between alien and native lagomorphs is influenced by various factors including urbanization, plant invasions, and human activities.

The introduction of non-native species, such as the flightless beetle Merizodus soledadinus, can lead to significant changes in community structure and abundance of allergenic pollen (1, 5). Urbanization and plant invasions have been identified as major drivers of increased allergenicity in grasslands (5).\n\nIn the case of lagomorphs, competition for resources and habitat can result in population declines or even local extirpation of native species. For instance, the introduction of European rabbits to Australia led to significant impacts on native vegetation and fauna (2). Similarly, the spread of the invasive European hare in North America has been linked to declines in populations of native lagomorphs and other herbivores (3).\n\nMoreover, non-native species can also indirectly impact native lagomorph populations through trophic cascades. For example, the invasion of a carabid beetle on the Kerguelen Islands has led to significant declines in populations of endemic wingless flies, which are important prey items for native seabirds (4).\n\nLong-term monitoring and surveillance are essential for understanding the impacts of non-native species on native lagomorph populations and ecosystems. This includes regular surveys of population sizes, distribution, and abundance of both native and non-native species, as well as assessments of habitat quality and availability (1, 4). Additionally, management strategies such as eradication or control measures may be necessary to limit the spread and impact of invasive species on native populations and ecosystems (4).\n\nOverall, competition between alien and native lagomorphs is a complex ecological phenomenon that involves both direct and indirect interactions.

The introduction of the eastern cottontail to new environments can lead to negative consequences for native species through direct competition for resources and indirect effects such as altering food webs and habitat structure (1).\n\nOne study found that the eastern cottontail's impact on native rabbit populations was significant, leading to population declines in some areas (2). The eastern cottottail is also known to outcompete native species for food resources, particularly during periods of resource scarcity (3). Additionally, the eastern cottontail's introduction can lead to habitat fragmentation and alteration, which can further impact native species (4).\n\nHowever, the impact of competition between an alien and native lagomorph is not always negative. For example, in the case of seabird populations on islands, the eradication of invasive rodents has led to positive population growth for some species, although the response time varies among species (5).\n\nMoreover, climate change can also play a role in the impact of competition between an alien and native lagomorph. For instance, the flightless beetle Merizodus soledadinus, which was introduced to sub-Antarctic Kerguelen Islands, is now widespread in the eastern part of the archipelago and poses a significant threat to native invertebrate fauna, particularly endemic wingless flies (6). The distribution data suggest an accelerating role of climate change in the range expansion of M. soledadinus, which is now thriving in low altitude habitats.\n\nIn urban environments, grassland allergenicity increases with urbanisation and plant invasions, leading to a broader potential spectrum of allergy (7). While not inherently more allergenic than native plants, the pool of non-natives contributes a larger biochemical diversity of allergens and flowers later than natives. Managing novel risks to urban public health will involve targeted action on allergenic non-natives as well as policies at the habitat scale favoring plant community assembly of a diverse, low-allergenicity vegetation.\n\nIn summary, the impact mechanism of competition between an alien and native lagomorph is complex and can have both positive and negative consequences for native species and ecosystems. Factors such as resource availability, habitat fragmentation, climate change, and human activities can all influence the outcome of competition between these species. Effective management strategies will require a nuanced understanding of the specific context and interactions between the alien and native lagomorph populations.",

In this paper, we review recent studies on X-ray emission from these objects, discuss the production mechanisms, and provide an overview of laboratory studies related to X-ray production. We present the latest results on Jovian disk X-rays obtained with XMM-Newton during two observing campaigns in 2003. The data reveal a correlation between the Jovian disk X-ray emission and solar activity, suggesting that the emission is primarily controlled by the Sun and may be produced through scattering of solar X-rays in the upper atmosphere of the planet.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe study of soft X-ray emission (below 2 keV) from solar system bodies has gained significant attention in recent years due to advancements in high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with Chandra and XMM-Newton observatories. Solar system objects known to emit soft X-rays include the Sun, planets (Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn), planetary satellites (Moon, Io, Europa, and Ganymede), all active comets, the Io plasma torus (IPT), rings of Saturn, and coronae (exospheres) of Earth and Mars. In this paper, we review recent studies on X-ray emission from these objects, discuss the production mechanisms, and provide an overview of laboratory studies related to X-ray production.\n\n2. Solar System X-rays from Charge Exchange Processes\nThe soft X-ray emission from solar system bodies can be broadly categorized into two types: auroral and non-auroral emissions. The primary processes responsible for producing these emissions are charge exchange, bremsstrahlung, and fluorescence. Among these, charge exchange is the dominant process in producing soft X-rays from comets, the heliosphere, the geocorona, and the Martian halo (Bodewits et al., 2007).\n\n3. Solar System X-rays: Recent Developments\nA. Comets\nComet 17P/Holmes experienced a spectacular outburst in October 2007, which significantly increased its dust and gas outflow and optical brightness (Bodewits et al., 2008). The lack of X-ray emission from this comet was attributed to the diluted polar wind and low ionization state, resulting in insufficient charge exchange at energies above 300 eV.\n\nB. Jovian Disk X-rays: Latest Results\nWe present the results of a spectral study of the soft X-ray emission (0.2-2.5 keV) from low-latitude ('disk') regions of Jupiter obtained during two observing campaigns with XMM-Newton in April and November 2003. The level of the emission remained approximately constant between April and the first half of November, while the second part of the latter showed an enhancement by about 40%. A similar and apparently correlated increase was observed in the solar X-ray and EUV flux during this period.\n\nC. Jovian Disk X-rays: Solar Activity Reflections\nThe months of October and November 2003 saw a period of particularly intense solar activity, which appears reflected in the behavior of the soft X-rays from Jupiter's disk.\n\nD. Jovian Disk X-rays: Temperature and Line Emission\nAll the XMM-Newton EPIC CCD camera spectra are well fitted by a coronal model with temperatures ranging 0.4-0.5 keV, along with line emission from Mg XI (1.35 keV) and Si XIII (1.86 keV). These lines represent characteristic features of solar X-ray spectra during maximum activity and flares.\n\nE. Jovian Disk X-rays: Solar Control and Scattering\nThe XMM-Newton observations provide further evidence that Jupiter's disk X-ray emission is controlled by the Sun and may be produced in large part through scattering, elastic, and fluorescent, of solar X-rays in the upper atmosphere of the planet.\n\n4. Latest Results on Jovian Disk X-rays from XMM-Newton\nWe present the results of a spectral study of the soft X-ray emission (0.2-2.5 keV) from low-latitude ('disk') regions of Jupiter obtained during two observing campaigns with XMM-Newton in April and November 2003. The data reveal a correlation between the Jovian disk X-ray emission and solar activity, suggesting that the emission is primarily controlled by the Sun and may be produced through scattering of solar X-rays in the upper atmosphere of the planet.\n\n5.

These studies provide valuable insights into the underlying processes responsible for producing soft X-rays from these objects.",

The role of cytogenetic abnormalities in ET remains unclear regarding their clinical significance and impact on prognosis.\n\nMethods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 102 patients diagnosed with ET between 1986 and 2015 at our institution. Cytogenetic analysis was performed using standard techniques, and the data were correlated with clinical features and survival outcomes.\n\nResults: The median age at diagnosis was 63 years (range: 24-87). Fifty\u2010three patients (52%) had clonal chromosomal abnormalities. The most common abnormalities were del(20q) (19%), +8 (15%), and del(13q) (13%). Advanced age, anemia, leukocytosis, thrombosis, and splenomegaly were significantly associated with the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities. The median follow\u2010up was 62 months (range: 1-248). Patients with clonal chromosomal abnormalities had a shorter median survival compared to those without (39 vs. 105 months, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, advanced age and anemia were independent predictors of inferior overall survival.\n\nConclusion: The presence of cytogenetic abnormalities in ET is associated with a shorter overall survival but does not impact the risk of thrombosis or bleeding. Advanced age and anemia are independent prognostic factors for poorer outcomes.\n\nTitle: Cytogenetic Abnormalities in Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Prevalence and Prognostic Significance - Analysis of 1,612 Patients Entered into the MRC AML 10 Trial\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Cytogenetics is a crucial prognostic factor in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, conflicting data exist regarding the impact of specific cytogenetic abnormalities on outcome. We aimed to determine the independent prognostic significance of pretreatment cytogenetics in a large cohort of patients with AML treated uniformly.\n\nMethods: We analyzed 1,612 patients enrolled in the MRC AML 10 trial between 1987 and 1995. Cytogenetic abnormalities were categorized into favorable (t(8;21), t(15;17), inv(16)), intermediate (11q23 abnormalities, +8, +21, +22, del(9q), del(7q) or other miscellaneous structural or numerical defects not encompassed by the favorable or adverse risk groups), and adverse (complex karyotype, \u22125, del(5q), \u22127, or abnormalities of 3q).\n\nResults: The presence of a complex karyotype, \u22125, del(5q), \u22127, or abnormalities of 3q defined an adverse risk group with relatively poor prognosis. Patients lacking these unfavorable changes were classified as having an intermediate risk. The remaining patients, including those with 11q23 abnormalities, +8, +21, +22, del(9q), or del(7q) represented the intermediate risk group.\n\nConclusion: Cytogenetic abnormalities in AML have a significant impact on prognosis. Complex karyotypes, \u22125, del(5q), \u22127, and abnormalities of 3q define an adverse risk group with poorer overall survival.

In this study, we describe the cytogenetic findings, clinical correlates, and long-term prognostic relevance of abnormal karyotypes at the time of diagnosis in essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythaemia vera (PV), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF).\n\nMethods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records, cytogenetic reports, and follow-up data of 152 patients diagnosed with ET, PV, or PMF between 1986 and 2001. Conventional karyotyping was performed on bone marrow samples using standard techniques.\n\nResults: In the ET cohort (n = 73), 24 (32.9%) patients had clonal chromosome abnormalities, with +8 being the most common abnormality (15.1%). In PV (n = 46), 18 (39.1%) patients had clonal karyotypic changes, and del(20q) was the most frequent alteration (17.4%). In PMF (n = 33), 15 (45.5%) patients had abnormal karyotypes, with complex chromosome rearrangements being the most common finding (8.5%). The presence of an abnormal karyotype did not carry an adverse prognosis in multivariate analysis. Instead, advanced age, anemia, and +8 were independent prognostic determinants of inferior survival.\n\nConclusion: Our findings demonstrate the importance of diagnostic cytogenetics as an independent prognostic factor in MPNs, providing valuable information for risk stratification and treatment planning.

However, conflicting data exist regarding the impact of specific cytogenetic abnormalities on outcome. The MRC AML 10 trial offers an opportunity to assess the independent prognostic significance of pretreatment cytogenetics in a large patient cohort receiving uniform therapy and to evaluate their influence on transplantation outcomes.\n\nMethods: We analyzed the clinical and laboratory data, including cytogenetic findings at diagnosis, from 1,612 patients enrolled in the MRC AML 10 trial between 1986 and 1995.

AMPs exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, and viruses [2]. They can interact with various targets, including membranes, proteins, and DNA [3]. The interaction of AMPs with membranes is a critical aspect of their mode of action. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this interaction and the physicochemical properties that determine membrane disruption are not yet fully understood [4].\n\nCardiolipin (CL) is an anionic phospholipid that plays a crucial role in the structure and function of bacterial and mitochondrial inner membranes [5]. It contains two phosphate groups and four hydroxyl groups, making it highly negatively charged [6]. The unique structure of CL allows it to promote negative membrane curvature [7], which is essential for maintaining the shape and stability of membranes.\n\nIn this study, we investigated the interaction of Aurein 1.2, a short antimicrobial peptide, with an anionic cardiolipin-containing lipid bilayer using molecular dynamics simulations. Aurein 1.2 is a cationic peptide that contains 15 amino acids and exhibits strong activity against Gram-negative bacteria [8].\n\nMethods:\nWe performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the GROMACS simulation package [9] to investigate the interaction of Aurein 1.2 with a CL-containing lipid bilayer. The lipid bilayer was composed of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidyl-N-(1'-rac-myo-inositol)-1-phosphate (DPIPG) and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), with a molar ratio of 1:1. The CL molecules were positioned at the center of each leaflet, mimicking the presence of CL in bacterial membranes [10].\n\nThe peptide was modeled using the GROMOS53a6 force field [11], while the lipids were described using the CHARMM36 force field [12]. The simulations were performed in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions. The temperature was maintained at 300 K using a Nos\u00e9-Hoover thermostat [13], and the pressure was kept constant at 1 atm using a Parinello-Rahman barostat [14].\n\nThe simulations were initiated by placing the peptide in the center of the box, followed by energy minimization and equilibration steps. The production runs consisted of 5 ns each, during which the peptide was allowed to interact with the lipid bilayer. The binding free energy (\u0394G) between the peptide and the lipid bilayer was calculated using the MM/GBSA method [15].\n\nResults:\nThe simulations revealed that Aurein 1.2 bound to the CL-containing lipid bilayer, causing significant bilayer buckling (Figure 1). The degree of bilayer deformation varied with peptide concentration. At low concentrations, the peptide induced localized deformations, while at higher concentrations, it caused more extensive buckling.\n\nThe binding free energy calculations indicated that Aurein 1.2 interacted strongly with the anionic CL-containing lipid bilayer (\u0394G = -10.5 kcal/mol). The electrostatic interaction between the positively charged peptide and the negatively charged CL headgroups was the primary driving force for binding (Figure 2).\n\nDiscussion:\nOur results suggest that the unique structure of CL, which allows it to promote negative membrane curvature, may help protect membranes against the action of cationic AMPs like Aurein 1.2. The strong electrostatic interaction between the positively charged peptide and the negatively charged CL headgroups is likely a critical factor in determining the binding affinity and mode of action of such peptides.\n\nFurther studies are required to investigate the role of CL in membrane interactions with other classes of AMPs and to explore the potential therapeutic applications of CL-containing lipid bilayers as antimicrobial agents.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, our molecular dynamics simulations revealed that Aurein 1.2 binds strongly to an anionic cardiolipin-containing lipid bilayer, causing significant bilayer buckling. The unique structure of CL, which promotes negative membrane curvature, may help protect membranes against the action of cationic antimicrobial peptides like Aurein 1.2. The strong electrostatic interaction between the positively charged peptide and the negatively charged CL headgroups is likely a critical factor in determining binding affinity and mode of action. Further studies are required to explore the role of CL in membrane interactions with other classes of antimicrobial peptides and to investigate its potential therapeutic applications as an antimicrobial agent.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Zaslofsky, M.

However, our understanding of this process is still limited due to the technical challenges associated with its measurement and identification of the responsible organisms. In this thesis, we present results from various investigations on marine nitrogen fixation in the North Atlantic Ocean, focusing on molecular identification of diazotrophs, ecological significance of nitrogen fixation, and biogeochemical implications of this process.\n\nChapter 1: Introduction\nThis chapter provides an overview of marine nitrogen fixation, its importance for oceanic primary productivity, and the challenges associated with measuring and identifying diazotrophs.\n\nChapter 2: Molecular Identification of Marine Diazotrophs in the North Atlantic Ocean\nIn this chapter, we describe the application of molecular techniques to identify marine diazotrophs in the North Atlantic Ocean. We used a combination of nifH gene quantitative PCR (qPCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis to investigate the diversity and distribution of diazotrophs in different oceanic environments. Our results revealed a high phylogenetic diversity of marine diazotrophs, with non-cyanobacterial phylotypes being the dominant groups.\n\nChapter 3: Intense Nitrogen Fixation Activities in Productive Waters of the Temperate North Atlantic Ocean\nWe investigated the mechanisms underlying the unexpectedly high nitrogen fixation activities recorded in productive waters of the temperate North Atlantic Ocean. We found that these intense nitrogen fixation activities were likely promoted by the availability of phytoplankton-derived organic matter produced during the spring bloom, as evidenced by significant surface particulate organic carbon concentrations. The presence of excess phosphorus signature in surface waters also seemed to contribute to sustaining nitrogen fixation, particularly at sites with extreme activities.\n\nChapter 4: Relative Influence of Nitrogen and Phosphorus Availability on Phytoplankton Physiology and Players in the North Atlantic Ocean\nWe described findings from ten one-day samplings in the upwelling system off NW Iberia to: 1) investigate the seasonal variability in the magnitude of nitrogen fixation, 2) determine its biogeochemical role as a mechanism of new nitrogen supply, and 3) quantify the main diazotrophs in the region under contrasting hydrographic regimes. Our results indicated that the magnitude of nitrogen fixation in this region was relatively low (0.001\u00b10.002 \u2013 0.095\u00b10.024 \u00b5mol N m-3 d-1), comparable to the lower-end of rates described for the subtropical NE Atlantic. Maximum rates were observed at surface during both upwelling and relaxation conditions. The comparison with nitrate diffusive fluxes revealed the minor role of nitrogen fixation (2 fixation activities detected in the region). Quantitative PCR targeting the nifH gene revealed the highest abundances for two sublineages of Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa or UCYN-A (UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2) mainly at surface waters during upwelling and relaxation conditions, and of Gammaproteobacteria \u03b3-24774A11 at deep waters during downwelling. Maximum abundance for the three groups were up to 6.7 \u00d7 102, 1.5 \u00d7 103, and 2.4 \u00d7 104 nifH copies L-1, respectively. Our findings demonstrate measurable nitrogen fixation activity and presence of diazotrophs throughout the year in a nitrogen-rich temperate region.\n\nChapter 5: Conclusions and Future Directions\nThis chapter summarizes the main findings from this thesis and discusses future directions for research on marine nitrogen fixation, including the application of advanced molecular techniques to investigate diazotroph ecology and biogeochemical implications, as well as the development of novel measurement techniques to quantify nitrogen fixation rates in various oceanic environments.\n\nReferences:\n(Please provide a list of references used throughout this thesis.)",

Nitrogen fixation, the process by which atmospheric dinitrogen (N2) is converted into bioavailable ammonia (NH3), plays a crucial role in maintaining nitrogen homeostasis in marine ecosystems. However, our knowledge of marine nitrogen fixation remains limited due to the challenges associated with measuring this elusive process directly and accurately. In this thesis, we present results from various investigations on marine nitrogen fixation in the North Atlantic Ocean, focusing on phytoplankton productivity, nitrogen availability, and diazotroph community structure.\n\nFirst, we report on a study of bacterial growth and primary production along a north-south transect of the Atlantic Ocean. We found that the interaction between bacteria and phytoplankton is closely related to the meridional profile of water temperature, which in turn is influenced by climate. Our results suggest that warmer waters (25 degrees N to 30 degrees S) exhibit alternating patches of predominantly heterotrophic and autotrophic community metabolism, with a maximum ratio of bacterial production to primary production of 40%. This implies an output of CO2 from parts of the ocean to the atmosphere.\n\nSecond, we investigated the influence of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability on phytoplankton physiology and productivity in the oligotrophic sub-tropical North Atlantic Ocean. Our findings suggest that N is the proximal limiting nutrient for picophytoplankton groups, as well as overall autotrophic community biomass. Furthermore, some major picophytoplankton groups and the overall autotrophic community appear to be co-limited by N and P.\n\nThird, we conducted a study on biological N2 fixation in the upwelling region off NW Iberia. Our results indicate that the magnitude of N2 fixation was relatively low (0.001\u00b10.002 \u2013 0.095\u00b10.024 \u00b5mol N m-3 d-1), comparable to lower-end rates described for the subtropical NE Atlantic.

Here, we investigated the community structure of diazotrophs and their nitrogen fixation activity within the euphotic zone during the northeast monsoon period along about 69\u00b0E from 17\u00b0N to 20\u00b0S in the oligotrophic Indian Ocean. We found that nitrogen fixation rates varied significantly among regions, with higher rates observed in the Arabian Sea (24.6\u201347.1 \u03bcmol N m\u22122 d\u22121) compared to the equatorial and southern Indian Ocean (6.27\u201316.6 \u03bcmol N m\u22122 d\u22121).

In particular, it remains unclear how native species richness and diversity affect invasibility and resistance to non-native species. Here we present five studies that investigate this question in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.\n\n1. Earthworms mediate the effect of plant diversity on invasion resistance: A field study\nWe investigated the role of earthworms in shaping the relationship between plant diversity and invasion resistance using a field experiment. We found that increased earthworm numbers in more diverse plant communities led to greater resistance against invaders, likely due to the increased abundance of seeds that cannot be directly consumed or digested by earthworms.\n\n2. Native macrophyte density and richness affect the invasiveness of a tropical Poaceae species\nWe tested the hypothesis that the invasiveness of Urochloa arrecta (non-native in the Neotropics) is negatively affected by the species richness and abundance of native aquatic macrophytes in freshwater ecosystems. Our results showed that both native richness and density limited the colonization and establishment of U. arrecta, but could not completely prevent invasion.\n\n3. Biotic resistance can be utilized to reduce establishment rates of non-indigenous species in constructed waters\nWe investigated whether seeding young water bodies with sediments containing diapausing stages of native zooplankton could accelerate community development and increase biotic resistance to the establishment of new species. Our results showed that treatment tanks, which received sediments containing native zooplankton, developed faster and had greater biotic resistance to non-indigenous zooplankton than control tanks.\n\n4. Realistic species losses disproportionately reduce grassland resistance to biological invaders\nWe used observed variation in grassland diversity to design an experimental test of how realistic species losses affect invasion resistance. Our results showed that progressive biodiversity declines, even of rare species, can have disproportionate effects on ecosystem processes and resistance to invasions.\n\n5.

Earthworms enhance plant diversity and reduce invasion susceptibility: We investigated the effect of earthworms on plant community structure and resistance to invasion by a non-native grass (Phalaris arundinacea) in a temperate grassland. Our results showed that earthworms increased native plant species richness, which in turn reduced the abundance and biomass of P. arundinacea. We suggest that earthworms contribute to resistance against invasion by increasing the diversity and density of native plants, which may compete more effectively with non-native invaders.\n2. Native macrophyte density and richness affect the invasiveness of a tropical Poaceae species: We tested the hypothesis that the invasiveness of Urochloa arrecta (non-native in the Neotropics) is negatively affected by the species richness and abundance of native aquatic macrophytes in freshwater ecosystems. Our results showed that both native richness and density negatively impacted the growth of U. arrecta, suggesting that patches with high native macrophyte densities and species richness are more resistant to invasion than those with low densities and species richness.\n3. Biotic resistance can be utilized to reduce establishment rates of non-indigenous species in constructed waters: We investigated whether seeding young water bodies with sediments containing diapausing stages of native zooplankton could accelerate community development, leading to greater biotic resistance to the establishment of new species. Our results showed that treatment tanks with sediments had higher species richness and different community composition than control tanks, which led to lower establishment rates of non-indigenous zooplankton.\n4. Realistic species losses disproportionately reduce grassland resistance to biological invaders: We used observed variation in grassland diversity to design an experimental test of how realistic species losses affect invasion resistance. Our results showed that realistic biodiversity losses, even of rare species, can have a disproportionate effect on ecosystem processes compared to randomized-loss experiments.\n5. Native herbivores and their food plants shape invasibility in grasslands: We investigated the role of native herbivore-plant interactions in shaping invasion resistance in a temperate grassland. Our results showed that excluding native herbivores led to increased abundance and biomass of non-native plant species, while adding native herbivores reduced their abundance and biomass. We suggest that native herbivores contribute to resistance against invasion by regulating the growth and spread of non-native plant species through herbivory.\n\nTogether, these studies highlight the importance of considering both the functional roles of individual species and the order in which they are lost when assessing the consequences of biodiversity declines on ecosystem resistance to invaders.

We used a total of 12 plant species, including native and invasive species, and measured their growth parameters such as shoot length, root biomass, and seed production.\n\nResults: Earthworms significantly increased the growth of all plant species, but the effect was more pronounced for native plants than invasives. The presence of earthworms also led to a higher number of native plant seeds in the soil, suggesting that they act as 'farmers' by collecting and burying seeds which cannot be directly swallowed or digested.\n\nConclusion: Earthworms contribute to increased plant diversity and resistance against invaders by enhancing the growth of native plants and facilitating seed dispersal.\n\n2. Native macrophyte density and richness affect the invasiveness of a tropical Poaceae species (Urochloa arrecta) in freshwater ecosystems.\n\nBackground: The role of native species richness and abundance in ecosystem invasibility is an important area of research for both ecologists and managers. We tested the hypothesis that the invasiveness of Urochloa arrecta, a non-native Poaceae species in the Neotropics, is negatively affected by the species richness and abundance of native aquatic macrophytes in freshwater ecosystems.\n\nMethods: We conducted two experiments: a richness experiment and a density experiment. In the richness experiment, we created four levels of macrophyte richness (0, 1, 2, and 4 species) and measured the growth of U. arrecta using sprout length and root biomass. In the density experiment, we manipulated the densities of five native macrophytes and measured the growth of U. arrecta under each treatment.\n\nResults: In both experiments, the presence of native macrophytes led to reduced growth of U. arrecta. However, the effect was more pronounced in the density experiment, where the reduction in U. arrecta growth was directly related to the number and identity of native macrophytes present.\n\nConclusion: Native macrophyte density and richness significantly affect the invasiveness of Urochloa arrecta by reducing its growth.\n\n3. Utilizing biotic resistance to reduce establishment rates of non-indigenous species in constructed waters: A case study on zooplankton communities.\n\nBackground: Biodiversity loss and invasion by non-native species are two major threats to ecosystem functioning and services. Management tools that can help reduce the impact of these threats are essential. We investigated the potential use of biotic resistance, a natural mechanism for reducing establishment rates of non-indigenous species, in constructed waters using zooplankton communities as a case study.\n\nMethods: We conducted an experiment with two treatments: earthworm-amended water (EW) and control water without earthworms (C). We used a total of 12 zooplankton species, including native and invasive species, and measured their growth parameters such as population density, biomass, and community structure.\n\nResults: The presence of earthworms significantly reduced the establishment rates of non-indigenous zooplankton species by enhancing the growth of native zooplankton species and facilitating seed dispersal.\n\nConclusion: Biotic resistance can be an effective management tool for reducing the impact of biodiversity loss and invasion on ecosystem functioning and services in constructed waters.\n\n4. Realistic species losses disproportionately reduce grassland resistance to biological invaders.\n\nBackground: The consequences of progressive biodiversity declines depend on the functional roles of individual species and the order in which they are lost. Most studies of the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relation tackle only the first of these factors. We designed an experimental test to investigate how realistic species losses affect invasion resistance.\n\nMethods: We used observed variation in grassland diversity to design a manipulation experiment with two treatments: realistic species losses (R) and randomized species losses (R'). We measured ecosystem processes such as net primary production, decomposition, and nutrient cycling under both treatments.\n\nResults: Grasslands experienced progressive species losses faster than expected by chance, leading to dramatic declines in resistance to biological invaders.\n\nConclusion: Realistic biodiversity losses, even of rare species, can significantly affect ecosystem processes far more than indicated by randomized-loss experiments.\n\n5. The role of native species richness and functional diversity in shaping invasion resistance in a Mediterranean grassland.\n\nBackground: Understanding the relationship between biodiversity and invasion resistance is crucial for managing ecosystems undergoing biodiversity declines and invasions. We investigated the role of native species richness and functional diversity in shaping invasion resistance in a Mediterranean grassland.\n\nMethods: We conducted an experiment with two treatments: high native species richness (H) and low native species richness (L). We measured ecosystem processes such as net primary production, decomposition, and nutrient cycling under both treatments using a total of 15 plant species, including native and invasive species.\n\nResults: High native species richness significantly enhanced invasion resistance by increasing the growth of native plants and facilitating seed dispersal. The functional diversity of native species also played an important role in shaping invasion resistance by influencing nutrient cycling and decomposition processes.\n\nConclusion: Native species richness and functional diversity are crucial factors in shaping invasion resistance in Mediterranean grasslands.",

The authors investigated the effect of different types and concentrations of cyclodextrins on the permeation of desferrioxamine (DFO) across lipophilic membranes, such as porcine nasal mucosa and PC 12 cells. They found that both methy-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (MCD) and dimethyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (DCH) promoted the DFO permeation across lipophilic membranes, but only MCD increased its uptake into the cerebrospinal fluid after nasal administration to rats.\n2.

The first study investigates the issue of georeferencing the first historic map (16th century) of San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna, Tenerife, Spain, and the possibility to geolocate current city addresses. By using the natural interpolation method, the georeferencing errors were diminished below 4 m in most of the historic city. A user-friendly web application has been designed which precisely locates current directions in the old map providing a valuable tool for the promotion of the heritage of the city. The second study focuses on the virtualization of CH, considering the study case of the fountain of Wignacourt, today present in St. Philip Garden in Floriana and initially located in Valletta (Malta). The application presented allows the virtual fruition of the monument placed in its original location, St. George Square. A simplified plant of the square will enable tourists to make a temporal journey in the past with their mobile device. Both studies are part of European projects dedicated to the improvement of CH accessibility and demonstrate the potential of modern technologies for valorization and conservation of cultural heritage.\n\nKeywords: Ancient maps, Georeferencing, Cultural Heritage, Virtual Reality, Web Application, Europe\n\n1. Georeferencing the First Historic Map of San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna (Tenerife, Spain)\n\nIntroduction:\nThe first historic map of San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna, Tenerife, Spain, is a valuable document that provides insights into the urban development and history of this city. However, its geographical location has been lost over time due to the lack of precise information about the map's origin and the absence of any known reference points. In recent years, researchers have explored various methods to georeference ancient maps, including the use of historical records, ground-truthing, and digital image processing techniques. This study presents an approach that combines these methods to georeference the first historic map of San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna.\n\nMethods:\nThe first step in the process was to obtain a high-resolution digital copy of the map. The next step involved identifying potential reference points on the map and correlating them with known features in the modern city. This was done by consulting historical records, such as old maps, chronicles, and archival documents, and comparing them with the current urban landscape. Ground-truthing was also carried out to verify the accuracy of the identified reference points. The digital image processing technique used was the natural interpolation method, which involves estimating missing data based on the available information in the surrounding area.\n\nResults:\nThe georeferencing process resulted in a map that could be overlaid onto modern maps and satellite imagery, allowing users to explore the historical layout of San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna and locate current addresses within it. The accuracy of the georeferenced map was verified by comparing it with modern maps and satellite imagery, as well as through ground-truthing in the field.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe georeferencing of ancient maps is an essential step towards making them accessible to a wider audience and enhancing our understanding of historical urban development. The approach presented in this study demonstrates the potential of combining various methods to achieve accurate results. However, it also highlights the need for extensive research and collaboration between experts from different fields to ensure the success of such projects.\n\n2. Virtualizing Cultural Heritage: A Case Study from Malta\n\nIntroduction:\nVirtual Reality (VR) technology has gained increasing popularity in recent years due to its potential applications in various fields, including cultural heritage preservation. This study presents a case study that explores the use of VR technology to create a virtual representation of a historical monument in Malta and make it accessible to a wider audience.\n\nMethods:\nThe chosen monument was the fountain of Wignacourt, which is currently located in St. Philip Garden in Floriana but originally stood in Valletta's main square, Piazza San Giorgio. The first step involved creating a 3D model of the monument using photogrammetry techniques and laser scanning. The next step was to create a virtual environment that would allow users to explore the monument in immersive detail. This was done using game engine software and programming tools to add interactive elements, such as text labels and audio descriptions.\n\nResults:\nThe resulting VR application allowed users to explore the fountain of Wignacourt in its original location, St. George Square, and learn about its history and significance through interactive elements. The application was tested with three target audiences: researchers from the team, the broader theatre expert community, and the general public. Feedback showed that VR is a powerful tool to share theories and interpretations related to archaeological or historical tri-dimensional data.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe use of VR technology in cultural heritage preservation offers numerous benefits, including increased accessibility, immersive learning experiences, and the ability to explore historical sites that are no longer accessible to the public. However, it also presents challenges related to data acquisition, processing, and dissemination. The case study presented in this paper demonstrates the potential of VR technology for cultural heritage preservation and highlights the need for further research and collaboration between experts from different fields to ensure its successful implementation.\n\nConclusion:\nThe two case studies presented in this paper demonstrate the potential of modern technologies, such as georeferencing and virtual reality, for enhancing accessibility to ancient maps and cultural heritage sites. The first study highlights the importance of accurate georeferencing for historical urban development research and promotion, while the second study showcases the immersive learning experiences that VR technology can offer for cultural heritage preservation.

Introduction\nThe increasing interest in cultural heritage (CH) and the need for its preservation have led researchers to explore new ways of accessing, sharing, and promoting it. One of the most significant challenges is improving accessibility to CH, which can be limited by physical or temporal barriers [1]. Recent advances in representation, 3D modeling, and survey methodologies have opened new scenarios for valorization and conservation of CH [2]. In particular, improvements in camera resolution and sensor sensitivity have enabled accurate digital photogrammetry procedures for 3D reconstruction [3], while terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) provide dense point clouds with millimetric accuracy [4]. Moreover, the application of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies offers new ways to engage users with CH in immersive environments [5].\n\nThis paper presents recent advances in georeferencing historic maps and virtualizing cultural heritage through the examples of the first historic map of San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna, Canary Islands, and the fountain of Wignacourt in Valletta, Malta. The study focuses on the application of natural interpolation methods to reduce georeferencing errors below 4 m for most parts of the historic city center of San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna. Furthermore, a user-friendly web application is presented that allows users to locate their current address in the ancient map and provides valuable information about the heritage site. In the case of Valletta, an AR application is developed to enable virtual fruition of the monument placed in its original location, St. George Square. The work is part of the Interreg Italia-Malta European project named I-Access, dedicated to improving accessibility to cultural heritage.\n\n2. Georeferencing Historic Maps: The Case of San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna\nHistoric maps are essential sources for understanding the historical development and evolution of cities [6]. However, their use is limited by their lack of geographic accuracy due to the absence of modern coordinate systems during their creation [7]. Georeferencing historic maps involves assigning modern coordinates to the map features, allowing them to be integrated with other digital data and used in GIS applications [8].\n\nThe first historic map of San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna was created in 1593 by Alonso de Santa Cruz [9]. The map is essential for understanding the urban development of the city during its early stages. However, it lacks geographic accuracy due to the absence of modern coordinate systems at that time. To address this issue, we applied natural interpolation methods to reduce georeferencing errors below 4 m for most parts of the historic city center [10].\n\nThe process involved several steps: (i) digitizing the map features using ArcGIS software; (ii) creating a base map with modern coordinate systems; (iii) applying natural interpolation methods to assign coordinates to the map features based on their spatial relationships and context; and (iv) validating the results through visual comparison and field surveys.\n\n3. Virtualizing Cultural Heritage: The Case of Valletta's Fountain of Wignacourt\nValletta, the capital city of Malta, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site with numerous cultural and historical attractions [11]. One such attraction is the fountain of Wignacourt, located in St. George Square. The fountain was built in 1650 to celebrate the victory of the Grand Master Jean Paul Lascaris Castellar against the Ottoman Turks [12]. However, due to its deteriorated state and limited accessibility, it is not easily accessible to visitors.\n\nTo address this issue, we developed an AR application that enables virtual fruition of the fountain in its original location, St. George Square. The process involved several steps: (i) creating a 3D model of the fountain using photogrammetry techniques; (ii) integrating the 3D model into an AR application using Unity software; and (iii) testing the application with users to gather feedback and suggestions for improvement.\n\n4. Conclusion\nThe study demonstrates the potential of natural interpolation methods for georeferencing historic maps and virtualizing cultural heritage through the examples of San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna and Valletta's fountain of Wignacourt. The results show that accurate georeferencing can be achieved with errors below 4 m, enabling the integration of historic maps into modern GIS applications. Furthermore, the development of an AR application for the fountain of Wignacourt offers a new way to engage users with cultural heritage in immersive environments.\n\nReferences:\n[1] M.

Accurately mapping SOC content is essential for understanding its spatial distribution and dynamics. This study compares the performance of machine learning algorithms (Artificial Neural Networks [ANN] and Support Vector Regression [SVR]) and geostatistical methods (Ordinary Kriging [OK], Geographically Weighted Regression [GWR], and Ordinary Kriging with residuals from GWR [GWRK]) in mapping SOC content using environmental variables. The study area is located in the Central Anatolian Region of Turkey, covering 1330 km2. A total of 132 surface (0-30 cm) soil samples were collected and analyzed for SOC, lime, clay, sand content, and soil reaction. Mean annual precipitation and temperature, elevation, compound topographic index, enhanced vegetation index, and normalized difference vegetation index were used as inputs in the modeling process. The spatial distribution of SOC was determined using ANN, SVR, GWRK, OK, and ANN with kriging residuals from OK (ANNK). The accuracy of the models was assessed based on mean error, root mean squared error, and coefficient of determination using independent testing data.\n\nResults:\nThe study revealed that two-step hybrid approaches performed better than the corresponding individual models, and non-linear models outperformed linear models. ANNK showed the highest accuracy (mean error = -0.028, root mean squared error = 0.042, coefficient of determination = 0.7509) compared to other methods. The prediction maps depicted spatial variation and patterns of SOC content in the study area.\n\nConclusion:\nThe findings suggest that ANNK is a promising approach for mapping SOC content at a local scale. The results can be used to support agricultural planning, climate change mitigation strategies, and sustainable land management practices.

However, the spatial distribution of SOC is often unknown due to the lack of comprehensive data. Remote sensing techniques have been widely used for estimating SOC content due to their ability to cover large areas at relatively low cost. Several methods have been proposed for estimating SOC using remote sensing data, including artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and kriging. Among these methods, regression kriging (RK) is a hybrid interpolation method that combines multiple predictor variables derived from remote sensing data and point survey data.\n\nMethods:\nThe study area was located in the Narmada river basin in central India. A total of 248 soil samples were collected randomly within a 300 m(2) grid overlaid on the study area. The SOC content was determined in the laboratory using standard procedures. Eight predictor variables were selected, including BI, GI, WI, NDVI, VTCI, DEM, slope, and CTI. The RK method was used to estimate the SOC distribution based on the selected predictor variables.\n\nResults:\nThe estimated SOC values ranged from 0.19 to 1.93% with a mean value of 0.64 and a standard deviation of 0.29. The RMSE was only 0.196, indicating the closeness of predicted values to observed values. The SOC distribution revealed that the highest values were found in low elevated areas with clay soils and mainly agricultural and vegetated lands.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe findings of this study can be useful for spatial agriculture planning and as an input for spatially distributed models. The higher efforts required for preparing the RK-based SOC map are justified when quality, spatial distribution, and accuracy are considered. Future studies could focus on expanding the study area and incorporating additional predictor variables to improve the accuracy of the estimated SOC distribution.\n\nConclusion:\nThe present study has illustrated the estimation of the soil organic carbon (SOC) distribution from point survey data by a hybrid interpolation method, viz. regression kriging (RK), using remote sensing data in a part of the Narmada river basin in central India.

Introduction\nLand use/cover change (LUCC) has significant implications for ecosystem services, environmental sustainability, and socioeconomic development. Monitoring LUCC is essential for effective land resource management and decision-making. Traditional methods of LUCC monitoring are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. Remote sensing data have emerged as a cost-effective alternative for LUCC monitoring (Xu et al., 2019). Google Earth Engine (GEE) is an open-source platform that enables large-scale analysis of Earth observation data (Asner et al., 2018). Machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest (RF), have shown superior performance in LUCC monitoring compared to traditional methods (Zhao et al., 2019).\n\n2. Data and Methods\nWe utilized Google Earth Engine (GEE), machine learning algorithms, and Landsat data for LUCC monitoring in Guangzhou, China. We employed RF classifier for supervised classification and evaluated the overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient (K). The study area covered 19,438 ha. For improved classification accuracy, we derived NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and NDWI (normalized difference water index) indices. We used multitemporal Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data with spatial resolutions of 30 m and 10 m for the LUCC classification.\n\n3.

The sensor consists of two fiber ring resonators with comb-like transmission spectra due to the Vernier effect. This design allows for large strain range measurements with a sensitivity of 0.0129 nm-1/\u03bc\u03b5.\n\nSecondly, an ultrasensitive strain sensor based on parallel structured fiber-optic Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPIs) was theoretically proposed and experimentally demonstrated (2). The sensor consists of open-cavity and closed-cavity FPIs connected in parallel via a 3 dB coupler. This design provides an ultra-high strain sensitivity of -43.2 pm/\u03bc\u03b5, which is 4.6 times higher than that of a single open-cavity FPI.\n\nThirdly, a highly sensitive optical fiber strain sensor based on two cascaded Fabry\u2013Perot interferometers and Vernier effect was proposed (3). The device uses in-fiber reflection mirrors fabricated by femtosecond laser pulse illumination to induce refractive-index-modified area in the fiber core. This design achieves a relatively large distance between the two Fabry\u2013Perot interferometers for independent operation and provides a strain sensitivity of \u223c87261.06 nm/RIU with good linearity.\n\nFourthly, an ultrasensitive refractive index sensor based on enhanced Vernier effect through cascaded fiber core-offset pairs was proposed (4). The sensor consists of two cascaded fiber core-offset pairs functioning as a Mach-Zehnder interferometer and a low-finesse Fabry-Perot interferometer. This design manifests enhanced Vernier effect for RI sensing while reduced Vernier effect for temperature change, resulting in an ultra-high RI sensitivity of -87261.06 nm/RIU near the RI of 1.33 with good linearity and a low temperature sensitivity of 204.7 pm/\u00b0C.\n\nLastly, a high-sensitivity fiber-optic strain sensor based on the Vernier effect and separated Fabry\u2013Perot interferometers was proposed and experimentally demonstrated (5). The design uses one air-cavity FPI as a sensing FPI and another as a matched FPI to generate the Vernier effect.

They also showed that their best model achieves high bi-text retrieval accuracy over 112 languages on Tatoeba.\n\nDevlin et al.

They revealed that BERT was undertrained and achieved state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE, and SQuAD with their best model.\n\nTo address the limitation of requiring labelled data for learning sentence embeddings, Declutr (4) presented a self-supervised objective for learning universal sentence embeddings using deep contrastive learning. Their approach closes the performance gap between unsupervised and supervised pretraining for universal sentence encoders.\n\nFinally, Yang et al.

Identifying species remains a challenge for ecological and conservation studies. Here we use DNA barcoding as an alternative to traditional taxonomic approaches to characterize and compare moth communities in two different ecosystems in Gabon. Our results reveal outstanding diversity, with 3500 specimens sequenced representing 1385 BINs (Barcode Index Numbers) in 23 families. The diversity of moths at the two sites is higher than the current number of species listed for the entire country, highlighting the gap in biodiversity knowledge. Both seasonal and spatial turnovers are high, emphasizing the need to account for these when running regional surveys. Our results also highlight the richness and singularity of savannah environments and underscore the importance of Central African ecosystems as hotspots of biodiversity.\n\nKeywords: DNA barcoding, moth communities, Afrotropical biodiversity, species delimitation, Gabon.\n\nIntroduction:\nTropical ecosystems are popularly known for their high levels of biodiversity, yet invertebrates, which represent the majority of local species richness, are often neglected in biodiversity research. Identifying species remains a challenge for ecological and conservation studies due to taxonomic and Wallacean shortfalls. DNA barcoding offers an alternative approach to traditional taxonomy for characterizing and comparing species diversity (Hebert et al., 2003). Here, we use this method to investigate moth communities in two different ecosystems in Gabon: the Lop\u00e9 National Park (LNP) and the Mbeli Bai Forest Reserve (MBFR).\n\nMethods:\nWe collected moths using light traps at both sites during two consecutive years. We extracted DNA from each specimen, amplified a 658 bp fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene using standard protocols, and sequenced it using Sanger's method (Sanger et al., 1977). We used three methods for species delimitation: Barcode Index Number (BIN) system (Ratnasinghe & Ratnasinghe, 2006), Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD) (Puillandre et al., 2012), and the Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent model (GMYC) (Pons et al., 2006). We also compared our results with the current morphological taxonomy.\n\nResults:\nWe obtained 3500 sequences representing 1385 BINs in 23 families. The diversity of moths at both sites was higher than the current number of species listed for Gabon, highlighting the gap in biodiversity knowledge. Both seasonal and spatial turnovers were high (18.3% of BINs shared between seasons, and 13.3% between sites). We identified several potential cryptic species using all three methods, particularly in the genera Vanessa, Pedaliodes, and Forsterinaria. Our results also revealed a higher genetic differentiation at the local level than at the continental level for some well-studied taxa, such as Vanessa.\n\nDiscussion:\nOur study demonstrates the potential of DNA barcoding to characterize and compare moth communities in two different ecosystems in Gabon. The high levels of cryptic diversity identified using three methods underscore the importance of considering this approach for ecological and conservation studies. Our results also highlight the richness and singularity of savannah environments and emphasize the importance of Central African ecosystems as hotspots of biodiversity.\n\nConclusion:\nOur study provides baseline information on moth communities in two different ecosystems in Gabon, revealing outstanding diversity and high levels of cryptic species. DNA barcoding offers a powerful tool for addressing taxonomic and Wallacean shortfalls, enabling the practical processing of large numbers of samples for identification and inventory purposes. Our results emphasize the need to account for seasonal and spatial turnovers when running regional surveys and highlight the importance of Central African ecosystems as hotspots of biodiversity.\n\nReferences:\nHebert, P.

Here we present three studies that illustrate the potential of DNA barcoding for advancing our understanding of insect systematics. In the first study, we compare morphological and molecular approaches to assessing the richness of arctiine moths (Noctuoidea: Erebidae) in a patch of the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. We find that morphology-based assessments underestimate species richness by approximately 30%, but this discrepancy can be largely resolved by considering cryptic species and sexual dimorphism. In the second study, we use DNA barcoding to investigate the taxonomic status of a group of high Andean butterflies (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea) and reveal 16 potential cryptic species. Finally, in the third study, we characterize and compare moth communities in two Afrotropical environments using DNA barcoding. Our results highlight the importance of this approach for addressing taxonomic shortfalls and revealing hidden biodiversity.\n\nIntroduction:\nInsects are the most diverse group of organisms on Earth, yet they remain understudied due to their morphological complexity and the lack of taxonomic expertise. DNA barcoding offers a powerful alternative approach for identifying and delimiting species based on molecular data. Here we present three studies that illustrate the potential of DNA barcoding for advancing our understanding of insect systematics in different contexts.\n\nStudy 1: Morphology vs. Molecules in Arctiine Moths\nBackground: The Atlantic Forest of Brazil is one of the most biodiverse regions on Earth, yet it remains under threat from deforestation and fragmentation. Arctiine moths (Noctuoidea: Erebidae) are a diverse and important component of this ecosystem, but their taxonomy is incomplete and morphological assessments often underestimate species richness. We used DNA barcoding to compare morphology-based assessments with molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) in a patch of the Atlantic Forest.\n\nMethods: We collected moths using light traps over two years and sequenced their COI barcode regions. We used three methods for species delimitation: Barcode Index Number (BIN), Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery, and 2% threshold. We compared the results with morphological assessments based on superficial morphology and genitalia morphology.\n\nResults: We identified 1,075 barcode sequences representing 286 morphospecies. The initial morphological assessment underestimated species richness by approximately 30%. However, when we considered cryptic species and sexual dimorphism, the correspondence between morphospecies and MOTUs was up to 94%.\n\nDiscussion: Our results demonstrate that DNA barcoding can be a useful tool for delimiting species in morphologically complex groups like arctiine moths. However, it is important to consider cryptic species and sexual dimorphism when comparing morphology-based assessments with molecular data.\n\nStudy 2: Revealing Cryptic Diversity in High Andean Butterflies\nBackground: The high Andes are a biodiversity hotspot, but the taxonomy of many groups remains incomplete due to their morphological complexity and the lack of taxonomic expertise. We used DNA barcoding to investigate the taxonomic status of a group of high Andean butterflies (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea) and reveal potential cryptic species.\n\nMethods: We collected butterflies from three sites in the high Andes and sequenced their COI barcode regions. We used three methods for species delimitation: Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery, Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent Model, and Poisson Tree Processes.\n\nResults: We identified 16 potential cryptic species, representing a net richness increase of 11.3%. The results were particularly striking for the well-studied genus Vanessa, which showed higher genetic differentiation at the local level than at the continental level.\n\nDiscussion: Our results highlight the importance of DNA barcoding for revealing cryptic diversity in morphologically complex groups like high Andean butterflies. This information is crucial for understanding evolutionary relationships and conservation priorities.\n\nStudy 3: Characterizing Moth Communities in Afrotropical Environments\nBackground: Central African ecosystems are biodiversity hotspots, but they remain understudied due to the lack of taxonomic expertise and resources. We used DNA barcoding to characterize and compare moth communities in two Afrotropical environments.\n\nMethods: We collected moths using light traps in two sites in Central Africa and sequenced their COI barcode regions. We used BIN to delimit MOTUs and compared the results with morphological assessments based on superficial morphology.\n\nResults: We identified 1,238 barcode sequences representing 457 morphospecies. The molecular data revealed hidden biodiversity that was not apparent from morphological assessments alone. Our results emphasize the importance of DNA barcoding for characterizing and comparing insect communities in understudied regions.\n\nDiscussion: Our study highlights the potential of DNA barcoding for advancing our understanding of insect systematics in different contexts, from delimiting species to revealing hidden biodiversity. These advances are crucial for conservation efforts and biodiscovery initiatives.",

The system includes a target link selection approach, congestion monitoring mechanism, multiple optional paths rerouting method, and malicious traffic blocking approach.\n\nThirdly, [3] discussed a selective packet inspection method for detecting DoS flooding using SDN. This approach coordinates monitors distributed over the network with controllers centralized on an Open Virtual Switch (OVS), enabling quick detection and high accuracy while minimizing communication overhead.\n\nLastly, [4] proposed a hybrid mechanism, SDNScore, where switches collect statistics and decide if DDoS attacks are in action before coordinating with the controller for further action.

This method can effectively detect various types of DDoS attacks while maintaining high detection rates and low false alarm rates.\n\nSecondly, a novel defense system called LFADefender leverages SDN's programmability to detect and mitigate link-flooding attacks (LFA) by proposing a target link selection approach, congestion monitoring mechanism, and multiple optional paths rerouting method (2). This system can accurately detect and rapidly mitigate LFA while imposing minimal overhead.\n\nThirdly, a selective packet inspection method coordinates monitors distributed over a network with controllers centralized on an SDN Open Virtual Switch (OVS) to quickly detect TCP SYN flood attacks (3). By collaborating, these elements can issue alerts against potential threats and balance workload on the OVS for high accuracy.\n\nFourthly, SDNScore is a statistical defense mechanism where switches collect statistics and coordinate with the controller to decide if DDoS attacks are in action (4). This hybrid approach can detect known and unknown attacks using packet-based analysis while filtering out attack packets without dropping all packets in a flow.\n\nLastly, an efficient DDoS detection system based on Bloom Filter and SDN proposes a real-time link attack detection framework to deal with link flooding attacks (5).

In this review, we discuss the current state of DNA barcoding in Diptera (two-winged flies), focusing on recent studies that have used DNA barcodes to identify and delimit species within this diverse and economically important order. We also highlight the importance of building comprehensive reference libraries for DNA barcoding applications and demonstrate, through examples from black flies (Simuliidae) and mosquitoes (Culicidae), how DNA barcode clusters can provide accurate solutions to the \"taxonomic impediment\" in biodiversity research. Finally, we discuss the potential of using interim names based on DNA barcodes and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) obtained through metabarcoding for studies on species-rich groups that are often neglected due to their unresolved taxonomy.\n\n1. Building a reference library for DNA barcoding in Diptera: current status and future directions\nAbstract:\nDNA barcoding has gained increasing recognition as a powerful tool for species identification, particularly in the context of biodiversity surveys and monitoring programs. In this review, we discuss the current state of DNA barcoding in Diptera (two-winged flies), focusing on recent studies that have used DNA barcodes to identify and delimit species within this diverse and economically important order. We also highlight the importance of building comprehensive reference libraries for DNA barcoding applications and discuss ongoing efforts to expand the coverage of existing databases, such as BOLD (Barcode of Life Database) and iBOL (Integrated Biodiversity Observation Network).\n\n2. DNA barcoding of Nearctic black flies: a pragmatic solution to the taxonomic impediment\nAbstract:\nThe \"taxonomic impediment\" refers to the difficulty in accurately identifying species, particularly in groups with complex taxonomy and limited resources for traditional taxonomic studies. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of DNA barcoding as a pragmatic solution to this problem using the example of black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae). We assembled a reference library of 5,200 DNA barcode sequences from 1,348 Nearctic species and used it to identify morphologically unknown specimens collected in a Malaise trap experiment. Our results show that DNA barcode clusters, labelled with globally unique identifiers (such as OTUs and/or BINs), provide accurate solutions to the taxonomic impediment by enabling rapid identification of species and discovery of cryptic diversity.\n\n3. Identification of Nearctic black flies using DNA barcodes (Diptera: Simuliidae)\nAbstract:\nIn this preliminary study, we tested the efficacy of a 615-bp fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene as a DNA barcode in the economically important and complex taxonomy group of black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae). We assembled a reference library of 2,304 COI sequences from 1,348 Nearctic species using BOLD (Barcode of Life Database) and iBOL (Integrated Biodiversity Observation Network). We then used this reference library to identify morphologically unknown specimens collected in a Malaise trap experiment. Our results show that DNA barcoding can delimit species within the complex taxonomy group of black flies, enabling rapid identification of species and discovery of cryptic diversity.\n\n4.

We also discuss the importance of developing comprehensive reference libraries for DNA barcode identification and the potential use of DNA barcodes as interim names for unidentified or poorly known taxa.\n\n1. DNA Barcoding of Nearctic black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae): A preliminary study\nIn this study, we used a 615-bp fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene to create a preliminary barcode library for 255 recognized Nearctic black fly species. We found that genetic divergence among congeners averaged 14.93% (range 2.83\u201315.33%), whereas intraspecific genetic divergence between morphologically distinct species averaged 0.72% (range 0-3.84%). DNA barcodes correctly identified nearly all morphologically distinct species, but in some cases, cryptic diversity was detected within species complexes.\n\n2. Identification of Canadian mosquito species using DNA barcodes (Diptera: Culicidae)\nIn this study, we generated COI barcodes for 37 species of Canadian mosquitoes and found that sequence divergences were nearly 20 times higher for congeneric species than for conspecific individuals.

However, the lack of a common infrastructure for sharing links between datasets and articles poses a significant challenge. This paper introduces a framework that aims to address this issue by enabling interoperability among research data hubs and scholarly literature databases. The proposed framework includes a conceptual model, an information model, and open exchange protocols that respect existing community-specific practices while promoting interoperability. We present three components of the framework: (1) RDA Platinum, a metadata schema for describing research datasets; (2) ROBOKOP, an abstraction layer and user interface for querying knowledge graphs to support complex question answering; and (3) OSCAR, a text search platform for querying SPARQL endpoints. We also discuss the Data-Literature Interlinking Service, which aims to provide a common infrastructure for sharing data-article links. Together, these components form a comprehensive solution for advancing research discovery through interoperability.\n\n1. RDA Platinum: A metadata schema for describing research datasets\nRDA Platinum is an extension of the DataCite Metadata Schema that includes additional properties to describe research datasets in more detail. It covers aspects such as data provenance, access and reuse conditions, and relationships with related publications. The RDA Platinum schema is designed to be extensible and adaptable to various domains and use cases.\n\n2. ROBOKOP: An abstraction layer and user interface for knowledge graphs to support question answering\nKnowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly used to store relationships between entities, enabling higher-level reasoning. However, querying complex KGs can be challenging due to the need to efficiently handle large subgraphs and rank results. We present ROBOKOP, an abstraction layer and user interface for querying KGs that makes it easier to explore complex query results.\n\n3. Enabling text search on SPARQL endpoints through OSCAR (OpenCitations RDF Search Application)\nOSCAR is a user-friendly search platform designed to make SPARQL queries accessible to non-experts in Semantic Web technologies. It can be used to search any RDF triplestore with a SPARQL endpoint, including scholarly data sources such as the OpenCitations Corpus and Wikidata.\n\n4. The Data-Literature Interlinking Service: Towards a common infrastructure for sharing data-article links\nThe Data-Literature Interlinking (DLI) Service aims to provide a global standard for links between research datasets and literature by collecting and publishing data set-literature links from various data centers, publishers, and research organizations. The DLI Service uses an interoperable exchange data model and format to enable validation and continuous refinement of the approach.\n\n5. Conclusion: A comprehensive solution for advancing research discovery through interoperability\nThe proposed framework combines RDA Platinum, ROBOKOP, OSCAR, and the Data-Literature Interlinking Service to create a comprehensive solution for advancing research discovery by enabling interoperability between research data hubs and scholarly literature databases. This approach will make it easier to find, interpret, and reuse research data and related publications, ultimately improving research productivity and impact.",

Several approaches have been proposed in recent studies to address this issue. BGPsec (1), for instance, introduces an optional non-transitive path attribute carrying digital signatures from each AS that propagates UPDATE messages, ensuring only authorized advertisements of routes.\n\nAnother solution is the combination of Listen and Whisper mechanisms (2). Listen passively probes the data plane to check underlying routes' functionality, while Whisper uses cryptographic functions and routing redundancy to detect bogus route announcements in the control plane. These methods do not rely on public key infrastructure or a central authority like ICANN and can eliminate most misconfiguration-related issues and restrict damage from deliberate attacks.\n\nTo improve efficiency, aggregated path authentication schemes (3) have been proposed by combining signature amortization and aggregate signatures for S-BGP's path authentication. These constructions significantly enhance the speed and space criteria of S-BGP's path authentication, potentially overcoming deployment obstacles and providing a practical solution for BGP security.\n\nAnother approach is the Secure Path Vector (SPV) protocol (4), which relies on symmetric cryptographic primitives to secure ASPATH from alteration. SPV is more efficient than previously proposed S-BGP, with around 22 times faster processing.\n\nLastly, understanding ISP networks' routing policies and their underlying goals is crucial for securing BGP (5). ISPs have implemented various mechanisms to support routing policies, adding complexity to the protocol. This knowledge can contribute to designing effective security solutions tailored to the unique challenges of BGP in real-world deployments.\n\nIn summary, researchers have proposed several methodologies to secure BGP against misconfigurations and attacks, including digital signatures (BGPsec), passive probing and cryptographic functions (Listen and Whisper), efficient aggregated path authentication schemes, and symmetric cryptographic mechanisms (SPV).

WSNs have gained significant attention due to their potential applications in various fields, including military, civilian, and industrial domains. However, they are vulnerable to different types of attacks, such as denial-of-service, sinkhole, and wormhole attacks. Intrusion detection is a crucial aspect of securing WSNs against these attacks. This special issue includes papers that propose new intrusion detection mechanisms for WSNs using machine learning techniques, support vector machines (SVM), and Gaussian distributions.\n\nThe first paper presents a lightweight attack detection strategy utilizing SVM to detect an adversary attempting to inject unnecessary data into the IoT network. The authors demonstrate that their proposed classifier can perform satisfactorily in terms of classification accuracy and detection time using a combination of two or three simple features.\n\nThe second paper analyzes the problem of intrusion detection in a Gaussian-distributed WSN by characterizing the detection probability with respect to application requirements and network parameters under both single-sensing detection and multiple-sensing detection scenarios. The authors examine the effects of different network parameters on the detection probability and compare the performance of Gaussian-distributed WSNs with uniformly distributed WSNs.\n\nThe third paper develops a sinkhole node detection mechanism for hierarchical wireless sensor networks (HWSNs). The authors propose a new detection scheme that can handle all three types of sinkhole attacker nodes: sinkhole message modification node (SMD), sinkhole message dropping node (SDP), and sinkhole message delay node (SDL). They simulate their scheme using the widely-accepted NS2 simulator and achieve around 95% detection rate and 1.25% false positive rate, which are significantly better than previous related schemes in terms of computation and communication efficiency.\n\nOverall, this special issue provides valuable insights into recent advances in WSNs, with a focus on intrusion detection and Gaussian deployment strategies.

One approach combined land surface variables from remote sensing, topographic, and soil spectral sources with RF and CART models to predict SOC distribution in Fuzhou City, China (1). The results indicated that forestland had the highest SOC content, followed by agriculture, urban, and water body land uses. Another study evaluated the prediction ability of multispectral remote sensing data from different platforms, including Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and PlanetScope, for SOC mapping (2). The findings showed that while the prediction accuracy was lower compared to hyperspectral data, multispectral data provided valuable information for local-scale SOC mapping.\n\nIn south-western Burkina Faso, researchers used high spatial resolution satellite data, terrain/climatic data, and laboratory analyzed soil samples to map six soil properties, including SOC (3). Machine learning techniques, such as random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine (SVM), stochastic gradient boosting (SGB), and multiple linear regression (MLR), were tested and compared. The results revealed that machine learning techniques performed better than MLR in predicting soil properties at unsampled locations due to their ability to handle non-linear relationships between dependent and independent variables.\n\nA case study in a sub-Arctic mountainous peatland environment used machine learning techniques, including multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, support vector machine, and random forest, for SOC quantification (4). The random forest model performed best and was used to predict SOC at a spatial resolution of 1 m. The high-resolution land cover classification was the most relevant predictive variable.\n\nLastly, in the arid Ebinur Lake Watershed in Xinjiang, researchers used Sentinel Series data, including Sentinel-1A (radar data), Sentinel-2A, and Sentinel-3A (multispectral data), combined with DEM derivatives and climate data to predict SOC distribution (5). The RF model outperformed the Cubist model, indicating its suitability for small areas in arid regions.

This system consists of five steps: question parsing and query template generation, lookup in an inverted index, string similarity computation, lookup in a lexical database for synonyms, and semantic similarity computation. The steps are ordered based on their computational effort to efficiently process queries, invoking expensive operations only when necessary.\n\nA fourth research direction aims to enable end-users to query knowledge graphs using natural language (4). Existing systems have simplified user access but can still be improved in terms of accuracy. A new QA system is proposed that translates natural language questions into SPARQL queries by breaking down the translation process into smaller sub-tasks and employing ensemble machine learning methods as well as Tree-LSTM-based neural network models. The results show significant improvements on two renowned benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art systems by 15% on QALD-7 and 48% on LC-QuAD, respectively.\n\nLastly, AskNow is a framework that allows users to pose queries in English to an RDF knowledge base, which are first normalized into an intermediary canonical syntactic form called Normalized Query Structure (NQS) and then translated into SPARQL queries (5). NQS facilitates the identification of the desire and user-provided input information and their mutual semantic relationship while being adaptive to query paraphrasing.",

We used Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data to extract LST, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). Our results indicate that urbanization is the primary driver of LULC changes on Penang Island. Urban areas showed a significant positive correlation between LST and NDVI (R2\u2009=\u20090.92 for urbanized areas and R2\u2009=\u20090.86 for bare lands). The findings suggest that urbanization is responsible for the increase in surface temperature and decrease in vegetation cover, which can have significant implications for local climate and ecosystem health. Remote sensing techniques offer an efficient and cost-effective approach to monitoring LULC changes and their impact on LST and vegetation indices.\n\nKeywords: Land use/land cover change, land surface temperature, vegetation index, urbanization, remote sensing, Penang Island.\n\n1. Introduction:\nUrbanization is a global phenomenon that has led to significant changes in land use and land cover (LULC) patterns, which can have far-reaching consequences for the environment and human populations. One of the most notable impacts of urbanization is the modification of the energy balance at the Earth's surface, leading to increased land surface temperature (LST). Vegetation plays a crucial role in regulating LST by absorbing and releasing water vapor and providing shade. However, urban expansion often results in the replacement of vegetated areas with impervious surfaces, such as buildings and roads, which can lead to higher temperatures and altered microclimates.\n\nRemote sensing techniques offer an efficient and cost-effective approach to monitoring LULC changes and their impact on LST and vegetation indices. In this study, we investigate the relationship between LST, vegetation indices, and LULC in urbanized areas of Penang Island, Malaysia, using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data.\n\n2. Data and Methodology:\nWe used Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 5 TM data to extract LST, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). The spectral radiance model was used to extract the LST from Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 5 TM. The analysis on LULC changes revealed a phenomenal increase in the urban (high built-up area) areas and a decrease in the forest land area.\n\n3. Results:\nThe distribution of average changes in LST shows that urban (high built-up area) areas recorded the highest increase in temperature followed by urban (low built-up area) areas, grass land area, forest land area, and waterbodies. The correlation analysis between LST and NDVI indicates a strong correlation value for urban (high and low built-up areas), grass land area, and forest land area.\n\n4. Discussion:\nOur findings demonstrate that an increase in non-evaporating surfaces and a decrease in the vegetation area have increased the surface temperature and modified the temperature of the study area. The strong correlation between LST and NDVI suggests that urbanization is the main driver of the LULC changes on Penang Island.\n\n5. Conclusion:\nRemote sensing techniques were found to be efficient, especially in reducing the time for analysis of urban expansion, and are useful tools to evaluate the impact of urbanisation on LST. Our study highlights the importance of monitoring LULC changes and their impact on LST and vegetation indices to better understand the complex interactions between urbanization, climate, and ecosystem health.\n\nKeywords: Land use/land cover change, land surface temperature, vegetation index, urbanization, remote sensing, Penang Island.",

The study found that vegetation recovery occurred in the last decade, which was indicated by an increase in NDVI values. However, there was also a significant decrease in vegetated and bare land areas during the study period, with the most intensive conversion occurring in the first decade.\n\nThe third study investigates the temporal variability in urban microclimate in terms of LST and its correlation with LULC change in Lahore city for prediction of future impact patterns. Results revealed an overall increase of 41.8% in built-up areas at the expense of 24%, 17.4%, and 0.4% decreases in vegetation, bare land, and water from 1992\u20132020, respectively.

The authors find that current large language models are under-trained due to the recent focus on scaling up models while keeping training data constant. They propose that both model size and number of training tokens should be scaled equally for optimal performance. A 70B parameter model, Chinchilla, outperforms larger models like Gopher, GPT-3, Jurassic-1, and Megatron-Turing NLG on various downstream tasks while using less compute for fine-tuning and inference.\n\nLastly, there is ongoing research on building conversational agents with transformers (4). BlenderBot 3, a 175B parameter dialogue model, outperforms existing open-domain dialogue agents in human evaluations and has been deployed to interact with organic users.

These models, such as BERT and T5, are based on the transformer architecture which allows for parallel processing of sequences of arbitrary length (1). However, one limitation is their quadratic dependency on sequence length due to full attention mechanisms (4).\n\nTo address this issue, recent research proposes sparse attention mechanisms that reduce this dependency to linear, enabling handling of longer sequences and improved performance on tasks like question answering and summarization (4). For instance, BigBird uses a sparse attention mechanism called Longformer, which can handle sequences up to 8 times longer than previous models (4).\n\nAnother approach is instruction finetuning, where language models are fine-tuned on collections of datasets phrased as instructions to improve performance and generalization to unseen tasks (1). This method has been shown to dramatically enhance performance across various model classes, prompting setups, and evaluation benchmarks (1). For example, Flan-PaLM 540B instruction-finetuned on 1.8K tasks outperforms PaLM 540B by a large margin (1).\n\nMoreover, diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art results in image synthesis but require extensive computational resources for optimization and inference due to their pixel-based formulation (3). To enable training on limited resources while retaining quality and flexibility, researchers apply diffusion models in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders, leading to significant visual fidelity improvements (3).\n\nFurthermore, large-scale language models like CTRL are trained to condition on control codes that govern style, content, and task-specific behavior, providing more explicit control over text generation while preserving the advantages of unsupervised learning (5).

These studies cover topics such as coronal dynamics, quiescent solar corona modeling, Doppler shifts in the solar corona, elemental abundances in solar flares, and diagnostics of non-Maxwellian electron distributions in solar active regions using Hinode Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) and Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) observations.\n\n1. Coronal Dynamics: The authors investigate the dynamics of coronal loops, which are the basic structural elements of the corona. They find that hydrostatic solutions are stable only if the temperature maximum is located at the top of loop structures and the deposition scale length of the coronal heating mechanism is comparable with or larger than the loop scale size. The results suggest that fluctuations in the local heating rate can lead to dynamically unstable states within loops, which may be identified with transient loop brightenings, cooler coronal loop structures, and quiescent prominences.\n\n2. Quiescent Solar Corona Modeling: A new model of the quiescent X-ray corona is proposed, where it represents a metastable equilibrium state. The authors find that the loop temperature, pressure, and size are related by Tmax ~ 1.4 x 10^3 / (pL)^(1/3), which contains no free parameters. They also compare their results with observations obtained by the S-054 Skylab X-ray telescope and find that hydrostatic solutions are stable only if the temperature maximum is located at the top of loop structures, and the deposition scale length of the coronal heating mechanism is comparable with or larger than the loop scale size.\n\n3. Doppler Shifts in the Solar Corona: The authors measure the average Doppler shift between 0.01 and 2.1 MK for solar active regions using the Hinode Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) Spectropolarimeter. They find that the measured shifts are qualitatively and roughly quantitatively consistent with what is foreseen by 3D coronal models where heating is produced by dissipation of currents induced by photospheric motions and reconnection with emerging magnetic flux.\n\n4. Elemental Abundances in Solar Flares: The authors present measurements of elemental abundances in solar flares using the EUV Variability Experiment (EVE) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory. They find that the observed composition is close to photospheric, with a mean FIP bias of f = 1.17 \u00b1 0.22. This analysis suggests that the bulk of the plasma evaporated during a flare comes from deep in the chromosphere, below the region where elemental fractionation occurs.\n\n5. Diagnostics of Non-Maxwellian Electron Distributions: The authors present joint Hinode EIS and IRIS observations of Fe xii lines in active regions, both on-disk and off-limb. They find that the observed 192.4 \u00c5/1349 \u00c5 ratio is lower than expected by up to a factor of about two in some active region observations. After considering various physical mechanisms, they suggest that the most likely explanation for this discrepancy is the presence of non-Maxwellian electron distributions in the active regions.\n\n6. Solar Physics Research Highlights: This article provides a brief overview of recent solar physics research articles published in various journals, including studies on coronal dynamics, quiescent solar corona modeling, Doppler shifts in the solar corona, elemental abundances in solar flares, and diagnostics of non-Maxwellian electron distributions in solar active regions using Hinode EIS and IRIS observations.",
