<Context> 
Scientific synthesis generation involves creating a concise, coherent, and integrated summary from a collection of scientific texts (such as research paper titles and abstracts) that addresses a specific research problem. Unlike general text summarization, which may focus on extracting or abstracting key points from a single text or multiple texts on a broad topic, scientific synthesis is more specialized. It requires:

- Understanding and Addressing a Specific Research Problem: The synthesis must specifically answer a research problem, requiring a deep understanding of the subject matter and the ability to extract and integrate relevant information from various sources.
- Understanding and Addressing a Synthesis Type: We have created three different synthesis types: paper-wise (generic synthesized overview), methodological (synthesis of methods and their pertinent information), and thematic (synthesis of recurring themes or patterns). Aside from addressing a research problem, the information focus in a synthesis should be on the expected synthesis type. For instance, in methodological synthesis, only information focused on the method discussed in the paper abstracts should be provided as the synthesis result. Similarly, in a thematic synthesis, the scope should be limited to overarching themes of the research.
- Use of Scientific Literature: The process involves synthesizing information from scientific literature, such as research papers, focusing on the given titles and abstracts. This requires not only summarizing these texts but also evaluating their relevance, correctness, and completeness in the context of the research question.
- Synthesis Format: The synthesis output should be concisely presented in a single paragraph of not more than 200 words. This format requires distilling and integrating diverse scientific insights into a coherent and comprehensive summary that addresses the research problem directly. The single-paragraph format emphasizes the importance of concise and integrated communication of complex information.
- Synthesize vs. Summarize: The goal is to synthesize—meaning to combine elements to form a coherent whole—rather than just summarize each source individually. This involves integration, cohesion, and coherence of information from multiple sources, presenting it in a way that produces new insights or understanding in response to the research question.
- Referencing Source Material: Each claim or piece of information in the synthesis must be traceable to the source material (the abstracts), ensuring the synthesis's accuracy and reliability.
- Adherence to Quality Characteristic: It should be possible to evaluate the synthesis quality based on specific characteristic such as <characteristic-title>, ensuring it effectively communicates the synthesized information.

In essence, scientific synthesis generation is a complex task that goes beyond simply summarizing texts; it involves critically analyzing, integrating, and presenting scientific information from multiple sources to succinctly answer a targeted research problem, adhering to high standards of clarity, reliability, and insightfulness.

<Introduction>
You are tasked as a scientific syntheses quality evaluator.
</Introduction>

<Task-Description>
A user will provide you with a synthesis which has been generated as an answer to a research problem using the titles and abstracts of relevant research works.  You will also be provided with the research problem and the paper titles+abstracts of the relevant works that were synthesized. You must use the nine evaluation characteristics listed below to evaluate a given scientific synthesis. The general objective is that a synthesis should succinctly address the research problem by synthesizing only the content from the provided abstracts, while also referencing the source abstract for each claim.
</Task-Description>

<Evaluation-Characteristic>
<characteristic>
</Evaluation-Characteristic>

<Rating-Scale>
For <characteristic-title> characteristic, rate the quality from 1 (very bad) to 5 (very good). Follow the guidelines specified below for each rating.

<characteristic-description>
</Rating-Scale>

<Response-Format>
For characteristic rate the quality from 1 (very bad) to 5 (very good).  Provide a one sentence rationale for each rating. 
Return your response in JSON format: {characteristic : {‘rating’ : ‘’, ‘rationale’ : ‘’}}

</Response-Format>

<Note>
Your evaluation should be based solely on the content of the provided synthesis and abstracts. Ensure your rationale is objective and backed by specific examples from the provided material.
