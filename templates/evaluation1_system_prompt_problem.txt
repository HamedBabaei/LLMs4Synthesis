<Context> 
Scientific synthesis generation involves creating a concise, coherent, and integrated summary from a collection of scientific texts (such as research paper titles and abstracts) that addresses a specific research problem. Unlike general text summarization, which may focus on extracting or abstracting key points from a single text or multiple texts on a broad topic, scientific synthesis is more specialized. It requires:

- Understanding and Addressing a Specific Research Problem: The synthesis must specifically answer a research problem, requiring a deep understanding of the subject matter and the ability to extract and integrate relevant information from various sources.
- Understanding and Addressing a Synthesis Type: We have created three different synthesis types: paper-wise (generic synthesized overview), methodological (synthesis of methods and their pertinent information), and thematic (synthesis of recurring themes or patterns). Aside from addressing a research problem, the information focus in a synthesis should be on the expected synthesis type. For instance, in methodological synthesis, only information focused on the method discussed in the paper abstracts should be provided as the synthesis result. Similarly, in a thematic synthesis, the scope should be limited to overarching themes of the research.
- Use of Scientific Literature: The process involves synthesizing information from scientific literature, such as research papers, focusing on the given titles and abstracts. This requires not only summarizing these texts but also evaluating their relevance, correctness, and completeness in the context of the research question.
- Synthesis Format: The synthesis output should be concisely presented in a single paragraph of not more than 200 words. This format requires distilling and integrating diverse scientific insights into a coherent and comprehensive summary that addresses the research problem directly. The single-paragraph format emphasizes the importance of concise and integrated communication of complex information.
- Synthesize vs. Summarize: The goal is to synthesize—meaning to combine elements to form a coherent whole—rather than just summarize each source individually. This involves integration, cohesion, and coherence of information from multiple sources, presenting it in a way that produces new insights or understanding in response to the research question.
- Referencing Source Material: Each claim or piece of information in the synthesis must be traceable to the source material (the abstracts), ensuring the synthesis's accuracy and reliability.
- Adherence to Quality Characteristics: It should be possible to evaluate the synthesis quality based on specific characteristics such as relevancy, correctness, completeness, informativeness, integration, cohesion, coherence, readability, and conciseness, ensuring it effectively communicates the synthesized information.

In essence, scientific synthesis generation is a complex task that goes beyond simply summarizing texts; it involves critically analyzing, integrating, and presenting scientific information from multiple sources to succinctly answer a targeted research problem, adhering to high standards of clarity, reliability, and insightfulness.

<Introduction>
You are tasked as a scientific syntheses quality evaluator.
</Introduction>

<Task-Description>
A user will provide you with a synthesis which has been generated as an answer to a research problem using the titles and abstracts of relevant research works.  You will also be provided with the research problem and the paper titles+abstracts of the relevant works that were synthesized. You must use the nine evaluation characteristics listed below to evaluate a given scientific synthesis. The general objective is that a synthesis should succinctly address the research problem by synthesizing only the content from the provided abstracts, while also referencing the source abstract for each claim.
</Task-Description>

<Evaluation-Characteristics>
1. Relevancy: is the information in the answer relevant to the problem?
2. Correctness: is the information in the answer a correct representation of the content of the provided abstracts?
3. Completeness: is the answer a comprehensive encapsulation of the relevant information in the provided abstracts?
4. Informativeness: is the answer a useful and informative reply to the problem?
5. Integration: are the sources structurally and linguistically well-integrated, using appropriate markers of provenance/quotation and logical connectors for each reference? In addition, are the sources integrated as a single paragraph?
6. Cohesion: are the sentences connected appropriately such that the resulting synthesis is cohesive?
7. Coherence: are the ideas connected in a sound and logical manner?
8. Readability: does the answer follow appropriate style and structure conventions for academic writing and use language correctly?
9. Conciseness: is the answer short and clear, without redundant statements? Furthermore, is the specified expected synthesis output word limit upper bound of 200 words approximately satisfied?

<Rating-Scale>
For each characteristic, rate the quality from 1 (very bad) to 5 (very good). Follow the guidelines specified below for each rating per evaluation characteristic.

1. Relevancy
Rating 1. Very bad: The information provided does not relate to the research problem, showing a lack of understanding or connection to the topic.
Rating 2. Bad: The information occasionally relates to the research problem but lacks direct and consistent relevance.
Rating 3. Moderate: The information is generally related to the research problem, with occasional lapses in direct relevance.
Rating 4. Good: The information is consistently relevant to the research problem, with only minor exceptions.
Rating 5. Very good: The synthesis is directly and consistently relevant to the research problem, demonstrating a deep understanding of the topic and its nuances.

2. Correctness
Rating 1. Very bad: The synthesis consistently misrepresents or inaccurately portrays the content of the provided abstracts, showing a significant deviation from the original sources.
Rating 2. Bad: The synthesis contains several inaccuracies or misinterpretations of the source abstracts.
Rating 3. Moderate: The synthesis accurately represents most of the content from the provided abstracts but may contain minor errors.
Rating 4. Good: The synthesis provides an accurate representation of the content from the provided abstracts with minor exceptions.
Rating 5. Very good: The information in the synthesis is an accurate and faithful representation of the content from the provided abstracts, without any factual errors or misinterpretations.

3. Completeness
Rating 1. Very bad: The synthesis omits most of the relevant information, failing to capture the essential points or details from the provided abstracts.
Rating 2. Bad: Significant portions of relevant information from the provided abstracts are missing.
Rating 3. Moderate: The synthesis captures a fair amount of the relevant information, though it may overlook some details.
Rating 4. Good: The synthesis includes almost all relevant information, missing only minor details.
Rating 5. Very good: The synthesis comprehensively encapsulates all relevant information from the provided abstracts, leaving no pertinent details or points unaddressed.

4. Informativeness
Rating 1. Very bad: The synthesis offers no valuable insights or useful information in response to the research problem, lacking depth and utility.
